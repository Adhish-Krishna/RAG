To do this, I would
recommend ingesting milk and other dairy foods, green leafy vegetables, and intact canned sardines so she receives sufficient
calcium. Intact salmon would be a good source for calcium and vitamin D. Other fatty fish would also be a good vitamin D
source. 50 Astronauts floating in space were not exerting significant pressure on their bones; they were “weightless.” Without
the force of gravity exerting pressure on the bones, bone mass was lost. To alleviate this condition, astronauts now do resistive
exercise designed to apply forces to the bones and thus help keep them healthy. 51 Vitamin D is required for calcium absorption
by the gut. Low vitamin D could lead to insufficient levels of calcium in the blood so the calcium is being released from the
bones. The reduction of calcium from the bones can make them weak and subject to fracture. 52 Under “normal” conditions,
receptors in the parathyroid glands bind blood calcium.
