Propose reasons for fetal breathing movements
Â¢ Explain how the lungs become inflated after birth

Development of the respiratory system begins early in the fetus. It is a complex process that includes many structures,
most of which arise from the endoderm. Towards the end of development, the fetus can be observed making breathing
movements. Until birth, however, the mother provides all of the oxygen to the fetus as well as removes all of the fetal carbon
dioxide via the placenta.

CHAPTER 22 | THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 1009

Time Line

The development of the respiratory system begins at about week 4 of gestation. By week 28, enough alveoli have matured
that a baby born prematurely at this time can usually breathe on its own. The respiratory system, however, is not fully
developed until early childhood, when a full complement of mature alveoli is present.
