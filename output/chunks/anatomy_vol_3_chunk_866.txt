 Table 28.3 *Cow’s milk should never be given to an infant. Its composition is not suitable and its
proteins are difficult for the infant to digest.

 Colostrum is secreted during the first 48-72 hours postpartum. Only a small volume of colostrum is
produced—approximately 3 ounces in a 24-hour period—but it is sufficient for the newborn in the first few days of life.
