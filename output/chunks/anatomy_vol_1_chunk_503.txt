They are coiled glands lying deep in the dermis, with the duct rising up to a pore on the skin surface, where
the sweat is released. This type of sweat, released by exocytosis, is hypotonic and composed mostly of water, with some salt,
antibodies, traces of metabolic waste, and dermicidin, an antimicrobial peptide. Eccrine glands are a primary component of
thermoregulation in humans and thus help to maintain homeostasis.

Figure 5.14 Eccrine Gland Eccrine glands are coiled glands in the dermis that release sweat that is mostly water.

 An apocrine sweat gland is usually associated with hair follicles in densely hairy areas, such as armpits and genital
regions. Apocrine sweat glands are larger than eccrine sweat glands and lie deeper in the dermis, sometimes even reaching
the hypodermis, with the duct normally emptying into the hair follicle.
