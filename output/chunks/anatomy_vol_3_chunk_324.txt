On the other hand, if the net
energy change is negative (catabolic reactions release less energy than anabolic reactions use), the body uses stored energy
to compensate for the deficiency of energy released by catabolism.

 Catabolic Reactions

Catabolic reactions break down large organic molecules into smaller molecules, releasing the energy contained in the
chemical bonds. These energy releases (conversions) are not 100 percent efficient. The amount of energy released is less
than the total amount contained in the molecule. Approximately 40 percent of energy yielded from catabolic reactions is
directly transferred to the high-energy molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP, the energy currency of cells, can be
used immediately to power molecular machines that support cell, tissue, and organ function. This includes building new
tissue and repairing damaged tissue. ATP can also be stored to fulfill future energy demands. The remaining 60 percent of
the energy released from catabolic reactions is given off as heat, which tissues and body fluids absorb.
