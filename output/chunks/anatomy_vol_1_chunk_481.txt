Cells in this layer are shed periodically and are replaced by cells pushed up from the stratum granulosum (or stratum
lucidum in the case of the palms and soles of feet). The entire layer is replaced during a period of about 4 weeks. Cosmetic
procedures, such as microdermabrasion, help remove some of the dry, upper layer and aim to keep the skin looking “fresh”
and healthy.

 Dermis

The dermis might be considered the “core” of the integumentary system (derma- = “skin”), as distinct from the epidermis
(epi- = “upon” or “over”) and hypodermis (hypo- = “below”). It contains blood and lymph vessels, nerves, and other
structures, such as hair follicles and sweat glands. The dermis is made of two layers of connective tissue that compose an
interconnected mesh of elastin and collagenous fibers, produced by fibroblasts (Figure 5.7).
