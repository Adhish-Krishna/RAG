About 80 to 90 percent of people
with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese. In type 2 diabetes, cells become resistant to the effects of insulin. In
response, the pancreas increases its insulin secretion, but over time, the beta cells become exhausted. In many cases,
type 2 diabetes can be reversed by moderate weight loss, regular physical activity, and consumption of a healthy diet;
however, if blood glucose levels cannot be controlled, the diabetic will eventually require insulin.

 Two of the early manifestations of diabetes are excessive urination and excessive thirst. They demonstrate how the
out-of-control levels of glucose in the blood affect kidney function. The kidneys are responsible for filtering glucose
from the blood. Excessive blood glucose draws water into the urine, and as a result the person eliminates an abnormally
large quantity of sweet urine. The use of body water to dilute the urine leaves the body dehydrated, and so the person is
unusually and continually thirsty.
