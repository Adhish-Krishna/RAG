Although glucose
can be more concentrated outside of a cell, it cannot cross the lipid bilayer via simple diffusion because it is both large and
polar. To resolve this, a specialized carrier protein called the glucose transporter will transfer glucose molecules into the cell
to facilitate its inward diffusion.
