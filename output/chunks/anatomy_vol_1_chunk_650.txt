Inside the cranial
cavity, the frontal bone extends posteriorly. This flattened region forms both the roof of the orbit below and the floor of the
anterior cranial cavity above (see Figure 7.8b).

Occipital Bone

The occipital bone is the single bone that forms the posterior skull and posterior base of the cranial cavity (Figure 7.9;
see also Figure 7.8). On its outside surface, at the posterior midline, is a small protrusion called the external occipital
protuberance, which serves as an attachment site for a ligament of the posterior neck. Lateral to either side of this bump is
a superior nuchal line (nuchal = “nape” or “posterior neck”). The nuchal lines represent the most superior point at which
muscles of the neck attach to the skull, with only the scalp covering the skull above these lines. On the base of the skull, the
occipital bone contains the large opening of the foramen magnum, which allows for passage of the spinal cord as it exits
the skull.
