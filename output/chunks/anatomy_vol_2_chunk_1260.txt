When the ambient
temperature is warm, more blood is diverted to the superficial veins where heat can be more easily dissipated to the
environment. In colder weather, there is more constriction of the superficial veins and blood is diverted deeper where the
body can retain more of the heat.

 The “Voyage of Discovery” analogy and stick drawings mentioned earlier remain valid techniques for the study of
systemic veins, but veins present a more difficult challenge because there are numerous anastomoses and multiple branches.
 It is like following a river with many tributaries and channels, several of which interconnect. Tracing blood flow through
arteries follows the current in the direction of blood flow, so that we move from the heart through the large arteries and into
the smaller arteries to the capillaries. From the capillaries, we move into the smallest veins and follow the direction of blood
flow into larger veins and back to the heart.
