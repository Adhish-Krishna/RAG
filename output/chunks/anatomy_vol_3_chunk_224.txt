During each phase, the secretion of gastric juice can be stimulated or inhibited.

 The cephalic phase (reflex phase) of gastric secretion, which is relatively brief, takes place before food enters the
stomach. The smell, taste, sight, or thought of food triggers this phase. For example, when you bring a piece of sushi to your
lips, impulses from receptors in your taste buds or the nose are relayed to your brain, which returns signals that increase
gastric secretion to prepare your stomach for digestion. This enhanced secretion is a conditioned reflex, meaning it occurs
only if you like or want a particular food. Depression and loss of appetite can suppress the cephalic reflex.

 The gastric phase of secretion lasts 3 to 4 hours, and is set in motion by local neural and hormonal mechanisms
triggered by the entry of food into the stomach.
