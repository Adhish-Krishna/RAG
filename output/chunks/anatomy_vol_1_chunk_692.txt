Each of these is thus called a primary curve because they are retained from the original fetal curvature of the
vertebral column.

 A secondary curve develops gradually after birth as the child learns to sit upright, stand, and walk. Secondary curves
are concave posteriorly, opposite in direction to the original fetal curvature. The cervical curve of the neck region develops
as the infant begins to hold their head upright when sitting. Later, as the child begins to stand and then to walk, the lumbar
curve of the lower back develops. In adults, the lumbar curve is generally deeper in females.

 Disorders associated with the curvature of the spine include kyphosis (an excessive posterior curvature of the thoracic
region), lordosis (an excessive anterior curvature of the lumbar region), and scoliosis (an abnormal, lateral curvature,
accompanied by twisting of the vertebral column).
