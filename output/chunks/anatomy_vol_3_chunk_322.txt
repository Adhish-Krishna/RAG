Metabolism varies, depending on age, gender, activity level, fuel consumption, and lean body mass. Your own
metabolic rate fluctuates throughout life. By modifying your diet and exercise regimen, you can increase both lean body
mass and metabolic rate. Factors affecting metabolism also play important roles in controlling muscle mass. Aging is known
to decrease the metabolic rate by as much as 5 percent per year. Additionally, because men tend have more lean muscle
mass then women, their basal metabolic rate (metabolic rate at rest) is higher; therefore, men tend to burn more calories
than women do. Lastly, an individual’s inherent metabolic rate is a function of the proteins and enzymes derived from their
genetic background. Thus, your genes play a big role in your metabolism. Nonetheless, each person’s body engages in the
same overall metabolic processes.
