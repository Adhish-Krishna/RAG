The technique for determining an Apgar score is quick and easy, painless for the newborn, and does not require
any instruments except for a stethoscope. A convenient way to remember the five scoring criteria is to apply the
mnemonic APGAR, for “appearance” (skin color), “pulse” (heart rate), “grimace” (reflex), “activity” (muscle tone),
and “respiration.”

Of the five Apgar criteria, heart rate and respiration are the most critical. Poor scores for either of these
measurements may indicate the need for immediate medical attention to resuscitate or stabilize the newborn. In general,
any score lower than 7 at the 5-minute mark indicates that medical assistance may be needed. A total score below
5 indicates an emergency situation. Normally, a newborn will get an intermediate score of 1 for some of the Apgar
criteria and will progress to a 2 by the 5-minute assessment.
