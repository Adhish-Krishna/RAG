Movement of the head and neck using the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles is controlled by the accessory
nerve. Flexing of the neck and strength testing of those muscles reviews the function of that nerve.

 16.4 | The Sensory and Motor Exams

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the arrangement of sensory and motor regions in the spinal cord
¢ Relate damage in the spinal cord to sensory or motor deficits
¢ Differentiate between upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron diseases
* Describe the clinical indications of common reflexes

Connections between the body and the CNS occur through the spinal cord. The cranial nerves connect the head and neck
directly to the brain, but the spinal cord receives sensory input and sends motor commands out to the body through the spinal
nerves. Whereas the brain develops into a complex series of nuclei and fiber tracts, the spinal cord remains relatively simple
in its configuration (Figure 16.12).
