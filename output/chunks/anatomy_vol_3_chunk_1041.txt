41 Lung compliance refers to the ability of lung tissue to stretch under pressure, which is
determined in part by the surface tension of the alveoli and the ability of the connective tissue to stretch. Lung compliance plays a
role in determining how much the lungs can change in volume, which in turn helps to determine pressure and air movement. 42
Quiet breathing occurs at rest and without active thought. During quiet breathing, the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles
work at different extents, depending on the situation. For inspiration, the diaphragm contracts, causing the diaphragm to flatten
and drop towards the abdominal cavity, helping to expand the thoracic cavity. The external intercostal muscles contract as well,
causing the rib cage to expand, and the rib cage and sternum to move outward, also expanding the thoracic cavity. Expansion of
the thoracic cavity also causes the lungs to expand, due to the adhesiveness of the pleural fluid.
