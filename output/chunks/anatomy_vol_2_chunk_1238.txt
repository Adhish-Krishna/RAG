CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION

Aortic Arch Branches and Brain Circulation

Vessel

Brachiocephalic
artery

Subclavian
artery

Description

Single vessel located on the right side of the body; the first vessel branching from the aortic
arch; gives rise to the right subclavian artery and the right common carotid artery; supplies
blood to the head, neck, upper limb, and wall of the thoracic region

The right subclavian artery arises from the brachiocephalic artery while the left subclavian
artery arises from the aortic arch; gives rise to the internal thoracic, vertebral, and
thyrocervical arteries; supplies blood to the arms, chest, shoulders, back, and central
nervous system

Internal thoracic
artery

Also called the mammary artery; arises from the subclavian artery; supplies blood to the
thymus, pericardium of the heart, and anterior chest wall

Vertebral artery

Arises from the subclavian artery and passes through the vertebral foramen through the
foramen magnum to the brain; joins with the internal carotid artery to form the arterial circle;
supplies blood to the brain and spinal cord

Thyrocervical
artery

Arises from the subclavian artery; supplies blood to the thyroid, the cervical region, the
upper back, and shoulder

Common
carotid artery

The right common carotid artery arises from the brachiocephalic artery and the left common
carotid artery arises from the aortic arch; each gives rise to the external and internal carotid
arteries; supplies the respective sides of the head and neck

External carotid
artery

Arises from the common carotid artery; supplies blood to numerous structures within the
face, lower jaw, neck, esophagus, and larynx

Internal carotid
artery

Arises from the common carotid artery and begins with the carotid sinus; goes through the
carotid canal of the temporal bone to the base of the brain; combines with the branches of
the vertebral artery, forming the arterial circle; supplies blood to the brain

Arterial circle or
circle of Willis

An anastomosis located at the base of the brain that ensures continual blood supply; formed
from the branches of the internal carotid and vertebral arteries; supplies blood to the brain

Anterior
cerebral artery

Arises from the internal carotid artery; supplies blood to the frontal lobe of the cerebrum

Middle cerebral
artery

Another branch of the internal carotid artery; supplies blood to the temporal and parietal
lobes of the cerebrum

Ophthalmic
artery

Anterior
communicating
artery

Branch of the internal carotid artery; supplies blood to the eyes

An anastomosis of the right and left internal carotid arteries; supplies blood to the brain

Posterior
communicating
artery

Branches of the posterior cerebral artery that form part of the posterior portion of the arterial
circle; supplies blood to the brain

Posterior
cerebral artery

Branch of the basilar artery that forms a portion of the posterior segment of the arterial circle
of Willis; supplies blood to the posterior portion of the cerebrum and brain stem

Basilar artery

Table 20.6

Formed from the fusion of the two vertebral arteries; sends branches to the cerebellum,
brain stem, and the posterior cerebral arteries; the main blood supply to the brain stem

Thoracic Aorta and Major Branches

The thoracic aorta begins at the level of vertebra T5 and continues through to the diaphragm at the level of T12, initially
traveling within the mediastinum to the left of the vertebral column.
