Keep this theme in mind
as you tour the inside of a cell and are introduced to the various types of cells in the body.

 A primary responsibility of each cell is to contribute to homeostasis. Homeostasis is a term used in biology that refers
to a dynamic state of balance within parameters that are compatible with life. For example, living cells require a water-based
environment to survive in, and there are various physical (anatomical) and physiological mechanisms that keep all of the
trillions of living cells in the human body moist. This is one aspect of homeostasis. When a particular parameter, such as
blood pressure or blood oxygen content, moves far enough out of homeostasis (generally becoming too high or too low),
illness or disease—and sometimes death—inevitably results.
