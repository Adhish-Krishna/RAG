A variety of enzymes are enlisted during DNA replication. These enzymes unwind the DNA molecule,
separate the two strands, and assist with the building of complementary strands along each parent strand. The original
DNA strands serve as templates from which the nucleotide sequence of the new strands are determined and synthesized.
 When replication is completed, two identical DNA molecules exist. Each one contains one original strand and one newly
synthesized complementary strand.

 3.4 Protein Synthesis

DNA stores the information necessary for instructing the cell to perform all of its functions. Cells use the genetic code
stored within DNA to build proteins, which ultimately determine the structure and function of the cell. This genetic code
lies in the particular sequence of nucleotides that make up each gene along the DNA molecule. To “read” this code, the
cell must perform two sequential steps. In the first step, transcription, the DNA code is converted into a RNA code. A
molecule of messenger RNA that is complementary to a specific gene is synthesized in a process similar to DNA replication.
