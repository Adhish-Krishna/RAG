It is felt as a dull, aching pain around the front of the knee and deep to the patella.
 The pain may be felt when walking or running, going up or down stairs, kneeling or squatting, or after sitting with the
knee bent for an extended period.

 Patellofemoral syndrome may be initiated by a variety of causes, including individual variations in the shape and
movement of the patella, a direct blow to the patella, or flat feet or improper shoes that cause excessive turning in or
out of the feet or leg. These factors may cause in an imbalance in the muscle pull that acts on the patella, resulting in
an abnormal tracking of the patella that allows it to deviate too far toward the lateral side of the patellar surface on the
distal femur.
