Recall that bilirubin, a product of erythrocyte breakdown, is processed by the liver and
secreted in bile. It enters the gastrointestinal tract and exits the body in the stool. Breast milk has laxative properties that
help expel meconium from the intestines and clear bilirubin through the excretion of bile. A high concentration of bilirubin
in the blood causes jaundice. Some degree of jaundice is normal in newborns, but a high level of bilirubin—which is
neurotoxic—can cause brain damage. Newborns, who do not yet have a fully functional blood-brain barrier, are highly
vulnerable to the bilirubin circulating in the blood. Indeed, hyperbilirubinemia, a high level of circulating bilirubin, is
the most common condition requiring medical attention in newborns. Newborns with hyperbilirubinemia are treated with
phototherapy because UV light helps to break down the bilirubin quickly.
