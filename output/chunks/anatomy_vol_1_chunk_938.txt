Temporomandibular Joint

The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is the joint that allows for opening (mandibular depression) and closing (mandibular
elevation) of the mouth, as well as side-to-side and protraction/retraction motions of the lower jaw. This joint involves
the articulation between the mandibular fossa and articular tubercle of the temporal bone, with the condyle (head) of the
mandible. Located between these bony structures, filling the gap between the skull and mandible, is a flexible articular disc
(Figure 9.15). This disc serves to smooth the movements between the temporal bone and mandibular condyle.

 Movement at the TMJ during opening and closing of the mouth involves both gliding and hinge motions of the
mandible. With the mouth closed, the mandibular condyle and articular disc are located within the mandibular fossa of the
temporal bone. During opening of the mouth, the mandible hinges downward and at the same time is pulled anteriorly,
causing both the condyle and the articular disc to glide forward from the mandibular fossa onto the downward projecting
articular tubercle.
