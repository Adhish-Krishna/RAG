Hypothalamus

Inferior and slightly anterior to the thalamus is the hypothalamus, the other major region of the diencephalon. The
hypothalamus is a collection of nuclei that are largely involved in regulating homeostasis. The hypothalamus is the
executive region in charge of the autonomic nervous system and the endocrine system through its regulation of the anterior
pituitary gland. Other parts of the hypothalamus are involved in memory and emotion as part of the limbic system.

Figure 13.11 The Diencephalon The diencephalon is composed primarily of the thalamus and hypothalamus, which
together define the walls of the third ventricle. The thalami are two elongated, ovoid structures on either side of the
midline that make contact in the middle. The hypothalamus is inferior and anterior to the thalamus, culminating in a
sharp angle to which the pituitary gland is attached.

 Brain Stem

The midbrain and hindbrain (composed of the pons and the medulla) are collectively referred to as the brain stem (Figure
13.12).
