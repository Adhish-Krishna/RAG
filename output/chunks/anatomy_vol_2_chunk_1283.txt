The great saphenous vein is a prominent surface vessel located on the medial surface of the leg and thigh that
collects blood from the superficial portions of these areas. The deep femoral vein, as the name suggests, drains blood from
the deeper portions of the thigh. The femoral circumflex vein forms a loop around the femur just inferior to the trochanters
and drains blood from the areas in proximity to the head and neck of the femur.

 As the femoral vein penetrates the body wall from the femoral portion of the upper limb, it becomes the external iliac
vein, a large vein that drains blood from the leg to the common iliac vein. The pelvic organs and integument drain into the
internal iliac vein, which forms from several smaller veins in the region, including the umbilical veins that run on either
side of the bladder. The external and internal iliac veins combine near the inferior portion of the sacroiliac joint to form the
common iliac vein.
