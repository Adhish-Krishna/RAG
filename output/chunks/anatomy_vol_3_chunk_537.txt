for urine formation

The major hormones influencing total body water are ADH, aldosterone, and ANH. Circumstances that lead to fluid
depletion in the body include blood loss and dehydration. Homeostasis requires that volume and osmolarity be preserved.
 Blood volume is important in maintaining sufficient blood pressure, and there are nonrenal mechanisms involved in its
preservation, including vasoconstriction, which can act within seconds of a drop in pressure. Thirst mechanisms are also
activated to promote the consumption of water lost through respiration, evaporation, or urination. Hormonal mechanisms
are activated to recover volume while maintaining a normal osmotic environment. These mechanisms act principally on the
kidney.

 Volume-sensing Mechanisms

The body cannot directly measure blood volume, but blood pressure can be measured. Blood pressure often reflects blood
volume and is measured by baroreceptors in the aorta and carotid sinuses.
