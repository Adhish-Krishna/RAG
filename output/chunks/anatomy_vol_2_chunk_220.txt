The
spinal cord is not the full length of the vertebral column because the spinal cord does not grow significantly longer after
the first or second year, but the skeleton continues to grow. The nerves that emerge from the spinal cord pass through the
intervertebral formina at the respective levels. As the vertebral column grows, these nerves grow with it and result in a long
bundle of nerves that resembles a horse’s tail and is named the cauda equina. The sacral spinal cord is at the level of the
upper lumbar vertebral bones. The spinal nerves extend from their various levels to the proper level of the vertebral column.

 Gray Horns

In cross-section, the gray matter of the spinal cord has the appearance of an ink-blot test, with the spread of the gray matter
on one side replicated on the other—a shape reminiscent of a bulbous capital “H.” As shown in Figure 13.14, the gray
matter is subdivided into regions that are referred to as horns.
