Respiratory Compensation

Respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis increases the respiratory rate to drive off CO2 and readjust the bicarbonate
to carbonic acid ratio to the 20:1 level. This adjustment can occur within minutes. Respiratory compensation for metabolic
alkalosis is not as adept as its compensation for acidosis. The normal response of the respiratory system to elevated pH
is to increase the amount of COz2 in the blood by decreasing the respiratory rate to conserve CO2. There is a limit to the
decrease in respiration, however, that the body can tolerate. Hence, the respiratory route is less efficient at compensating for
metabolic alkalosis than for acidosis.

 Metabolic Compensation

Metabolic and renal compensation for respiratory diseases that can create acidosis revolves around the conservation of
bicarbonate ions. In cases of respiratory acidosis, the kidney increases the conservation of bicarbonate and secretion of
