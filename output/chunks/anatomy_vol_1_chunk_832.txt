The navicular and
lateral cuneiform bones also articulate with the medial side of the cuboid bone.

Use this tutorial (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/footbones) to review the bones of the foot. Which tarsal bones are in
the proximal, intermediate, and distal groups?

Metatarsal Bones

The anterior half of the foot is formed by the five metatarsal bones, which are located between the tarsal bones of the
posterior foot and the phalanges of the toes (see Figure 8.19). These elongated bones are numbered 1-5, starting with
the medial side of the foot. The first metatarsal bone is shorter and thicker than the others. The second metatarsal is the
longest. The base of the metatarsal bone is the proximal end of each metatarsal bone. These articulate with the cuboid
or cuneiform bones. The base of the fifth metatarsal has a large, lateral expansion that provides for muscle attachments.
