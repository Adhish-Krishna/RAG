Cells, for example, have a cell membrane (also referred to as the plasma membrane) that keeps the intracellular
environment—the fluids and organelles—separate from the extracellular environment. Blood vessels keep blood inside
a closed circulatory system, and nerves and muscles are wrapped in connective tissue sheaths that separate them from
surrounding structures. In the chest and abdomen, a variety of internal membranes keep major organs such as the lungs,
heart, and kidneys separate from others.

 The body’s largest organ system is the integumentary system, which includes the skin and its associated structures,
such as hair and nails. The surface tissue of skin is a barrier that protects internal structures and fluids from potentially
harmful microorganisms and other toxins.

 Energy Transfer and Metabolism

The first law of thermodynamics holds that energy can neither be created nor destroyed—it can only change form. Your
basic function as an organism is to consume (ingest) energy and molecules in the foods you eat, convert some of it into fuel
‘or Movement, sustain your body functions, and build and maintain your body structures.
