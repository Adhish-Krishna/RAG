The peripheral chemoreceptors are
responsible for sensing large changes in blood oxygen levels. If blood oxygen levels become quite low—about 60 mm
Hg or less—then peripheral chemoreceptors stimulate an increase in respiratory activity. The chemoreceptors are only able
to sense dissolved oxygen molecules, not the oxygen that is bound to hemoglobin. As you recall, the majority of oxygen
is bound by hemoglobin; when dissolved levels of oxygen drop, hemoglobin releases oxygen. Therefore, a large drop in
oxygen levels is required to stimulate the chemoreceptors of the aortic arch and carotid arteries.

 The hypothalamus and other brain regions associated with the limbic system also play roles in influencing the
regulation of breathing by interacting with the respiratory centers. The hypothalamus and other regions associated with
the limbic system are involved in regulating respiration in response to emotions, pain, and temperature. For example, an
increase in body temperature causes an increase in respiratory rate. Feeling excited or the fight-or-flight response will also
result in an increase in respiratory rate.
