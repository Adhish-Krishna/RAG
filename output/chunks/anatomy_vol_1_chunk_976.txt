The
cartilaginous joints in which vertebrae are united by intervertebral discs provide for small movements between the adjacent
vertebrae and are also an amphiarthrosis type of joint. Thus, based on their movement ability, both fibrous and cartilaginous
joints are functionally classified as a synarthrosis or amphiarthrosis.

 The most common type of joint is the diarthrosis, which is a freely moveable joint. All synovial joints are functionally
classified as diarthroses. A uniaxial diarthrosis, such as the elbow, is a joint that only allows for movement within a single
anatomical plane. Joints that allow for movements in two planes are biaxial joints, such as the metacarpophalangeal joints
of the fingers. A multiaxial joint, such as the shoulder or hip joint, allows for three planes of motions.

 9.2 Fibrous Joints

Fibrous joints are where adjacent bones are strongly united by fibrous connective tissue. The gap filled by connective tissue
may be narrow or wide. The three types of fibrous joints are sutures, gomphoses, and syndesmoses.
