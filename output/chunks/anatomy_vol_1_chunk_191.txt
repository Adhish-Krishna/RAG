The pH of human blood normally ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, although it is typically identified as pH 7.4. At this slightly basic
pH, blood can reduce the acidity resulting from the carbon dioxide (CO2) constantly being released into the bloodstream
by the trillions of cells in the body. Homeostatic mechanisms (along with exhaling CO2 while breathing) normally keep the
pH of blood within this narrow range. This is critical, because fluctuations—either too acidic or too alkaline—can lead to
life-threatening disorders.
