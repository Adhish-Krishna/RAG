Figure 2.7 Electron Shells Electrons orbit the atomic nucleus at distinct levels of energy called electron shells.
 (a) With one electron, hydrogen only half-fills its electron shell. Helium also has a single shell, but its two electrons
completely fill it. (b) The electrons of carbon completely fill its first electron shell, but only half-fills its second. (c) Neon,
an element that does not occur in the body, has 10 electrons, filling both of its electron shells.

 The factor that most strongly governs the tendency of an atom to participate in chemical reactions is the number of
electrons in its valence shell. A valence shell is an atomâ€™s outermost electron shell. If the valence shell is full, the atom is
stable; meaning its electrons are unlikely to be pulled away from the nucleus by the electrical charge of other atoms.
