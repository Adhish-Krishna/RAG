The second task, graphesthesia, is to recognize numbers or letters written on the palm of the hand with a dull pointer, such

 Praxis and gnosis are related to the conscious perception and cortical processing of sensory information. Being able
to transform verbal commands into a sequence of motor responses, or to manipulate and recognize a common object and
associate it with a name for that object. Both subtests have language components because language function is integral
to these functions. The relationship between the words that describe actions, or the nouns that represent objects, and
the cerebral location of these concepts is suggested to be localized to particular cortical areas. Certain aphasias can be
characterized by a deficit of verbs or nouns, known as V impairment or N impairment, or may be classified as V-N
dissociation. Patients have difficulty using one type of word over the other. To describe what is happening in a photograph
as part of the expressive language subtest, a patient will use active- or image-based language.
