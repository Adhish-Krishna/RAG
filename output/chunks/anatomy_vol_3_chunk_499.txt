Both ions are moved in opposite directions from a lower to a higher concentration.

 Simple diffusion moves a substance from a higher to a lower concentration down its concentration gradient. It requires
no energy and only needs to be soluble.

 Facilitated diffusion is similar to diffusion in that it moves a substance down its concentration gradient. The difference
is that it requires specific membrane receptors or channel proteins for movement. The movement of glucose and, in certain

situations, Na‚Äù ions, is an example of facilitated diffusion. In some cases of facilitated diffusion, two different substances
share the same channel protein port; these mechanisms are described by the terms symport and antiport.

Symport mechanisms move two or more substances in the same direction at the same time, whereas antiport
mechanisms move two or more substances in opposite directions across the cell membrane.
