 Lipid Digestion

A healthy diet limits lipid intake to 35 percent of total calorie intake. The most common dietary lipids are triglycerides,
which are made up of a glycerol molecule bound to three fatty acid chains. Small amounts of dietary cholesterol and
phospholipids are also consumed.

 The three lipases responsible for lipid digestion are lingual lipase, gastric lipase, and pancreatic lipase. However,
because the pancreas is the only consequential source of lipase, virtually all lipid digestion occurs in the small intestine.
 Pancreatic lipase breaks down each triglyceride into two free fatty acids and a monoglyceride. The fatty acids include both
short-chain (less than 10 to 12 carbons) and long-chain fatty acids.
