The person should (and normally does) respond by drinking water. The hypothalamus of a dehydrated person
also releases antidiuretic hormone (ADH) through the posterior pituitary gland. ADH signals the kidneys to recover water
from urine, effectively diluting the blood plasma. To conserve water, the hypothalamus of a dehydrated person also sends
signals via the sympathetic nervous system to the salivary glands in the mouth. The signals result in a decrease in watery,
serous output (and an increase in stickier, thicker mucus output). These changes in secretions result in a “dry mouth” and
the sensation of thirst.
