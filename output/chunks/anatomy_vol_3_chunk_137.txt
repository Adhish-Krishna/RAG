Both are important in gas exchange, as ventilation must be sufficient to create a high partial pressure of oxygen
in the alveoli. If ventilation is insufficient and the partial pressure of oxygen drops in the alveolar air, the capillary is
constricted and blood flow is redirected to alveoli with sufficient ventilation. External respiration refers to gas exchange
that occurs in the alveoli, whereas internal respiration refers to gas exchange that occurs in the tissue. Both are driven by
partial pressure differences.

22.5 Transport of Gases

Oxygen is primarily transported through the blood by erythrocytes. These cells contain a metalloprotein called hemoglobin,
which is composed of four subunits with a ring-like structure. Each subunit contains one atom of iron bound to a molecule
of heme. Heme binds oxygen so that each hemoglobin molecule can bind up to four oxygen molecules. When all of the
heme units in the blood are bound to oxygen, hemoglobin is considered to be saturated.
