Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ETchain) to learn about the electron transport chain.

 The electrons released from NADH and FADH?2 are passed along the chain by each of the carriers, which are reduced
when they receive the electron and oxidized when passing it on to the next carrier. Each of these reactions releases a small

amount of energy, which is used to pump H‚Äù ions across the inner membrane. The accumulation of these protons in the
space between the membranes creates a proton gradient with respect to the mitochondrial matrix.
 Also embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane is an amazing protein pore complex called ATP synthase.

 Effectively, it is a turbine that is powered by the flow of H* ions across the inner membrane down a gradient and into the

mitochondrial matrix. As the H* ions traverse the complex, the shaft of the complex rotates. This rotation enables other
portions of ATP synthase to encourage ADP and Pj to create ATP.
