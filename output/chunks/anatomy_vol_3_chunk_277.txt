Pancreatic enzymes are active in the digestion of sugars, proteins, and fats.

 The pancreas produces protein-digesting enzymes in their inactive forms. These enzymes are activated in the
duodenum. If produced in an active form, they would digest the pancreas (which is exactly what occurs in the disease,
pancreatitis). The intestinal brush border enzyme enteropeptidase stimulates the activation of trypsin from trypsinogen of
the pancreas, which in turn changes the pancreatic enzymes procarboxypeptidase and chymotrypsinogen into their active
forms, carboxypeptidase and chymotrypsin.

 The enzymes that digest starch (amylase), fat (lipase), and nucleic acids (nuclease) are secreted in their active forms,
since they do not attack the pancreas as do the protein-digesting enzymes.

 Pancreatic Secretion

Regulation of pancreatic secretion is the job of hormones and the parasympathetic nervous system. The entry of acidic
chyme into the duodenum stimulates the release of secretin, which in turn causes the duct cells to release bicarbonate-
rich pancreatic juice.
