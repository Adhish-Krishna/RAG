The mole of an element is its atomic weight, while a mole of a compound is the sum of the atomic
weights of its components, called the molecular weight. An often-used example is calculating a mole of glucose, with the
chemical formula CgH120¢. Using the periodic table, the atomic weight of carbon (C) is 12.011 grams (g), and there are six
carbons in glucose, for a total atomic weight of 72.066 g. Doing the same calculations for hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O),
the molecular weight equals 180.156g (the “gram molecular weight” of glucose). When water is added to make one liter of
solution, you have one mole (1M) of glucose. This is particularly useful in chemistry because of the relationship of moles

to “Avogadro’s number.” A mole of any solution has the same number of particles in it: 6.02 x 10°, Many substances in
the bloodstream and other tissue of the body are measured in thousandths of a mole, or millimoles (mM).
