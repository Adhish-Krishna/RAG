Anterior to that are
the premotor cortex, Brocaâ€™s area, and the frontal eye fields, which are all related to planning certain types of movements.
 Anterior to what could be described as motor association areas are the regions of the prefrontal cortex. They are the regions
in which judgment, abstract reasoning, and working memory are localized. The antecedents to planning certain movements
are judging whether those movements should be made, as in the example of deciding whether to hit the snooze button.

 To an extent, the prefrontal cortex may be related to personality. The neurological exam does not necessarily assess
personality, but it can be within the realm of neurology or psychiatry. A clinical situation that suggests this link between
the prefrontal cortex and personality comes from the story of Phineas Gage, the railroad worker from the mid-1800s who
had a metal spike impale his prefrontal cortex.
