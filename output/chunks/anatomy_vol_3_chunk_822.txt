The foramen ovale
allows oxygenated
blood in the right
atrium to reach the
left atrium.

 Oxygenated blood from placenta enters
right atrium via inferior vena cava.

 Inferior vena cava

The ductus
venosus shunts
oxygenated
blood from

the placenta
away from the
semifunctional
liver and toward
the heart.

 Umbilical cord
(contains umbilical
artery and umbilical vein)

Blood arrives
via umbilical
vein.

 Figure 28.17 Fetal Circulatory System The fetal circulatory system includes three shunts to divert blood from
undeveloped and partially functioning organs, as well as blood supply to and from the placenta.

 Other Organ Systems

During weeks 9-12 of fetal development, the brain continues to expand, the body elongates, and ossification continues.
 Fetal movements are frequent during this period, but are jerky and not well-controlled. The bone marrow begins to take
over the process of erythrocyte productionâ€”a task that the liver performed during the embryonic period.
