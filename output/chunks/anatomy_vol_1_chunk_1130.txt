The
majority of skeletal muscles in the body have this type of organization. Some parallel muscles are flat sheets that expand at
the ends to make broad attachments. Other parallel muscles are rotund with tendons at one or both ends. Muscles that seem
to be plump have a large mass of tissue located in the middle of the muscle, between the insertion and the origin, which is
known as the central body. A more common name for this muscle is belly. When a muscle contracts, the contractile fibers
shorten it to an even larger bulge. For example, extend and then flex your biceps brachii muscle; the large, middle section
is the belly (Figure 11.4). When a parallel muscle has a central, large belly that is spindle-shaped, meaning it tapers as it
extends to its origin and insertion, it sometimes is called fusiform.
