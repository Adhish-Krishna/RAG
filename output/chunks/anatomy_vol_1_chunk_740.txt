The deep posterior cranial fossa extends from the petrous ridge to the occipital bone. Openings here include the
large foramen magnum, plus the internal acoustic meatus, jugular foramina, and hypoglossal canals. Additional openings
located on the external base of the skull include the stylomastoid foramen and the entrance to the carotid canal.
 The anterior skull has the orbits that house the eyeballs and associated muscles. The walls of the orbit are formed by
contributions from seven bones: the frontal, zygomatic, maxillary, palatine, ethmoid, lacrimal, and sphenoid. Located at the
superior margin of the orbit is the supraorbital foramen, and below the orbit is the infraorbital foramen. The mandible has
two openings, the mandibular foramen on its inner surface and the mental foramen on its external surface near the chin.
