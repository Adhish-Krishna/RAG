7 The proximal group of tarsal bones includes the
calcaneus and talus bones, the navicular bone is intermediate, and the distal group consists of the cuboid bone plus the medial,
intermediate, and lateral cuneiform bones. 8 A bunion results from the deviation of the big toe toward the second toe, which
causes the distal end of the first metatarsal bone to stick out. A bunion may also be caused by prolonged pressure on the foot from
pointed shoes with a narrow toe box that compresses the big toe and pushes it toward the second toe. 9 (a) The upper limb bud
initially appears on day 26 as the upper limb ridge. This becomes the upper limb bud by day 28. (b) The handplate and footplate
appear at day 36. (c) Rotation of the upper and lower limbs begins during the seventh week (day 48). 10B 11C 12D 13A 14
