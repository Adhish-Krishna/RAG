An
important difference in this reflex is that plantar flexion is most likely in progress as the foot is pressing down onto the tack.
 Contraction of the tibialis anterior is not the most important aspect of the reflex, as continuation of plantar flexion will result
in further damage from stepping onto the tack.

 Another type of reflex is a stretch reflex. In this reflex, when a skeletal muscle is stretched, a muscle spindle receptor
is activated. The axon from this receptor structure will cause direct contraction of the muscle. A collateral of the muscle
spindle fiber will also inhibit the motor neuron of the antagonist muscles. The reflex helps to maintain muscles at a constant
length. A common example of this reflex is the knee jerk that is elicited by a rubber hammer struck against the patellar
ligament in a physical exam.

 A specialized reflex to protect the surface of the eye is the corneal reflex, or the eye blink reflex.
