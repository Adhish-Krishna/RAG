The evaporation of the sweat from the surface of the skin cools the body by dissipating heat. 30 When the core
body temperature drops, the body switches to heat-conservation mode. This can include an inhibition to excessive sweating and

a decrease of blood flow to the papillary layers of the skin. This reduction of blood flow helps conserve body heat. 31 Acne
results from a blockage of sebaceous glands by sebum. The blockage causes blackheads to form, which are susceptible to infection.
 The infected tissue then becomes red and inflamed. Teenagers experience this at high rates because the sebaceous glands become
active during puberty. Hormones that are especially active during puberty stimulate the release of sebum, leading in many cases to
blockages. 32 Scars are made of collagen and do not have the cellular structure of normal skin. The tissue is fibrous and does not
allow for the regeneration of accessory structures, such as hair follicles, and sweat or sebaceous glands.
