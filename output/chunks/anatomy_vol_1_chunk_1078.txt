Cellular damage to muscle fibers that occurs after intense exercise includes damage
to the sarcolemma and myofibrils. This muscle damage contributes to the feeling of soreness after strenuous exercise, but
muscles gain mass as this damage is repaired, and additional structural proteins are added to replace the damaged ones.
 Overworking skeletal muscles can also lead to tendon damage and even skeletal damage if the load is too great for the
muscles to bear.

 Performance-Enhancing Substances

Some athletes attempt to boost their performance by using various agents that may enhance muscle performance. Anabolic
steroids are one of the more widely known agents used to boost muscle mass and increase power output. Anabolic steroids
are a form of testosterone, a male sex hormone that stimulates muscle formation, leading to increased muscle mass.

 Endurance athletes may also try to boost the availability of oxygen to muscles to increase aerobic respiration by using
substances such as erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone normally produced in the kidneys, which triggers the production of
red blood cells.
