Surprisingly, aspirin overdose—salicylate toxicity—can result in respiratory alkalosis as
the body tries to compensate for initial acidosis.

What effect does high altitude have on blood pH, and why?

Compensation Mechanisms

Various compensatory mechanisms exist to maintain blood pH within a narrow range, including buffers, respiration, and
renal mechanisms. Although compensatory mechanisms usually work very well, when one of these mechanisms is not
working properly (like kidney failure or respiratory disease), they have their limits. If the pH and bicarbonate to carbonic
acid ratio are changed too drastically, the body may not be able to compensate. Moreover, extreme changes in pH can
denature proteins. Extensive damage to proteins in this way can result in disruption of normal metabolic processes, serious
tissue damage, and ultimately death.
