Similar to a child’s balloon animal, the long, straight neural tube begins to take on a new
shape. Three vesicles form at the first stage, which are called primary vesicles. These vesicles are given names that are
based on Greek words, the main root word being enkephalon, which means “brain” (en- = “inside”; kephalon = “head”).
 The prefix to each generally corresponds to its position along the length of the developing nervous system.

 The prosencephalon (pros- = “in front”) is the forward-most vesicle, and the term can be loosely translated to mean
forebrain. The mesencephalon (mes- = “middle”) is the next vesicle, which can be called the midbrain. The third vesicle
at this stage is the rhombencephalon. The first part of this word is also the root of the word rhombus, which is a geometrical
figure with four sides of equal length (a square is a rhombus with 90° angles).
