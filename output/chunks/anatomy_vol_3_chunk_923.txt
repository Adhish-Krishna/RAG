34 In a sealed bottle of sparkling water, carbon
dioxide gas is kept dissolved in the water under a very high pressure. When you open the bottle, the pressure of the gas above
the liquid changes from artificially high to normal atmospheric pressure. The dissolved carbon dioxide gas expands, and rises in
bubbles to the surface. When a bottle of sparkling water is left open, it eventually goes flat because its gases continue to move
out of solution until the pressure in the water is approximately equal to atmospheric pressure. 35 The primary way that the body
responds to high environmental heat is by sweating; however, sweating requires water, which comes from body fluids, including
blood plasma. If Josh becomes dehydrated, he will be unable to sweat adequately to cool his body, and he will be at risk for heat
stroke as his blood pressure drops too much from the loss of water from the blood plasma.
