AMS typically can occur at 2400 meters (8000 feet) above sea
level. AMS is a result of low blood oxygen levels, as the body has acute difficulty adjusting to the low partial pressure
of oxygen. In serious cases, AMS can cause pulmonary or cerebral edema. Symptoms of AMS include nausea, vomiting,
fatigue, lightheadedness, drowsiness, feeling disoriented, increased pulse, and nosebleeds. The only treatment for AMS is
descending to a lower altitude; however, pharmacologic treatments and supplemental oxygen can improve symptoms. AMS
can be prevented by slowly ascending to the desired altitude, allowing the body to acclimate, as well as maintaining proper
hydration.

 Acclimatization

Especially in situations where the ascent occurs too quickly, traveling to areas of high altitude can cause AMS.
 Acclimatization is the process of adjustment that the respiratory system makes due to chronic exposure to a high altitude.
 Over a period of time, the body adjusts to accommodate the lower partial pressure of oxygen.
