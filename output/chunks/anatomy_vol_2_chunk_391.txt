When vision is fixed on an object in space, closer objects
will fall on the lateral retina of each eye, and more distant objects will fall on the medial retina of either eye (Figure
14.25). This is easily observed by holding a finger up in front of your face as you look at a more distant object. You
will see two images of your finger that represent the two disparate images that are falling on either retina.

 These depth cues, both monocular and binocular, can be exploited to make the brain think there are three
dimensions in two-dimensional information. This is the basis of 3-D movies. The projected image on the screen is two
dimensional, but it has disparate information embedded in it. The 3-D glasses that are available at the theater filter the
information so that only one eye sees one version of what is on the screen, and the other eye sees the other version.
