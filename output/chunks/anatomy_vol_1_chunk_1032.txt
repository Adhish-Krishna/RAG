As long as Ca** ions remain in the sarcoplasm to bind to troponin, and as long as ATP is available, the
muscle fiber will continue to shorten.

 Muscle contraction usually stops when signaling from the motor neuron ends, which repolarizes the sarcolemma and

T-tubules, and closes the voltage-gated calcium channels in the SR. Ca** ions are then pumped back into the SR, which
causes the tropomyosin to reshield (or re-cover) the binding sites on the actin strands. A muscle also can stop contracting
when it runs out of ATP and becomes fatigued (Figure 10.9).
