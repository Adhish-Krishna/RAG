Figure 19.12 Heart Valves With the atria and major vessels removed, all four valves are clearly visible, although it
difficult to distinguish the three separate cusps of the tricuspid valve.

 Emerging from the right ventricle at the base of the pulmonary trunk is the pulmonary semilunar valve, or tl

pulmonary valve; it is also known as the pulmonic valve or the right semilunar valve. The pulmonary valve is comprised
of three small flaps of endothelium reinforced with connective tissue. When the ventricle relaxes, the pressure differential

causes blood to flow back into the ventricle from the pulmonary trunk. This flow of blood fills the pocket-like flaps of t

pulmonary valve, causing the valve to close and producing an audible sound. Unlike the atrioventricular valves, there are

no papillary muscles or chordae tendineae associated with the pulmonary valve.
