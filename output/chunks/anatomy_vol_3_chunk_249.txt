Structure

he large intestine runs from the appendix to the anus. It frames the small intestine on three sides. Despite its being about
one-half as long as the small intestine, it is called large because it is more than twice the diameter of the small intestine,
about 3 inches.

 Subdivisions

he large intestine is subdivided into four main regions: the cecum, the colon, the rectum, and the anus. The ileocecal valve,
located at the opening between the ileum and the large intestine, controls the flow of chyme from the small intestine to the
large intestine.

 Cecum

he first part of the large intestine is the cecum, a sac-like structure that is suspended inferior to the ileocecal valve. It is
about 6 cm (2.4 in) long, receives the contents of the ileum, and continues the absorption of water and salts.
