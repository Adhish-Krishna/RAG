Table 26.3 Reference values (arterial): pH: 7.35-7.45;
pCOz2: male: 35-48 mm Hg, female: 32-45 mm Hg; total
venous bicarbonate: 22-29 mM. N denotes normal; t
denotes a rising or increased value; and | denotes a
falling or decreased value.

 Metabolic alkalosis

Respiratory alkalosis N, then |

Metabolic acidosis is problematic, as lower-than-normal amounts of bicarbonate are present in the blood. The pCO2
would be normal at first, but if compensation has occurred, it would decrease as the body reestablishes the proper ratio of
bicarbonate and carbonic acid/CO2.

 Respiratory acidosis is problematic, as excess COz is present in the blood. Bicarbonate levels would be normal at
first, but if compensation has occurred, they would increase in an attempt to reestablish the proper ratio of bicarbonate and
carbonic acid/CO2.
