With 20 times more bicarbonate than carbonic acid, this capture system is most efficient at buffering changes that
would make the blood more acidic. This is useful because most of the bodyâ€™s metabolic wastes, such as lactic acid and
ketones, are acids. Carbonic acid levels in the blood are controlled by the expiration of COz2 through the lungs. In red
blood cells, carbonic anhydrase forces the dissociation of the acid, rendering the blood less acidic. Because of this acid
dissociation, CO2 is exhaled (see equations above). The level of bicarbonate in the blood is controlled through the renal
system, where bicarbonate ions in the renal filtrate are conserved and passed back into the blood. However, the bicarbonate
buffer is the primary buffering system of the IF surrounding the cells in tissues throughout the body.

 Respiratory Regulation of Acid-Base Balance

The respiratory system contributes to the balance of acids and bases in the body by regulating the blood levels of carbonic
acid (Figure 26.16).
