The lateral rectus is controlled by neurons of the
abducens nucleus in the superior medulla, whereas the medial rectus is controlled by neurons in the oculomotor nucleus of
the midbrain.

 Coordinated movement of both eyes through different nuclei requires integrated processing through the brain stem.
 In the midbrain, the superior colliculus integrates visual stimuli with motor responses to initiate eye movements. The
paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) will initiate a rapid eye movement, or saccade, to bring the eyes to bear
on a visual stimulus quickly. These areas are connected to the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nuclei by the medial
longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) that runs through the majority of the brain stem. The MLF allows for conjugate gaze, or
the movement of the eyes in the same direction, during horizontal movements that require the lateral and medial rectus
muscles. Control of conjugate gaze strictly in the vertical direction is contained within the oculomotor complex. To elevate
the eyes, the oculomotor nerve on either side stimulates the contraction of both superior rectus muscles; to depress the eyes,
the oculomotor nerve on either side stimulates the contraction of both inferior rectus muscles.
