41 Lemon juice is
one hundred times more acidic than orange juice. This means that lemon juice has a one hundred-fold greater concentration of

hydrogen ions. 42 Lemon juice, like any acid, releases hydrogen ions in solution. As excessive H’* enters the digestive tract and
is absorbed into blood, Eli’s blood pH falls below 7.35. Recall that bicarbonate is a buffer, a weak base that accepts hydrogen
ions. By administering bicarbonate intravenously, the emergency department physician helps raise Eli’s blood pH back toward
neutral. 43 Maltose contains 12 atoms of carbon, but only 22 atoms of hydrogen and 11 atoms of oxygen, because a molecule
of water is removed during its formation via dehydration synthesis. 44 All lipids are hydrophobic and unable to dissolve in the
watery environment of blood. They are packaged into lipoproteins, whose outer protein envelope enables them to transport fats in
the bloodstream.
