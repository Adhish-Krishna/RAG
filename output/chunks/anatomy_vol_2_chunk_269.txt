The other plexus from the cervical level is the brachial plexus. Spinal nerves C4 through T1 reorganize through
this plexus to give rise to the nerves of the arms, as the name brachial suggests. A large nerve from this plexus is the radial
nerve from which the axillary nerve branches to go to the armpit region. The radial nerve continues through the arm and is
paralleled by the ulnar nerve and the median nerve. The lumbar plexus arises from all the lumbar spinal nerves and gives
rise to nerves enervating the pelvic region and the anterior leg. The femoral nerve is one of the major nerves from this
plexus, which gives rise to the saphenous nerve as a branch that extends through the anterior lower leg. The sacral plexus
comes from the lower lumbar nerves L4 and L5 and the sacral nerves S1 to S4. The most significant systemic nerve to come
from this plexus is the sciatic nerve, which is a combination of the tibial nerve and the fibular nerve.
