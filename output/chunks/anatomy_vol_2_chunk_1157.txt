Since pressure in the veins is normally relatively low, for blood to
flow back into the heart, the pressure in the atria during atrial diastole must be even lower. It normally approaches zero,
except when the atria contract (see Figure 20.10).

 Cardiac Output

Cardiac output is the measurement of blood flow from the heart through the ventricles, and is usually measured in liters
per minute. Any factor that causes cardiac output to increase, by elevating heart rate or stroke volume or both, will elevate
blood pressure and promote blood flow. These factors include sympathetic stimulation, the catecholamines epinephrine and
norepinephrine, thyroid hormones, and increased calcium ion levels. Conversely, any factor that decreases cardiac output,
by decreasing heart rate or stroke volume or both, will decrease arterial pressure and blood flow. These factors include
parasympathetic stimulation, elevated or decreased potassium ion levels, decreased calcium levels, anoxia, and acidosis.
