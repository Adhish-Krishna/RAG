Not only does the tunica albuginea cover the outside of
the testis, it also invaginates to form septa that divide the testis into 300 to 400 structures called lobules. Within the lobules,
sperm develop in structures called seminiferous tubules. During the seventh month of the developmental period of a male
fetus, each testis moves through the abdominal musculature to descend into the scrotal cavity. This is called the “descent of
the testis.” Cryptorchidism is the clinical term used when one or both of the testes fail to descend into the scrotum prior to
birth.
