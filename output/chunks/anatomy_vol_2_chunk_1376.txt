This association of antigen and MHC occurs inside the cell, and it is the complex of the two that is brought to the
surface. The peptide-binding cleft is a small indentation at the end of the MHC molecule that is furthest away from the
cell membrane; it is here that the processed fragment of antigen sits. MHC molecules are capable of presenting a variety of
antigens, depending on the amino acid sequence, in their peptide-binding clefts. It is the combination of the MHC molecule
and the fragment of the original peptide or carbohydrate that is actually physically recognized by the T cell receptor (Figure
21.17).

T cell
receptor

Â® The MHC proteins, now carrying
antigens, are released from the vesicle
and travel to the outer surface of the
cell membrane.
