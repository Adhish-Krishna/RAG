Metaphase is the second stage of mitosis. During this stage, the sister chromatids, with their attached microtubules,
line up along a linear plane in the middle of the cell. A metaphase plate forms between the centrosomes that are now located
at either end of the cell. The metaphase plate is the name for the plane through the center of the spindle on which the sister
chromatids are positioned. The microtubules are now poised to pull apart the sister chromatids and bring one from each pair
to each side of the cell.

 Anaphase is the third stage of mitosis. Anaphase takes place over a few minutes, when the pairs of sister chromatids
are separated from one another, forming individual chromosomes once again. These chromosomes are pulled to opposite
ends of the cell by their kinetochores, as the microtubules shorten. Each end of the cell receives one partner from each pair
of sister chromatids, ensuring that the two new daughter cells will contain identical genetic material.
