Healing of fractures begins with the formation of a hematoma, followed by
internal and external calli. Osteoclasts resorb dead bone, while osteoblasts create new bone that replaces the cartilage in the
calli. The calli eventually unite, remodeling occurs, and healing is complete.

6.6 Exercise, Nutrition, Hormones, and Bone Tissue

Mechanical stress stimulates the deposition of mineral salts and collagen fibers within bones. Calcium, the predominant
mineral in bone, cannot be absorbed from the small intestine if vitamin D is lacking. Vitamin K supports bone mineralization
and may have a synergistic role with vitamin D. Magnesium and fluoride, as structural elements, play a supporting role
in bone health. Omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammation and may promote production of new osseous tissue. Growth
hormone increases the length of long bones, enhances mineralization, and improves bone density. Thyroxine stimulates
bone growth and promotes the synthesis of bone matrix. The sex hormones (estrogen in women; testosterone in men)
promote osteoblastic activity and the production of bone matrix, are responsible for the adolescent growth spurt, and
