What are the structures that
produce CSF and where are they found? How are the
structures indicated in this animation?

10. Figure 13.20 If you zoom in on the DRG, you can see
smaller satellite glial cells surrounding the large cell bodies
of the sensory neurons. From what structure do satellite cells
derive during embryologic development?

11. Figure 13.22 To what structures in a skeletal muscle are
the endoneurium, perineurium, and epineurium comparable?

12. Visit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/
NYTmeningitis) to read about a man who wakes with a
headache and a loss of vision. His regular doctor sent him
to an ophthalmologist to address the vision loss. The
ophthalmologist recognizes a greater problem and
immediately sends him to the emergency room. Once there,
the patient undergoes a large battery of tests, but a definite
cause cannot be found. A specialist recognizes the problem
as meningitis, but the question is what caused it originally.
