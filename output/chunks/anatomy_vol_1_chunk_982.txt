This type of joint is found between the articular processes of adjacent vertebrae, at the acromioclavicular joint, or at the
intercarpal joints of the hand and intertarsal joints of the foot. Ball-and-socket joints, in which the rounded head of a bone
â€˜its into a large depression or socket, are found at the shoulder and hip joints. Both plane and ball-and-sockets joints are
classified functionally as multiaxial joints. However, ball-and-socket joints allow for large movements, while the motions
between bones at a plane joint are small.
