For example, at the atlantoaxial joint, the first cervical (C1) vertebra (atlas) rotates around the dens,
the upward projection from the second cervical (C2) vertebra (axis). This allows the head to rotate from side to side as when
shaking the head “no.” The proximal radioulnar joint is a pivot joint formed by the head of the radius and its articulation
with the ulna. This joint allows for the radius to rotate along its length during pronation and supination movements of the
forearm.

 Rotation can also occur at the ball-and-socket joints of the shoulder and hip. Here, the humerus and femur rotate around
their long axis, which moves the anterior surface of the arm or thigh either toward or away from the midline of the body.
 Movement that brings the anterior surface of the limb toward the midline of the body is called medial (internal) rotation.
