Respiratory System: Sleep Apnea

Sleep apnea is a chronic disorder that can occur in children or adults, and is characterized by the cessation of breathing
during sleep. These episodes may last for several seconds or several minutes, and may differ in the frequency with
which they are experienced. Sleep apnea leads to poor sleep, which is reflected in the symptoms of fatigue, evening
napping, irritability, memory problems, and morning headaches. In addition, many individuals with sleep apnea
experience a dry throat in the morning after waking from sleep, which may be due to excessive snoring.

 There are two types of sleep apnea: obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea is
caused by an obstruction of the airway during sleep, which can occur at different points in the airway, depending on the
underlying cause of the obstruction.
