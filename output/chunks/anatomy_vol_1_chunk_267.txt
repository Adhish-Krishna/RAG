Having an internal body temperature around 98.6. F thus also
aids in diffusion of particles within the body.

 Visit this link (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/diffusion) to see diffusion and how it is propelled by the kinetic energy
of molecules in solution. How does temperature affect diffusion rate, and why?

 Whenever a substance exists in greater concentration on one side of a semipermeable membrane, such as the cell
membranes, any substance that can move down its concentration gradient across the membrane will do so. Consider
substances that can easily diffuse through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, such as the gases oxygen (O2) and CO2. O2
generally diffuses into cells because it is more concentrated outside of them, and CO? typically diffuses out of cells because
it is more concentrated inside of them. Neither of these examples requires any energy on the part of the cell, and therefore
they use passive transport to move across the membrane.
