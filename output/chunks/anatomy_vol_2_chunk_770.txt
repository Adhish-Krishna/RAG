As a result, blood levels of melatonin fall,
promoting wakefulness. In contrast, as light levels decline—such as during the evening—melatonin production increases,
boosting blood levels and causing drowsiness.

melatonin. What should you avoid doing in the middle of your sleep cycle that would lower melatonin?

 The secretion of melatonin may influence the body’s circadian rhythms, the dark-light fluctuations that affect not only
sleepiness and wakefulness, but also appetite and body temperature. Interestingly, children have higher melatonin levels
than adults, which may prevent the release of gonadotropins from the anterior pituitary, thereby inhibiting the onset of
puberty. Finally, an antioxidant role of melatonin is the subject of current research.

 Jet lag occurs when a person travels across several time zones and feels sleepy during the day or wakeful at night.
