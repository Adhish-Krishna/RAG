This condition can occur in individuals with a deficiency of iron in the diet and is
especially common in teens and children as well as in vegans and vegetarians. Additionally, iron deficiency anemia
may be caused by either an inability to absorb and transport iron or slow, chronic bleeding.

 * Vitamin-deficient anemias generally involve insufficient vitamin B12 and folate.

 ° Megaloblastic anemia involves a deficiency of vitamin B12 and/or folate, and often involves diets deficient in
these essential nutrients. Lack of meat or a viable alternate source, and overcooking or eating insufficient amounts
of vegetables may lead to a lack of folate.

 ° Pernicious anemia is caused by poor absorption of vitamin B12 and is often seen in patients with Crohn’s disease
(a severe intestinal disorder often treated by surgery), surgical removal of the intestines or stomach (common in
some weight loss surgeries), intestinal parasites, and AIDS.
