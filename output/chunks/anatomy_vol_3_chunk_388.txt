Because of this, levels of phenylalanine rise to toxic levels in the body, which results in damage to
the central nervous system and brain. Symptoms include delayed neurological development, hyperactivity, mental
retardation, seizures, skin rash, tremors, and uncontrolled movements of the arms and legs. Pregnant women with
PKU are at a high risk for exposing the fetus to too much phenylalanine, which can cross the placenta and affect
fetal development. Babies exposed to excess phenylalanine in utero may present with heart defects, physical and/or
mental retardation, and microcephaly. Every infant in the United States and Canada is tested at birth to determine
whether PKU is present. The earlier a modified diet is begun, the less severe the symptoms will be. The person must
closely follow a strict diet that is low in phenylalanine to avoid symptoms and damage. Phenylalanine is found in
high concentrations in artificial sweeteners, including aspartame. Therefore, these sweeteners must be avoided. Some
animal products and certain starches are also high in phenylalanine, and intake of these foods should be carefully
monitored.
