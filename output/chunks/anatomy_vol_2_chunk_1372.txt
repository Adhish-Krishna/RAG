T Cell-Mediated Immune Responses

The primary cells that control the adaptive immune response are the lymphocytes, the T and B cells. T cells are particularly
important, as they not only control a multitude of immune responses directly, but also control B cell immune responses in
many cases as well. Thus, many of the decisions about how to attack a pathogen are made at the T cell level, and knowledge
of their functional types is crucial to understanding the functioning and regulation of adaptive immune responses as a whole.

 T lymphocytes recognize antigens based on a two-chain protein receptor. The most common and important of these
are the alpha-beta T cell receptors (Figure 21.15).
