Triglycerides

A triglyceride is one of the most common dietary lipid groups, and the type found most abundantly in body tissues. This
compound, which is commonly referred to as a fat, is formed from the synthesis of two types of molecules (Figure 2.21):
* A glycerol backbone at the core of triglycerides, consists of three carbon atoms.
 * Three fatty acids, long chains of hydrocarbons with a carboxy! group and a methyl! group at opposite ends, extend from
each of the carbons of the glycerol.

 Three fatty acid chains are bound to glycerol by dehydration synthesis,

synthesis.
