The locations
of the arteries in the brain not only provide blood flow to the brain tissue but also prevent interruption in the flow of
blood. Both the carotid and vertebral arteries branch once they enter the cranial cavity, and some of these branches form a
structure known as the arterial circle (or circle of Willis), an anastomosis that is remarkably like a traffic circle that sends
off branches (in this case, arterial branches to the brain). As a rule, branches to the anterior portion of the cerebrum are
normally fed by the internal carotid arteries; the remainder of the brain receives blood flow from branches associated with
the vertebral arteries.

 The internal carotid artery continues through the carotid canal of the temporal bone and enters the base of the brain
through the carotid foramen where it gives rise to several branches (Figure 20.26 and Figure 20.27).
