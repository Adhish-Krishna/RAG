The cosmetic use of belladonna
extract was essentially acting on this response. Atropine is no longer used in this cosmetic capacity for reasons related to the
other name for the plant, which is deadly nightshade. Suppression of parasympathetic function, especially when it becomes
systemic, can be fatal. Autonomic regulation is disrupted and anticholinergic symptoms develop. The berries of this plant
are highly toxic, but can be mistaken for other berries. The antidote for atropine or scopolamine poisoning is pilocarpine.

 Figure 15.15 Belladonna Plant The plant from the genus Atropa, which is known as belladonna or deadly
nightshade, was used cosmetically to dilate pupils, but can be fatal when ingested. The berries on the plant may seem
attractive as a fruit, but they contain the same anticholinergic compounds as the rest of the plant.
