CHAPTER 4 | THE TISSUE LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION 135

Tissue Membranes

A tissue membrane is a thin layer or sheet of cells that covers the outside of the body (for example, skin), the organs (for
example, pericardium), internal passageways that lead to the exterior of the body (for example, abdominal mesenteries), and
the lining of the moveable joint cavities. There are two basic types of tissue membranes: connective tissue and epithelial
membranes (Figure 4.4).

 Mucous membranes line the
digestive, respiratory, urinary,
and reproductive tracts. They
are coated with the secretions
of mucous glands.

 Serous membranes line body
cavities closed to the exterior
of the body: the peritoneal,
pleural, and pericardial
cavities.
