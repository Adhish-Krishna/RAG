Treppe

When a skeletal muscle has been dormant for an extended period and then activated to contract, with all other things being
equal, the initial contractions generate about one-half the force of later contractions. The muscle tension increases in a
graded manner that to some looks like a set of stairs. This tension increase is called treppe, a condition where muscle
contractions become more efficient. It’s also known as the “staircase effect” (Figure 10.17).

Figure 10.17 Treppe When muscle tension increases in a graded manner that looks like a set of stairs, it is called
treppe. The bottom of each wave represents the point of stimulus.

 It is believed that treppe results from a higher concentration of Ca** in the sarcoplasm resulting from the steady stream
of signals from the motor neuron.
