The
scala vestibuli extends from the oval window, travelling above the cochlear duct, which is the central cavity of the cochlea
that contains the sound-transducing neurons. At the uppermost tip of the cochlea, the scala vestibuli curves over the top of
the cochlear duct. The fluid-filled tube, now called the scala tympani, returns to the base of the cochlea, this time travelling
under the cochlear duct. The scala tympani ends at the round window, which is covered by a membrane that contains the
fluid within the scala. As vibrations of the ossicles travel through the oval window, the fluid of the scala vestibuli and scala
tympani moves in a wave-like motion. The frequency of the fluid waves match the frequencies of the sound waves (Figure
14.6). The membrane covering the round window will bulge out or pucker in with the movement of the fluid within the
scala tympani.
