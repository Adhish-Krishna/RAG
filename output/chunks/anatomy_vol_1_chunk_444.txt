Tissue and Aging

 According to poet Ralph Waldo Emerson, “The surest poison is time.” In fact, biology confirms that many functions of
the body decline with age. All the cells, tissues, and organs are affected by senescence, with noticeable variability between
individuals owing to different genetic makeup and lifestyles. The outward signs of aging are easily recognizable. The skin
and other tissues become thinner and drier, reducing their elasticity, contributing to wrinkles and high blood pressure.
 Hair turns gray because follicles produce less melanin, the brown pigment of hair and the iris of the eye. The face looks
flabby because elastic and collagen fibers decrease in connective tissue and muscle tone is lost. Glasses and hearing aids
may become parts of life as the senses slowly deteriorate, all due to reduced elasticity.
