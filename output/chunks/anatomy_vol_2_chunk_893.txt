Although rupture of larger vessels usually requires medical intervention, hemostasis is quite effective in
dealing with small, simple wounds. There are three steps to the process: vascular spasm, the formation of a platelet plug,
and coagulation (blood clotting). Failure of any of these steps will result in hemorrhageâ€”excessive bleeding.

 Vascular Spasm

When a vessel is severed or punctured, or when the wall of a vessel is damaged, vascular spasm occurs. In vascular spasm,
the smooth muscle in the walls of the vessel contracts dramatically. This smooth muscle has both circular layers; larger
vessels also have longitudinal layers. The circular layers tend to constrict the flow of blood, whereas the longitudinal layers,
when present, draw the vessel back into the surrounding tissue, often making it more difficult for a surgeon to locate, clamp,
and tie off a severed vessel.
