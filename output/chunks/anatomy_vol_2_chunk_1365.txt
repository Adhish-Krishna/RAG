The inflammatory reaction brings
in phagocytic cells to the damaged area to clear cellular debris and to set the stage for wound repair (Figure 21.14).

CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 937

@ Mast cells detect injury to
nearby cells and release
histamine, initiating
inflammatory response.

 Histamine increases blood
flow to the wound sites,
bringing in phagocytes and
other immune cells that

neutralize pathogens. The
blood influx causes the
wound to swell, redden, and
become warm and painful.

This reaction also brings in the cells of the innate immune system, allowing them to get rid of the sources of a possible
infection. Inflammation is part of a very basic form of immune response. The process not only brings fluid and cells into
the site to destroy the pathogen and remove it and debris from the site, but also helps to isolate the site, limiting the spread
of the pathogen.
