When oxygen is limited or absent, pyruvate enters an anaerobic pathway. In these reactions, pyruvate can be converted
into lactic acid. In addition to generating an additional ATP, this pathway serves to keep the pyruvate concentration low

so glycolysis continues, and it oxidizes NADH into the NAD‚Äù needed by glycolysis. In this reaction, lactic acid replaces

oxygen as the final electron acceptor. Anaerobic respiration occurs in most ce

ls of the body when oxygen is limited or

mitochondria are absent or nonfunctional. For example, because erythrocytes (red blood cells) lack mitochondria, they must
produce their ATP from anaerobic respiration. This is an effective pathway of ATP production for short periods of time,
ranging from seconds to a few minutes. The lactic acid produced diffuses into the plasma and is carried to the liver, where
it is converted back into pyruvate or glucose via the Cori cycle.
