Brain: Prosopagnosia

The failures of sensory perception can be unusual and debilitating. A particular sensory deficit that inhibits an
important social function of humans is prosopagnosia, or face blindness. The word comes from the Greek words
prosopa, that means “faces,” and agnosia, that means “not knowing.” Some people may feel that they cannot recognize
people easily by their faces. However, a person with prosopagnosia cannot recognize the most recognizable people in
their respective cultures. They would not recognize the face of a celebrity, an important historical figure, or even a
family member like their mother. They may not even recognize their own face.

 Prosopagnosia can be caused by trauma to the brain, or it can be present from birth. The exact cause of
proposagnosia and the reason that it happens to some people is unclear. A study of the brains of people born
with the deficit found that a specific region of the brain, the anterior fusiform gyrus of the temporal lobe, is often
underdeveloped.
