From here,
the veins come together to form the radial vein, the ulnar vein, and the median antebrachial vein. The radial vein and the
ulnar vein parallel the bones of the forearm and join together at the antebrachium to form the brachial vein, a deep vein
that flows into the axillary vein in the brachium.

 The median antebrachial vein parallels the ulnar vein, is more medial in location, and joins the basilic vein in the
forearm. As the basilic vein reaches the antecubital region, it gives off a branch called the median cubital vein that crosses
at an angle to join the cephalic vein. The median cubital vein is the most common site for drawing venous blood in humans.
 The basilic vein continues through the arm medially and superficially to the axillary vein.

 The cephalic vein begins in the antebrachium and drains blood from the superficial surface of the arm into the axillary
vein. It is extremely superficial and easily seen along the surface of the biceps brachii muscle in individuals with good
muscle tone and in those without excessive subcutaneous adipose tissue in the arms.
