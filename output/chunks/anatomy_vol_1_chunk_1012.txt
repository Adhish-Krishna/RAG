The striations
are visible with a light microscope under high magnification (see Figure 10.2). Skeletal muscle fibers are multinucleated
structures that compose the skeletal muscle. Cardiac muscle fibers each have one to two nuclei and are physically and
electrically connected to each other so that the entire heart contracts as one unit (called a syncytium).

 Because the actin and myosin are not arranged in such regular fashion in smooth muscle, the cytoplasm of a smooth
muscle fiber (which has only a single nucleus) has a uniform, nonstriated appearance (resulting in the name smooth muscle).
 However, the less organized appearance of smooth muscle should not be interpreted as less efficient. Smooth muscle in the
walls of arteries is a critical component that regulates blood pressure necessary to push blood through the circulatory system;
and smooth muscle in the skin, visceral organs, and internal passageways is essential for moving all materials through the
body.
