1. Watch this video  (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/
fightflight) to learn more about adrenaline and the fight-
or-flight response. When someone is said to have a rush
of adrenaline, the image of bungee jumpers or skydivers
usually comes to mind. But adrenaline, also known as
epinephrine, is an important chemical in coordinating the
body’s fight-or-flight response. In this video, you look inside
the physiology of the fight-or-flight response, as envisioned
for a firefighter. His body’s reaction is the result of the
sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system
causing system-wide changes as it prepares for extreme
responses. What two changes does adrenaline bring about to
help the skeletal muscle response?
