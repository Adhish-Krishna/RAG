In a state of copper deficiency, the

transport of iron for heme synthesis decreases, and iron can accumulate in tissues, where it can eventually lead to organ
damage.

 * Zinc. The trace mineral zinc functions as a co-enzyme that facilitates the synthesis of the heme portion of hemoglobin.

 * B vitamins. The B vitamins folate and vitamin B12 function as co-enzymes that facilitate DNA synthesis. Thus, both
are critical for the synthesis of new cells, including erythrocytes.
 Erythrocytes live up to 120 days in the circulation, after which the worn-out cells are removed by a type of myeloid

phagocytic cell called a macrophage, located primarily within the bone marrow, liver, and spleen. The components of the
degraded erythrocytesâ€™ hemoglobin are further processed as follows:

* Globin, the protein portion of hemoglobin, is broken down into amino acids, which can be sent back to the bone
marrow to be used in the production of new erythrocytes.
