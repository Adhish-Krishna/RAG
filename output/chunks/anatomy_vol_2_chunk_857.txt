In determining oxygenation of tissues, the value of greatest interest

the percentage of hemoglobin sites occupied by oxygen in a patient’s blood.

of the body, typically the tip of the patient’s finger. The device works by sending two different wavelengths of light (one

red, the other infrared) through the finger and measuring the light with a
light differentially depending upon its saturation with oxygen. The machi
