In 1970, a physician and researcher named Raymond Damadian noticed that malignant (cancerous) tissue gave
off different signals than normal body tissue. He applied for a patent for the first MRI scanning device, which was in use
clinically by the early 1980s. The early MRI scanners were crude, but advances in digital computing and electronics led
to their advancement over any other technique for precise imaging, especially to discover tumors. MRI also has the major
advantage of not exposing patients to radiation.
 Drawbacks of MRI scans include their much higher cost, and patient discomfort with the procedure. The MRI scanner
subjects the patient to such powerful electromagnets that the scan room must be shielded. The patient must be enclosed in
a metal tube-like device for the duration of the scan (see Figure 1.19b), sometimes as long as thirty minutes, which can
be uncomfortable and impractical for ill patients.
