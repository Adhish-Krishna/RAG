Watch this video  (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/
graymatter) to learn about the gray matter of the spinal cord
that receives input from fibers of the dorsal (posterior) root
and sends information out through the fibers of the ventral
(anterior) root. As discussed in this video, these connections
represent the interactions of the CNS with peripheral
structures for both sensory and motor functions. The cervical
and lumbar spinal cords have enlargements as a result of
larger populations of neurons. What are these enlargements
responsible for?

6. Compared with the nearest evolutionary relative, the
chimpanzee, the human has a brain that is huge. At a point
in the past, a common ancestor gave rise to the two species
of humans and chimpanzees. That evolutionary history is
long and is still an area of intense study. But something
happened to increase the size of the human brain relative
to the chimpanzee. Read this article
(http://openstaxcollege.org/V/hugebrain) in which the
author explores the current understanding of why this
happened.
