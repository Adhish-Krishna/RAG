Each of these components plays its
own unique role in terms of function.

 Membranes

The membrane that directly surrounds the heart and defines the pericardial cavity is called the pericardium or pericardial
sac. It also surrounds the “roots” of the major vessels, or the areas of closest proximity to the heart. The pericardium, which
literally translates as “around the heart,” consists of two distinct sublayers: the sturdy outer fibrous pericardium and the
inner serous pericardium. The fibrous pericardium is made of tough, dense connective tissue that protects the heart and
maintains its position in the thorax. The more delicate serous pericardium consists of two layers: the parietal pericardium,
which is fused to the fibrous pericardium, and an inner visceral pericardium, or epicardium, which is fused to the heart
and is part of the heart wall.
