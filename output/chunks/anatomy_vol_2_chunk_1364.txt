The earlier fragments of the cascade also have important functions. Phagocytic cells such as macrophages and
neutrophils are attracted to an infection site by chemotactic attraction to smaller complement fragments. Additionally, once
they arrive, their receptors for surface-bound C3b opsonize the pathogen for phagocytosis and destruction.

 Inflammatory Response

The hallmark of the innate immune response is inflammation. Inflammation is something everyone has experienced. Stub a
toe, cut a finger, or do any activity that causes tissue damage and inflammation will result, with its four characteristics: heat,
redness, pain, and swelling (“loss of function” is sometimes mentioned as a fifth characteristic). It is important to note that
inflammation does not have to be initiated by an infection, but can also be caused by tissue injuries. The release of damaged
cellular contents into the site of injury is enough to stimulate the response, even in the absence of breaks in physical barriers
that would allow pathogens to enter (by hitting your thumb with a hammer, for example).
