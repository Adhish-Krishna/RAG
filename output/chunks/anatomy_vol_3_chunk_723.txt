Its average size is
approximately 5 cm wide by 7 cm long (approximately 2 in by 3 in) when a female is not pregnant. It has three sections.
 The portion of the uterus superior to the opening of the uterine tubes is called the fundus. The middle section of the uterus
is called the body of uterus (or corpus). The cervix is the narrow inferior portion of the uterus that projects into the vagina.
 The cervix produces mucus secretions that become thin and stringy under the influence of high systemic plasma estrogen
concentrations, and these secretions can facilitate sperm movement through the reproductive tract.

 Several ligaments maintain the position of the uterus within the abdominopelvic cavity. The broad ligament is a fold of
peritoneum that serves as a primary support for the uterus, extending laterally from both sides of the uterus and attaching it
to the pelvic wall.
