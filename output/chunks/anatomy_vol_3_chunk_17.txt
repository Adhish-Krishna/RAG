Portions of the respiratory system are
also used for non-vital functions, such as sensing odors, speech production, and for straining, such as during childbirth or
coughing (Figure 22.2).

Figure 22.2 Major Respiratory Structures The major respiratory structures span the nasal cavity to the diaphragm.

 Functionally, the respiratory system can be divided into a conducting zone and a respiratory zone. The conducting
zone of the respiratory system includes the organs and structures not directly involved in gas exchange. The gas exchange
occurs in the respiratory zone.

 Conducting Zone

 The major functions of the conducting zone are to provide a route for incoming and outgoing air, remove debris and
pathogens from the incoming air, and warm and humidify the incoming air.
