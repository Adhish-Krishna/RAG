Excursion

Excursion is the side to side movement of the mandible. Lateral excursion moves the mandible away from the midline,
toward either the right or left side. Medial excursion returns the mandible to its resting position at the midline.

 Superior Rotation and Inferior Rotation

Superior and inferior rotation are movements of the scapula and are defined by the direction of movement of the glenoid
cavity. These motions involve rotation of the scapula around a point inferior to the scapular spine and are produced by
combinations of muscles acting on the scapula. During superior rotation, the glenoid cavity moves upward as the medial
end of the scapular spine moves downward. This is a very important motion that contributes to upper limb abduction.
 Without superior rotation of the scapula, the greater tubercle of the humerus would hit the acromion of the scapula, thus
preventing any abduction of the arm above shoulder height.
