This radiograph shows the position of the bones within the hand. Note the carpal
bones that form the base of the hand. (credit: modification of work by Trace Meek)

In the articulated hand, the carpal bones form a U-shaped grouping. A strong ligament called the flexor retinaculum
spans the top of this U-shaped area to maintain this grouping of the carpal bones. The flexor retinaculum is attached laterally
to the trapezium and scaphoid bones, and medially to the hamate and pisiform bones. Together, the carpal bones and the
flexor retinaculum form a passageway called the carpal tunnel, with the carpal bones forming the walls and floor, and the
flexor retinaculum forming the roof of this space (Figure 8.9). The tendons of nine muscles of the anterior forearm and
an important nerve pass through this narrow tunnel to enter the hand. Overuse of the muscle tendons or wrist injury can
produce inflammation and swelling within this space.
