Salts are compounds that,
when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions other than H* orOH . In contrast, acids release Hin solution, making it more
acidic. Bases accept H", thereby making the solution more alkaline (caustic).

 The pH of any solution is its relative concentration of H*. A solution with pH 7 is neutral. Solutions with pH below 7
are acids, and solutions with pH above 7 are bases. A change in a single digit on the pH scale (e.g., from 7 to 8) represents

a ten-fold increase or decrease in the concentration of H‚Äù. In a healthy adult, the pH of blood ranges from 7.35 to 7.45.
 Homeostatic control mechanisms important for keeping blood in a healthy pH range include chemicals called buffers, weak
acids and weak bases released when the pH of blood or other body fluids fluctuates in either direction outside of this normal
range.
