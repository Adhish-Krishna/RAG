Abduction and adduction movements are seen at
condyloid, saddle, and ball-and-socket joints (see Figure 9.12e).

 Circumduction

Circumduction is the movement of a body region in a circular manner, in which one end of the body region being moved
stays relatively stationary while the other end describes a circle. It involves the sequential combination of flexion, adduction,
extension, and abduction at a joint. This type of motion is found at biaxial condyloid and saddle joints, and at multiaxial
ball-and-sockets joints (see Figure 9.12e).

 Rotation

Rotation can occur within the vertebral column, at a pivot joint, or at a ball-and-socket joint. Rotation of the neck or body is
the twisting movement produced by the summation of the small rotational movements available between adjacent vertebrae.
 At a pivot joint, one bone rotates in relation to another bone. This is a uniaxial joint, and thus rotation is the only motion
allowed at a pivot joint.
