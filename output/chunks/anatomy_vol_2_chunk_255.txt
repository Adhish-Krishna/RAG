For example, the enteric plexus is the extensive network of axons
and neurons in the wall of the small and large intestines. The enteric plexus is actually part of the enteric nervous system,
along with the gastric plexuses and the esophageal plexus. Though the enteric nervous system receives input originating
from central neurons of the autonomic nervous system, it does not require CNS input to function. In fact, it operates
independently to regulate the digestive system.

 Nerves

Bundles of axons in the PNS are referred to as nerves. These structures in the periphery are different than the central
counterpart, called a tract. Nerves are composed of more than just nervous tissue. They have connective tissues invested
in their structure, as well as blood vessels supplying the tissues with nourishment. The outer surface of a nerve is a
surrounding layer of fibrous connective tissue called the epineurium. Within the nerve, axons are further bundled into
fascicles, which are each surrounded by their own layer of fibrous connective tissue called perineurium.
