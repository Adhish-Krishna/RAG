The expanded distal end consists of three articulating
surfaces: the medial and lateral condyles, and the patellar surface. The outside margins of the condyles are the medial and
ateral epicondyles. The adductor tubercle is on the superior aspect of the medial epicondyle.

 The patella is a sesamoid bone located within a muscle tendon. It articulates with the patellar surface on the anterior
side of the distal femur, thereby protecting the muscle tendon from rubbing against the femur.

 The leg contains the large tibia on the medial side and the slender fibula on the lateral side. The tibia bears the weight
of the body, whereas the fibula does not bear weight. The interosseous border of each bone is the attachment site for the
interosseous membrane of the leg, the connective tissue sheet that unites the tibia and fibula.

 The proximal tibia consists of the expanded medial and lateral condyles, which articulate with the medial and lateral
condyles of the femur to form the knee joint.
