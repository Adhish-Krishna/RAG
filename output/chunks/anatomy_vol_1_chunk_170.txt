But as more and more people
get up to dance—especially if the music is fast—collisions are likely to occur. It is the same with chemical reactions: the
more particles present within a given space, the more likely those particles are to bump into one another. This means that
chemists can speed up chemical reactions not only by increasing the concentration of particles—the number of particles
in the space—but also by decreasing the volume of the space, which would correspondingly increase the pressure. If there
were 100 dancers in that club, and the manager abruptly moved the party to a room half the size, the concentration of the
dancers would double in the new space, and the likelihood of collisions would increase accordingly.

 Enzymes and Other Catalysts

For two chemicals in nature to react with each other they first have to come into contact, and this occurs through random
collisions.
