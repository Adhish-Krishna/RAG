As the cardiogenic cords develop, a lumen
rapidly develops within them. At this point, they are referred to as endocardial tubes. The two tubes migrate together and
fuse to form a single primitive heart tube. The primitive heart tube quickly forms five distinct regions. From head to tail,
these include the truncus arteriosus, bulbus cordis, primitive ventricle, primitive atrium, and the sinus venosus. Initially, all

venous blood flows into the sinus venosus, and contractions propel the blood from tail to head, or from the sinus venosus to
the truncus arteriosus. This is a very different pattern from that of an adult.
