CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 803

bundle branch has two fascicles. The left bundle branch supplies the left ventricle, and the right bundle branch the right
ventricle. Since the left ventricle is much larger than the right, the left bundle branch is also considerably larger than the
right. Portions of the right bundle branch are found in the moderator band and supply the right papillary muscles. Because
of this connection, each papillary muscle receives the impulse at approximately the same time, so they begin to contract
simultaneously just prior to the remainder of the myocardial contractile cells of the ventricles. This is believed to allow
tension to develop on the chordae tendineae prior to right ventricular contraction. There is no corresponding moderator band
on the left. Both bundle branches descend and reach the apex of the heart where they connect with the Purkinje fibers (see
Figure 19.19, step 4).
