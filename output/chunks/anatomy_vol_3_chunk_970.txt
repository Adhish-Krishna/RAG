The talus bone thus transmits body weight posteriorly to the calcaneus and anteriorly through
the navicular, cuneiform, and cuboid bones, and metatarsals one through five. 41 A radiograph (X-ray image) of a child’s femur
will show the epiphyseal plates associated with each secondary ossification center. These plates of hyaline cartilage will appear
dark in comparison to the white imaging of the ossified bone. Since each epiphyseal plate appears and disappears at a different
age, the presence or absence of these plates can be used to give an approximate age for the child. For example, the epiphyseal plate
ocated at the base of the lesser trochanter of the femur appears at age 9-10 years and disappears at puberty (approximately 11
years of age). Thus, a child’s radiograph that shows the presence of the lesser trochanter epiphyseal plate indicates an approximate
age of 10 years. 42 Unlike other bones of the appendicular skeleton, the clavicle develops by the process of intramembranous
ossification.
