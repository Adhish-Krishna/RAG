The vascular spasm response is believed to be triggered by several chemicals called endothelins
that are released by vessel-lining cells and by pain receptors in response to vessel injury. This phenomenon typically lasts
for up to 30 minutes, although it can last for hours.

 Formation of the Platelet Plug

In the second step, platelets, which normally float free in the plasma, encounter the area of vessel rupture with the exposed
underlying connective tissue and collagenous fibers. The platelets begin to clump together, become spiked and sticky, and
bind to the exposed collagen and endothelial lining. This process is assisted by a glycoprotein in the blood plasma called

von Willebrand factor, which helps stabilize the growing platelet plug. As platelets collect, they simultaneously release
chemicals from their granules into the plasma that further contribute to hemostasis. Among the substances released by the
platelets are:
* adenosine diphosphate (ADP), which helps additional platelets to adhere to the injury site, reinforcing and expanding
the platelet plug
Â¢ serotonin, which maintains vasoconstriction
* prostaglandins and phospholipids, which also maintain vasoconstriction and help to activate further clotting chemicals,
as discussed next
A platelet plug can temporarily seal a small opening in a blood vessel.
