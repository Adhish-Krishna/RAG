Conversely, rotation of the limb so that the anterior surface moves away from the midline is lateral (external) rotation (see
Figure 9.12f). Be sure to distinguish medial and lateral rotation, which can only occur at the multiaxial shoulder and hip
joints, from circumduction, which can occur at either biaxial or multiaxial joints.

 Supination and Pronation

Supination and pronation are movements of the forearm. In the anatomical position, the upper limb is held next to the body
with the palm facing forward. This is the supinated position of the forearm. In this position, the radius and ulna are parallel
to each other. When the palm of the hand faces backward, the forearm is in the pronated position, and the radius and ulna
form an X-shape.

 Supination and pronation are the movements of the forearm that go between these two positions. Pronation is the
motion that moves the forearm from the supinated (anatomical) position to the pronated (palm backward) position.
