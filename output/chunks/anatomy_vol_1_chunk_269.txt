Figure 3.5 Simple Diffusion across the Cell (Plasma) Membrane The structure of the lipid bilayer allows only
small, non-polar substances such as oxygen and carbon dioxide to pass through the cell membrane, down their
concentration gradient, by simple diffusion.

 Solutes dissolved in water on either side of the cell membrane will tend to diffuse down their concentration gradients,
but because most substances cannot pass freely through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, their movement is restricted
to protein channels and specialized transport mechanisms in the membrane. Facilitated diffusion is the diffusion process
used for those substances that cannot cross the lipid bilayer due to their size and/or polarity (Figure 3.6). A common
example of facilitated diffusion is the movement of glucose into the cell, where it is used to make ATP.
