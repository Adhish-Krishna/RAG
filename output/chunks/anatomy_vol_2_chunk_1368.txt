When local infections are severe, neutrophils are
attracted to the sites of infections in large numbers, and as they phagocytose the pathogens and subsequently die, their
accumulated cellular remains are visible as pus at the infection site.

 Overall, inflammation is valuable for many reasons. Not only are the pathogens killed and debris removed, but the
increase in vascular permeability encourages the entry of clotting factors, the first step towards wound repair. Inflammation
also facilitates the transport of antigen to lymph nodes by dendritic cells for the development of the adaptive immune
response.
