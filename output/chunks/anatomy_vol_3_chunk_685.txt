The result of this increased blood flow to the penis and
reduced blood return from the penis is erection. Depending on the flaccid dimensions of a penis, it can increase in size
slightly or greatly during erection, with the average length of an erect penis measuring approximately 15 cm.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a condition in which a man has difficulty either initiating or maintaining an erection.
 The combined prevalence of minimal, moderate, and complete ED is approximately 40 percent in men at age 40, and
reaches nearly 70 percent by 70 years of age. In addition to aging, ED is associated with diabetes, vascular disease,
psychiatric disorders, prostate disorders, the use of some drugs such as certain antidepressants, and problems with the
testes resulting in low testosterone concentrations.
