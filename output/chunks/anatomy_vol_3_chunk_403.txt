However, the rate at which evaporation occurs depends on relative humidityâ€”more sweat evaporates in
lower humidity environments. Sweating is the primary means of cooling the body during exercise, whereas at rest, about 20
percent of the heat lost by the body occurs through evaporation.

 Metabolic Rate

The metabolic rate is the amount of energy consumed minus the amount of energy expended by the body. The basal
metabolic rate (BMR) describes the amount of daily energy expended by humans at rest, in a neutrally temperate
environment, while in the postabsorptive state. It measures how much energy the body needs for normal, basic, daily
activity. About 70 percent of all daily energy expenditure comes from the basic functions of the organs in the body.
 Another 20 percent comes from physical activity, and the remaining 10 percent is necessary for body thermoregulation or
temperature control. This rate will be higher if a person is more active or has more lean body mass.
