Figure 2.19 Three Important Disaccharides All three important disaccharides form by dehydration synthesis.

70 CHAPTER 2 | THE CHEMICAL LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/disaccharide) to observe the formation of a disaccharide. What
happens when water encounters a glycosidic bond?

Polysaccharides

Polysaccharides can contain a few to a thousand or more monosaccharides. Three are important to the body (Figure 2.20):

* Starches are polymers of glucose. They occur in long chains called amylose or branched chains called amylopectin,
both of which are stored in plant-based foods and are relatively easy to digest.
