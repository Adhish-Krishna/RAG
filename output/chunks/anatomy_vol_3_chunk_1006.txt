A tumor in the thoracic cavity may interrupt the output of the thoracic ganglia that project to
the head and face. 32 The heart—based on the resting heart rate—is under parasympathetic tone, and the blood vessels—based
on the lack of parasympathetic input—are under sympathetic tone. The vagus nerve contributes to the lowered resting heart rate,
whereas the vasomotor nerves maintain the slight constriction of systemic blood vessels. 33 Blood vessels, and therefore blood
pressure, are primarily influenced by only the sympathetic system. There is no parasympathetic influence on blood pressure, so
nicotine activation of autonomic ganglia will preferentially increase blood pressure. Also, cardiac muscle tissue is only modulated
by autonomic inputs, so the conflicting information from both sympathetic and parasympathetic postganglionic fibers will cause
arrhythmias. Both hypertension and arrhythmias are cardiac risk factors. 34 Drops of these substances into the eyes, as was once
done cosmetically, blocks the muscarinic receptors in the smooth muscle of the iris.
