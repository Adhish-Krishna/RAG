Coordinating that balance
requires integration that begins with forebrain structures like the hypothalamus and continues into the brain stem and spinal
cord.

 The Hypothalamus

The hypothalamus is the control center for many homeostatic mechanisms. It regulates both autonomic function and
endocrine function. The roles it plays in the pupillary reflexes demonstrates the importance of this control center. The optic
nerve projects primarily to the thalamus, which is the necessary relay to the occipital cortex for conscious visual perception.
 Another projection of the optic nerve, however, goes to the hypothalamus.

 The hypothalamus then uses this visual system input to drive the pupillary reflexes. If the retina is activated by high
levels of light, the hypothalamus stimulates the parasympathetic response. If the optic nerve message shows that low levels
of light are falling on the retina, the hypothalamus activates the sympathetic response. Output from the hypothalamus
follows two main tracts, the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus and the medial forebrain bundle (Figure 15.11).
