Temporomandibular joint disorders can
also cause headache, difficulty chewing, or even the inability to move the jaw (lock jaw). Pharmacologic agents for pain or
other therapies, including bite guards, are used as treatments.

Figure 9.15 Temporomandibular Joint The temporomandibular joint is the articulation between the temporal bone
of the skull and the condyle of the mandible, with an articular disc located between these bones. During depression of
the mandible (opening of the mouth), the mandibular condyle moves both forward and hinges downward as it travels
from the mandibular fossa onto the articular tubercle.

 Shoulder Joint

The shoulder joint is called the glenohumeral joint. This is a ball-and-socket joint formed by the articulation between the
head of the humerus and the glenoid cavity of the scapula (Figure 9.16).
