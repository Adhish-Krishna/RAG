Osteoblasts, which do not divide, synthesize and secrete the collagen matrix and
calcium salts. As the secreted matrix surrounding the osteoblast calcifies, the osteoblast become trapped within it; as a
result, it changes in structure and becomes an osteocyte, the primary cell of mature bone and the most common type of
bone cell. Each osteocyte is located in a space called a lacuna and is surrounded by bone tissue. Osteocytes maintain the
mineral concentration of the matrix via the secretion of enzymes. Like osteoblasts, osteocytes lack mitotic activity. They can
communicate with each other and receive nutrients via long cytoplasmic processes that extend through canaliculi (singular
= canaliculus), channels within the bone matrix.

 If osteoblasts and osteocytes are incapable of mitosis, then how are they replenished when old ones die? The answer
lies in the properties of a third category of bone cellsâ€”the osteogenic cell. These osteogenic cells are undifferentiated with
high mitotic activity and they are the only bone cells that divide.
