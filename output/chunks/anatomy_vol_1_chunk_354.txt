The primary mechanism by which genes are
turned “on” or “off” is through transcription factors. A transcription factor is one of a class of proteins that bind to specific
genes on the DNA molecule and either promote or inhibit their transcription (Figure 3.35).

Figure 3.35 Transcription Factors Regulate Gene Expression While each body cell contains the organism's entire
genome, different cells regulate gene expression with the use of various transcription factors. Transcription factors are
proteins that affect the binding of RNA polymerase to a particular gene on the DNA molecule.
