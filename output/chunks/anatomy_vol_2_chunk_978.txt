While most ventricular filling occurs while the atria are relaxed, they do demonstrate a contractile phase and
actively pump blood into the ventricles just prior to ventricular contraction. The opening between the atrium and ventricle
is guarded by the tricuspid valve.

 Right Ventricle

The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium through the tricuspid valve. Each flap of the valve is attached
to strong strands of connective tissue, the chordae tendineae, literally “tendinous cords,” or sometimes more poetically
referred to as “heart strings.” There are several chordae tendineae associated with each of the flaps. They are composed of
approximately 80 percent collagenous fibers with the remainder consisting of elastic fibers and endothelium. They connect
each of the flaps to a papillary muscle that extends from the inferior ventricular surface. There are three papillary muscles
in the right ventricle, called the anterior, posterior, and septal muscles, which correspond to the three sections of the valves.
