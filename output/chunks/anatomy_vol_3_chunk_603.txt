ADH also causes the epithelial cells that line
the renal collecting tubules to move water channel proteins, called aquaporins, from the interior of the cells to the apical
surface, where these proteins are inserted into the cell membrane (Figure 26.12). The result is an increase in the water
permeability of these cells and, thus, a large increase in water passage from the urine through the walls of the collecting
tubules, leading to more reabsorption of water into the bloodstream. When the blood plasma becomes less concentrated and
the level of ADH decreases, aquaporins are removed from collecting tubule cell membranes, and the passage of water out
of urine and into the blood decreases.
