(b) In
the electron cloud model, the electrons of carbon are shown in the variety of locations they would have at different
distances from the nucleus over time.

 An atom’s protons and electrons carry electrical charges. Protons, with their positive charge, are designated p”.

Electrons, which have a negative charge, are designated e . An atom’s neutrons have no charge: they are electrically neutral.
 Just as a magnet sticks to a steel refrigerator because their opposite charges attract, the positively charged protons attract the
negatively charged electrons. This mutual attraction gives the atom some structural stability. The attraction by the positively
charged nucleus helps keep electrons from straying far. The number of protons and electrons within a neutral atom are equal,
thus, the atom’s overall charge is balanced.

 Atomic Number and Mass Number

An atom of carbon is unique to carbon, but a proton of carbon is not.
