Interferons are an example of early induced proteins. Cells infected with viruses secrete
interferons that travel to adjacent cells and induce them to make antiviral proteins. Thus, even though the initial cell is
sacrificed, the surrounding cells are protected. Other early induced proteins specific for bacterial cell wall components are
mannose-binding protein and C-reactive protein, made in the liver, which bind specifically to polysaccharide components
of the bacterial cell wall. Phagocytes such as macrophages have receptors for these proteins, and they are thus able to
recognize them as they are bound to the bacteria. This brings the phagocyte and bacterium into close proximity and enhances
the phagocytosis of the bacterium by the process known as opsonization. Opsonization is the tagging of a pathogen for
phagocytosis by the binding of an antibody or an antimicrobial protein.

 Complement System

The complement system is a series of proteins constitutively found in the blood plasma. As such, these proteins are not
considered part of the early induced immune response, even though they share features with some of the antibacterial
proteins of this class.
