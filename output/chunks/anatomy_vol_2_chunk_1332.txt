Plasma Cells

Another type of lymphocyte of importance is the plasma cell. A plasma cell is a B cell that has differentiated in response
to antigen binding, and has thereby gained the ability to secrete soluble antibodies. These cells differ in morphology from
standard B and T cells in that they contain a large amount of cytoplasm packed with the protein-synthesizing machinery
known as rough endoplasmic reticulum.

Natural Killer Cells

A fourth important lymphocyte is the natural killer cell, a participant in the innate immune response. A natural killer
cell (NK) is a circulating blood cell that contains cytotoxic (cell-killing) granules in its extensive cytoplasm. It shares this
mechanism with the cytotoxic T cells of the adaptive immune response. NK cells are among the bodyâ€™s first lines of defense
against viruses and certain types of cancer.
