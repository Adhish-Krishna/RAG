Mechanical Digestion in the Small Intestine

The movement of intestinal smooth muscles includes both segmentation and a form of peristalsis called migrating motility
complexes. The kind of peristaltic mixing waves seen in the stomach are not observed here.

1050 CHAPTER 23 | THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM

 If you could see into the small intestine when it was going through segmentation, it would look as if the contents were
being shoved incrementally back and forth, as the rings of smooth muscle repeatedly contract and then relax. Segmentation
in the small intestine does not force chyme through the tract. Instead, it combines the chyme with digestive juices and
pushes food particles against the mucosa to be absorbed. The duodenum is where the most rapid segmentation occurs, at a
rate of about 12 times per minute. In the ileum, segmentations are only about eight times per minute (Figure 23.20).

 Figure 23.20 Segmentation Segmentation separates chyme and then pushes it back together, mixing it and
providing time for digestion and absorption.
