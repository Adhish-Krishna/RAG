The Role of Water in Chemical Reactions

Two types of chemical reactions involve the creation or the consumption of water: dehydration synthesis and hydrolysis.
 ¢ In dehydration synthesis, one reactant gives up an atom of hydrogen and another reactant gives up a hydroxyl group
(OH) in the synthesis of a new product. In the formation of their covalent bond, a molecule of water is released as a
byproduct (Figure 2.14). This is also sometimes referred to as a condensation reaction.
 ¢ In hydrolysis, a molecule of water disrupts a compound, breaking its bonds. The water is itself split into H and OH.
 One portion of the severed compound then bonds with the hydrogen atom, and the other portion bonds with the
hydroxyl group.

These reactions are reversible, and play an important role in the chemistry of organic compounds (which will be
discussed shortly).
