Eczema

Eczema is an allergic reaction that manifests as dry, itchy patches of skin that resemble rashes (Figure 5.21). It may be
accompanied by swelling of the skin, flaking, and in severe cases, bleeding. Many who suffer from eczema have antibodies
against dust mites in their blood, but the link between eczema and allergy to dust mites has not been proven. Symptoms are
usually managed with moisturizers, corticosteroid creams, and immunosuppressants.
