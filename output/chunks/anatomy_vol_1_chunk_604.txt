Figure 6.23 Graph Showing Relationship Between Age and Bone Mass Bone density peaks at about 30 years
of age. Women lose bone mass more rapidly than men.

 While osteoporosis can involve any bone, it most commonly affects the proximal ends of the femur, vertebrae,
and wrist. As a result of the loss of bone density, the osseous tissue may not provide adequate support for everyday
functions, and something as simple as a sneeze can cause a vertebral fracture. When an elderly person falls and breaks a
hip (really, the femur), it is very likely the femur that broke first, which resulted in the fall. Histologically, osteoporosis
is characterized by a reduction in the thickness of compact bone and the number and size of trabeculae in cancellous
bone.

 Figure 6.23 shows that women lose bone mass more quickly than men starting at about 50 years of age. This
occurs because 50 is the approximate age at which women go through menopause.
