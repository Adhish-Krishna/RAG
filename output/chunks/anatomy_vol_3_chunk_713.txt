As a result of these large follicles producing large amounts of estrogen, systemic
plasma estrogen concentrations increase. Following a classic negative feedback loop, the high concentrations of estrogen
will stimulate the hypothalamus and pituitary to reduce the production of GnRH, LH, and FSH. Because the large tertiary
ollicles require FSH to grow and survive at this point, this decline in FSH caused by negative feedback leads most of them
to die (atresia). Typically only one follicle, now called the dominant follicle, will survive this reduction in FSH, and this
ollicle will be the one that releases an oocyte. Scientists have studied many factors that lead to a particular follicle becoming
dominant: size, the number of granulosa cells, and the number of FSH receptors on those granulosa cells all contribute to a
ollicle becoming the one surviving dominant follicle.
