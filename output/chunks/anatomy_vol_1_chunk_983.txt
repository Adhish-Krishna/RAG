These movements allow you to flex or extend your body or limbs, medially rotate and
adduct your arms and flex your elbows to hold a heavy object against your chest, raise your arms above your head, rotate or
shake your head, and bend to touch the toes (with or without bending your knees).

 Each of the different structural types of synovial joints also allow for specific motions. The atlantoaxial pivot joint
provides side-to-side rotation of the head, while the proximal radioulnar articulation allows for rotation of the radius during
pronation and supination of the forearm. Hinge joints, such as at the knee and elbow, allow only for flexion and extension.
 Similarly, the hinge joint of the ankle only allows for dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of the foot.

 Condyloid and saddle joints are biaxial. These allow for flexion and extension, and abduction and adduction. The
sequential combination of flexion, adduction, extension, and abduction produces circumduction.
