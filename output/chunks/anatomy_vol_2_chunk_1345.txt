These nodules are located in the respiratory
and digestive tracts, areas routinely exposed to environmental pathogens.

 Tonsils are lymphoid nodules located along the inner surface of the pharynx and are important in developing immunity
to oral pathogens (Figure 21.10). The tonsil located at the back of the throat, the pharyngeal tonsil, is sometimes referred
to as the adenoid when swollen. Such swelling is an indication of an active immune response to infection. Histologically,
tonsils do not contain a complete capsule, and the epithelial layer invaginates deeply into the interior of the tonsil to form

tonsillar crypts. These structures, which accumulate all sorts of materials taken into the body through eating and breathing,
actually “encourage” pathogens to penetrate deep into the tonsillar tissues where they are acted upon by numerous lymphoid
follicles and eliminated.
