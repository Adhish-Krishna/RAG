The head and face are just lateral to the fingers as the gyrus approaches the lateral sulcus. The representation of the body
in this topographical map is medial to lateral from the lower to upper body. It is a continuation of the topographical
arrangement seen in the dorsal column system, where axons from the lower body are carried in the fasciculus gracilis,
whereas axons from the upper body are carried in the fasciculus cuneatus. As the dorsal column system continues into the
medial lemniscus, these relationships are maintained. Also, the head and neck axons running from the trigeminal nuclei to
the thalamus run adjacent to the upper body fibers. The connections through the thalamus maintain topography such that
the anatomic information is preserved. Note that this correspondence does not result in a perfectly miniature scale version
of the body, but rather exaggerates the more sensitive areas of the body, such as the fingers and lower face.
