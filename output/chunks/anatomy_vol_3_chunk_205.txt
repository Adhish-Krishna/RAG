Usually during swallowing, the soft palate and uvula rise reflexively to close off the entrance to the nasopharynx. At
the same time, the larynx is pulled superiorly and the cartilaginous epiglottis, its most superior structure, folds inferiorly,
covering the glottis (the opening to the larynx); this process effectively blocks access to the trachea and bronchi. When the
