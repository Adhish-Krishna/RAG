Screening for fecal occult blood tests and colonoscopy is
recommended for those over 50 years of age.

 Rectum

Food residue leaving the sigmoid colon enters the rectum in the pelvis, near the third sacral vertebra. The final 20.3 cm (8
in) of the alimentary canal, the rectum extends anterior to the sacrum and coccyx. Even though rectum is Latin for “straight,”
this structure follows the curved contour of the sacrum and has three lateral bends that create a trio of internal transverse
folds called the rectal valves. These valves help separate the feces from gas to prevent the simultaneous passage of feces
and gas.

 Anal Canal

Finally, food residue reaches the last part of the large intestine, the anal canal, which is located in the perineum, completely
outside of the abdominopelvic cavity. This 3.8-5 cm (1.5-2 in) long structure opens to the exterior of the body at the
anus.
