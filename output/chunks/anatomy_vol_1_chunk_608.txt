6.7 | Calcium Homeostasis: Interactions of the Skeletal
System and Other Organ Systems

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the effect of too much or too little calcium on the body
¢ Explain the process of calcium homeostasis

Calcium is not only the most abundant mineral in bone, it is also the most abundant mineral in the human body. Calcium
ions are needed not only for bone mineralization but for tooth health, regulation of the heart rate and strength of contraction,
blood coagulation, contraction of smooth and skeletal muscle cells, and regulation of nerve impulse conduction.
