After all, it has to protect the entire body from infection. Therefore, the
immune system is required to interact with other organ systems, sometimes in complex ways. Thirty years of research
focusing on the connections between the immune system, the central nervous system, and the endocrine system
have led to a new science with the unwieldy name of called psychoneuroimmunology. The physical connections
between these systems have been known for centuries: All primary and secondary organs are connected to sympathetic
nerves. What is more complex, though, is the interaction of neurotransmitters, hormones, cytokines, and other
soluble signaling molecules, and the mechanism of “crosstalk” between the systems. For example, white blood cells,
including lymphocytes and phagocytes, have receptors for various neurotransmitters released by associated neurons.
 Additionally, hormones such as cortisol (naturally produced by the adrenal cortex) and prednisone (synthetic) are well
known for their abilities to suppress T cell immune mechanisms, hence, their prominent use in medicine as long-term,
anti-inflammatory drugs.
