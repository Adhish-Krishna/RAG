Weeks 4-7

Respiratory development in the embryo begins around week 4. Ectodermal tissue from the anterior head region invaginates
posteriorly to form olfactory pits, which fuse with endodermal tissue of the developing pharynx. An olfactory pit is one
of a pair of structures that will enlarge to become the nasal cavity. At about this same time, the lung bud forms. The lung
bud is a dome-shaped structure composed of tissue that bulges from the foregut. The foregut is endoderm just inferior to
the pharyngeal pouches. The laryngotracheal bud is a structure that forms from the longitudinal extension of the lung bud
as development progresses. The portion of this structure nearest the pharynx becomes the trachea, whereas the distal end
becomes more bulbous, forming bronchial buds. A bronchial bud is one of a pair of structures that will eventually become
the bronchi and all other lower respiratory structures (Figure 22.29).
