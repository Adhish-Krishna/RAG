The five patients from LA, though, were between 29 and 36 years of age and should have been in the prime o
their lives, immunologically speaking. What could be going on?

A few days later, a cluster of eight cases was reported in New York City, also involving young patients, this time
exhibiting a rare form of skin cancer known as Kaposiâ€™s sarcoma. This cancer of the cells that line the blood and lymphatic
vessels was previously observed as a relatively innocuous disease of the elderly. The disease that doctors saw in 1981 was
frighteningly more severe, with multiple, fast-growing lesions that spread to all parts of the body, including the trunk and
face. Could the immune systems of these young patients have been compromised in some way? Indeed, when they were
tested, they exhibited extremely low numbers of a specific type of white blood cell in their bloodstreams, indicating that
they had somehow lost a major part of the immune system.
