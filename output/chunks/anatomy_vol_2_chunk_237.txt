Meningitis can be caused by infection by bacteria or viruses. The particular pathogens are not special to meningitis;
it is just an inflammation of that specific set of tissues from what might be a broader infection. Bacterial meningitis
can be caused by Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, or the tuberculosis pathogen, among many others. Viral meningitis is
usually the result of common enteroviruses (such as those that cause intestinal disorders), but may be the result of the
herpes virus or West Nile virus. Bacterial meningitis tends to be more severe.

 The symptoms associated with meningitis can be fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity, soreness of the
neck, or severe headache. More important are the neurological symptoms, such as changes in mental state (confusion,
memory deficits, and other dementia-type symptoms). A serious risk of meningitis can be damage to peripheral
structures because of the nerves that pass through the meninges.
