At the same
time, the cells of the brush border secrete enzymes such as aminopeptidase and dipeptidase, which further break down
peptide chains. This results in molecules small enough to enter the bloodstream (Figure 23.31).

1064 CHAPTER 23 | THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM

Protein digestion
begins in the
stomach by
hydrochloric
acid and the
enzyme pepsin

The liver regulates
distribution of
amino acids to the
rest of the body

Absorbed amino
acids enter the blood

and travel to the liver Protein-digesting

enzymes are
secreted from
the pancreas
into the small
intestine

The small
