Explain topographical representations of sensory information in at least two systems

Â¢ Describe two pathways of visual processing and the functions associated with each

Sensory Pathways

Specific regions of the CNS coordinate different somatic processes using sensory inputs and motor outputs of peripheral
nerves. A simple case is a reflex caused by a synapse between a dorsal sensory neuron axon and a motor neuron in the
ventral horn. More complex arrangements are possible to integrate peripheral sensory information with higher processes.
 The important regions of the CNS that play a role in somatic processes can be separated into the spinal cord brain stem,
diencephalon, cerebral cortex, and subcortical structures.

 Spinal Cord and Brain Stem

A sensory pathway that carries peripheral sensations to the brain is referred to as an ascending pathway, or ascending
tract. The various sensory modalities each follow specific pathways through the CNS. Tactile and other somatosensory
stimuli activate receptors in the skin, muscles, tendons, and joints throughout the entire body.
