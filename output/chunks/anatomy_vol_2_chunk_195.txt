The temporal lobe is associated with primary auditory sensation, known as Brodmann’s areas 41 and 42 in the superior
temporal lobe. Because regions of the temporal lobe are part of the limbic system, memory is an important function
associated with that lobe. Memory is essentially a sensory function; memories are recalled sensations such as the smell o
Mom’s baking or the sound of a barking dog. Even memories of movement are really the memory of sensory feedback from
those movements, such as stretching muscles or the movement of the skin around a joint. Structures in the temporal lobe
are responsible for establishing long-term memory, but the ultimate location of those memories is usually in the region in
which the sensory perception was processed.

 The main sensation associated with the parietal lobe is somatosensation, meaning the general sensations associated
with the body. Posterior to the central sulcus is the postcentral gyrus, the primary somatosensory cortex, which is identified
as Brodmann’s areas 1, 2, and 3.
