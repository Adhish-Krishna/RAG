The floor of the cranial cavity increases in depth from front to back and is divided into three cranial fossae. The anterior
cranial fossa is located between the frontal bone and lesser wing of the sphenoid bone. A small area of the ethmoid bone,
consisting of the crista galli and cribriform plates, is located at the midline of this fossa. The middle cranial fossa extends
from the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone to the petrous ridge (petrous portion of temporal bone). The right and left sides
are separated at the midline by the sella turcica, which surrounds the shallow hypophyseal fossa. Openings through the skull
in the floor of the middle fossa include the optic canal and superior orbital fissure, which open into the posterior orbit, the
foramen rotundum, foramen ovale, and foramen spinosum, and the exit of the carotid canal with its underlying foramen
lacerum.
