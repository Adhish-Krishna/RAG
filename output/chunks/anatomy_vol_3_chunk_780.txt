When the first sperm fuses with the oocyte, the oocyte deploys two mechanisms to prevent polyspermy, which is

penetration by more than one sperm. This is critical because if more than one sperm were to fertilize the oocyte, the resulting
zygote would be a triploid organism with three sets of chromosomes. This is incompatible with life.
 The first mechanism is the fast block, which involves a near instantaneous change in sodium ion permeability upon
binding of the first sperm, depolarizing the oocyte plasma membrane and preventing the fusion of additional sperm cells.
 The fast block sets in almost immediately and lasts for about a minute, during which time an influx of calcium ions
ollowing sperm penetration triggers the second mechanism, the slow block. In this process, referred to as the cortical
reaction, cortical granules sitting immediately below the oocyte plasma membrane fuse with the membrane and release
zonal inhibiting proteins and mucopolysaccharides into the space between the plasma membrane and the zona pellucida.
