Sodium is actively exchanged for K* using ATP on the basal membrane. Most of the substances

transported by a symport mechanism on the apical membrane are transported by facilitated diffusion on the basal membrane.
 At least three ions, K*, Ca**, and Mg”, diffuse laterally between adjacent cell membranes (transcellular).

About 67 percent of the water, Na", and K* entering the nephron is reabsorbed in the PCT and returned to the
circulation.
