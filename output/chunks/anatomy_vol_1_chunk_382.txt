The next level of organization is the organ, where several types of tissues come together to form a working unit. Just as
knowing the structure and function of cells helps you in your study of tissues, knowledge of tissues will help you understand
how organs function. The epithelial and connective tissues are discussed in detail in this chapter. Muscle and nervous tissues
will be discussed only briefly in this chapter.
