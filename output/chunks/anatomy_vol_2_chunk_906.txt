As discussed earlier, an
insufficient number of platelets, called thrombocytopenia, typically results in the inability of blood to form clots. This can
lead to excessive bleeding, even from minor wounds.

 Another reason for failure of the blood to clot is the inadequate production of functional amounts of one or more
clotting factors. This is the case in the genetic disorder hemophilia, which is actually a group of related disorders, the

most common of which is hemophilia A, accounting for approximately 80 percent of cases. This disorder results in the
inability to synthesize sufficient quantities of factor VIII. Hemophilia B is the second most common form, accounting
for approximately 20 percent of cases. In this case, there is a deficiency of factor IX. Both of these defects are linked to
the X chromosome and are typically passed from a healthy (carrier) mother to her male offspring, since males are XY.
