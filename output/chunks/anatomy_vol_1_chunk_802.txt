The inferior margin of this space is formed by the arcuate line of the ilium, the ridge formed by the pronounced change
in curvature between the upper and lower portions of the ilium. The large, inverted U-shaped indentation located on the
posterior margin of the lower ilium is called the greater sciatic notch.

 Ischium

The ischium forms the posterolateral portion of the hip bone (see Figure 8.13). The large, roughened area of the inferior
schium is the ischial tuberosity. This serves as the attachment for the posterior thigh muscles and also carries the weight
of the body when sitting. You can feel the ischial tuberosity if you wiggle your pelvis against the seat of a chair. Projecting
superiorly and anteriorly from the ischial tuberosity is a narrow segment of bone called the ischial ramus. The slightly
curved posterior margin of the ischium above the ischial tuberosity is the lesser sciatic notch. The bony projection
separating the lesser sciatic notch and greater sciatic notch is the ischial spine.
