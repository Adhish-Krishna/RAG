Figure 20.10 Systemic Blood Pressure The graph shows the components of blood pressure throughout the blood
vessels, including systolic, diastolic, mean arterial, and pulse pressures.

 Pulse Pressure

As shown in Figure 20.10, the difference between the systolic pressure and the diastolic pressure is the pulse pressure. For
example, an individual with a systolic pressure of 120 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure of 80 mm Hg would have a pulse
pressure of 40 mmHg.

 Generally, a pulse pressure should be at least 25 percent of the systolic pressure. A pulse pressure below this level
is described as low or narrow. This may occur, for example, in patients with a low stroke volume, which may be seen in
congestive heart failure, stenosis of the aortic valve, or significant blood loss following trauma.
