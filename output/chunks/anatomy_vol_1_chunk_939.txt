The net result is a forward and downward motion of the condyle and mandibular depression. The
temporomandibular joint is supported by an extrinsic ligament that anchors the mandible to the skull. This ligament spans
the distance between the base of the skull and the lingula on the medial side of the mandibular ramus.

 Dislocation of the TMJ may occur when opening the mouth too wide (such as when taking a large bite) or following
a blow to the jaw, resulting in the mandibular condyle moving beyond (anterior to) the articular tubercle. In this case, the
individual would not be able to close his or her mouth. Temporomandibular joint disorder is a painful condition that may
arise due to arthritis, wearing of the articular cartilage covering the bony surfaces of the joint, muscle fatigue from overuse
or grinding of the teeth, damage to the articular disc within the joint, or jaw injury.
