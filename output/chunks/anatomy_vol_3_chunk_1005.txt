28 The postganglionic sympathetic fiber releases norepinephrine, whereas the postganglionic
parasympathetic fiber releases acetylcholine. Specific locations in the heart have adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors.
 Which receptors are bound is the signal that determines how the heart responds. 29 The nerves that carry sensory information
from the diaphragm enter the spinal cord in the cervical region where somatic sensory fibers from the shoulder and neck would
enter. The brain superimposes this experience onto the sensory homunculus where the somatic nerves are connected. 30 Within
the cardiovascular system, different aspects demonstrate variation in autonomic tone. Heart rate is under parasympathetic tone,
and blood pressure is under sympathetic tone. Pharmaceuticals that treat cardiovascular disorders may be more effective if they
work with the normal state of the autonomic system. Alternatively, some disorders may be exacerbated by autonomic deficits and
common therapies might not be as effective. 31 Pupillary dilation and sweating, two functions lost in Hornerâ€™s syndrome, are
caused by the sympathetic system.
