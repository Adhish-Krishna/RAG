X-linked recessive inheritance is much more common because females can be carriers of the disease yet still have
a normal phenotype. Diseases transmitted by X-linked recessive inheritance include color blindness, the blood-clotting

disorder hemophilia, and some forms of muscular dystrophy. For an example of X-linked recessive inheritance, consider
parents in which the mother is an unaffected carrier and the father is normal. None of the daughters would have the disease
because they receive a normal gene from their father. However, they have a 50 percent chance of receiving the disease gene
from their mother and becoming a carrier. In contrast, 50 percent of the sons would be affected (Figure 28.29).

 With X-linked recessive diseases, males either have the disease or are genotypically normalâ€”they cannot be carriers.
