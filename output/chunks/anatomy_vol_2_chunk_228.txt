Blood Supply to the Brain

A lack of oxygen to the CNS can be devastating, and the cardiovascular system has specific regulatory reflexes to ensure
that the blood supply is not interrupted. There are multiple routes for blood to get into the CNS, with specializations to
protect that blood supply and to maximize the ability of the brain to get an uninterrupted perfusion.

Arterial Supply

The major artery carrying recently oxygenated blood away from the heart is the aorta. The very first branches off the aorta
supply the heart with nutrients and oxygen. The next branches give rise to the common carotid arteries, which further
branch into the internal carotid arteries. The external carotid arteries supply blood to the tissues on the surface of the
cranium. The bases of the common carotids contain stretch receptors that immediately respond to the drop in blood pressure
upon standing.
