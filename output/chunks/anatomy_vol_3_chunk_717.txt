Instead of estrogen, the luteinized granulosa and theca cells of the
corpus luteum begin to produce large amounts of the sex steroid hormone progesterone, a hormone that is critical for the
establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. Progesterone triggers negative feedback at the hypothalamus and pituitary,
which keeps GnRH, LH, and FSH secretions low, so no new dominant follicles develop at this time.

 The post-ovulatory phase of progesterone secretion is known as the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle. If pregnancy does
not occur within 10 to 12 days, the corpus luteum will stop secreting progesterone and degrade into the corpus albicans, a
nonfunctional “whitish body” that will disintegrate in the ovary over a period of several months. During this time of reduced
progesterone secretion, FSH and LH are once again stimulated, and the follicular phase begins again with a new cohort of
early tertiary follicles beginning to grow and secrete estrogen.
