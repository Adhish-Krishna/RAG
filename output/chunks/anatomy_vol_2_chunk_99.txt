Thermoreceptors work on a similar principle. When the local tissue
temperature changes, the protein reacts by physically opening the channel.

 A voltage-gated channel is a channel that responds to changes in the electrical properties of the membrane in which
it is embedded. Normally, the inner portion of the membrane is at a negative voltage. When that voltage becomes less
negative, the channel begins to allow ions to cross the membrane (Figure 12.20).
