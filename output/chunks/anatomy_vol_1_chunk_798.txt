Thus, the immobility
of the pelvis provides a strong foundation for the upper body as it rests on top of the mobile lower limbs.

Figure 8.12 Pelvis The pelvic girdle is formed by a single hip bone. The hip bone attaches the lower limb to the axial
skeleton through its articulation with the sacrum. The right and left hip bones, plus the sacrum and the coccyx, together
form the pelvis.

 Hip Bone

The hip bone, or coxal bone, forms the pelvic girdle portion of the pelvis. The paired hip bones are the large, curved bones
that form the lateral and anterior aspects of the pelvis. Each adult hip bone is formed by three separate bones that fuse
together during the late teenage years. These bony components are the ilium, ischium, and pubis (Figure 8.13).
