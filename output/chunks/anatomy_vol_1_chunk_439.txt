CHAPTER 4| THE TISSUE LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION 157

4.6 | Tissue Injury and Aging

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Identify the cardinal signs of inflammation
¢ List the body’s response to tissue injury
¢ Explain the process of tissue repair
¢ Discuss the progressive impact of aging on tissue

¢ Describe cancerous mutations’ effect on tissue

Tissues of all types are vulnerable to injury and, inevitably, aging. In the former case, understanding how tissues respond
to damage can guide strategies to aid repair. In the latter case, understanding the impact of aging can help in the search for
ways to diminish its effects.

 Tissue Injury and Repair

Inflammation is the standard, initial response of the body to injury. Whether biological, chemical, physical, or radiation
burns, all injuries lead to the same sequence of physiological events.
