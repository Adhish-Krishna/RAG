When death of such cells is extensive
(as can occur in a stroke, which causes cell death in the brain), the system can fail. Because the body is an integrated whole,
failure of a body system can ultimately lead to the death of the organism.

 Reproduction is the formation of a new organism from parent organisms. In humans, reproduction is carried out by
the male and female reproductive systems. Because death will come to all complex organisms, without reproduction, the
line of organisms would end.
