Hyperkalemia, an elevated potassium blood level, also can impair the function of skeletal muscles, the nervous
system, and the heart. Hyperkalemia can result from increased dietary intake of potassium. In such a situation, potassium
from the blood ends up in the ECF in abnormally high concentrations. This can result in a partial depolarization (excitation)
of the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle fibers, neurons, and cardiac cells of the heart, and can also lead to an inability
of cells to repolarize. For the heart, this means that it won’t relax after a contraction, and will effectively “seize” and stop
pumping blood, which is fatal within minutes. Because of such effects on the nervous system, a person with hyperkalemia
may also exhibit mental confusion, numbness, and weakened respiratory muscles.

 Chloride

Chloride is the predominant extracellular anion. Chloride is a major contributor to the osmotic pressure gradient between
the ICF and ECF, and plays an important role in maintaining proper hydration.
