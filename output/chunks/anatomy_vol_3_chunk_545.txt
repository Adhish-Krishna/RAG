The lungs can rid the body of excess acid very

rapidly (seconds to minutes) through the conversion of HCO3 into COz, which is then exhaled. It is rapid but has limited
capacity in the face of a significant acid challenge. The kidneys can rid the body of both acid and base. The renal capacity

is large but slow (minutes to hours). The cells of the PCT actively secrete H” into the forming urine as Na” is reabsorbed.
 The body rids itself of excess H” and raises blood pH. In the collecting ducts, the apical surfaces of intercalated cells have
proton pumps that actively secrete H” into the luminal, forming urine to remove it from the body.

 As hydrogen ions are pumped into the forming urine, it is buffered by bicarbonate (HCO3 ), H2PO4 (dihydrogen

phosphate ion), or ammonia (forming NH4”, ammonium ion).
