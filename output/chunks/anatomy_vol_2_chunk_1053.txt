Sj is the sound created by the closing
of the atrioventricular valves during ventricular contraction and is normally described as a “lub,” or first heart sound. The
second heart sound, S2, is the sound of the closing of the semilunar valves during ventricular diastole and is described as
a “dub” (Figure 19.29). In both cases, as the valves close, the openings within the atrioventricular septum guarded by the
valves will become reduced, and blood flow through the opening will become more turbulent until the valves are fully
closed. There is a third heart sound, S3, but it is rarely heard in healthy individuals. It may be the sound of blood flowing
into the atria, or blood sloshing back and forth in the ventricle, or even tensing of the chordae tendineae. S3 may be heard
in youth, some athletes, and pregnant women. If the sound is heard later in life, it may indicate congestive heart failure,
warranting further tests.
