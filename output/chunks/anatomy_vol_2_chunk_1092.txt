Cardiac Response to Increasing Blood Flow and Pressure Due to Increasing
Cardiac Output

Baroreceptors (aorta, carotid arteries,

venae cavae, and atria)

 Chemoreceptors (both central nervous
system and in proximity to

baroreceptors)
Sensitive Increasing stretch Increasing O2 and decreasing CO2, H’, and lactic
