Blood is composed of formed elements—erythrocytes, leukocytes, and cell fragments called platelets—and
a fluid extracellular matrix called plasma. More than 90 percent of plasma is water. The remainder is mostly plasma

proteins—mainly albumin, globulins, and fibrinogen—and other dissolved solutes such as glucose, lipids, electrolytes, and
dissolved gases. Because of the formed elements and the plasma proteins and other solutes, blood is sticky and more viscous
than water. It is also slightly alkaline, and its temperature is slightly higher than normal body temperature.

 18.2 Production of the Formed Elements

Through the process of hemopoiesis, the formed elements of blood are continually produced, replacing the relatively short-
ived erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets. Hemopoiesis begins in the red bone marrow, with hemopoietic stem cells that
differentiate into myeloid and lymphoid lineages. Myeloid stem cells give rise to most of the formed elements. Lymphoid
stem cells give rise only to the various lymphocytes designated as B and T cells, and NK cells.
