The malleus is attached to the tympanic membrane and articulates with the incus. The incus, in turn,
articulates with the stapes. The stapes is then attached to the inner ear, where the sound waves will be transduced into a
neural signal. The middle ear is connected to the pharynx through the Eustachian tube, which helps equilibrate air pressure
across the tympanic membrane. The tube is normally closed but will pop open when the muscles of the pharynx contract
during swallowing or yawning.
