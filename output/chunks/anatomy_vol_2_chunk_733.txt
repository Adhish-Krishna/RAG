The release of ACTH is regulated by the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus in response
to normal physiologic rhythms. A variety of stressors can also influence its release, and the role of ACTH in the stress
response is discussed later in this chapter.

 Follicle-Stimulating Hormone and Luteinizing Hormone

The endocrine glands secrete a variety of hormones that control the development and regulation of the reproductive system
(these glands include the anterior pituitary, the adrenal cortex, and the gonads—the testes in males and the ovaries in
emales). Much of the development of the reproductive system occurs during puberty and is marked by the development
of sex-specific characteristics in both male and female adolescents. Puberty is initiated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone
(GnRH), a hormone produced and secreted by the hypothalamus. GnRH stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete
gonadotropins—hormones that regulate the function of the gonads. The levels of GnRH are regulated through a negative
eedback loop; high levels of reproductive hormones inhibit the release of GnRH.
