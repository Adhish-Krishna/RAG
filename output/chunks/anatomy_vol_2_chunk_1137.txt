During sleep or rest periods, vessels in both areas are largely closed; they open only occasionally to allow
oxygen and nutrient supplies to travel to the tissues to maintain basic life processes.

Figure 20.6 Capillary Bed In a capillary bed, arterioles give rise to metarterioles. Precapillary sphincters located at
the junction of a metarteriole with a capillary regulate blood flow. A thoroughfare channel connects the metarteriole to
a venule. An arteriovenous anastomosis, which directly connects the arteriole with the venule, is shown at the bottom.

 Venules

A venule is an extremely small vein, generally 8-100 micrometers in diameter. Postcapillary venules join multiple
capillaries exiting from a capillary bed.
