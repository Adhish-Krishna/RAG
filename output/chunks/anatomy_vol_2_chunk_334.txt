Specific wavelengths of sound cause specific
regions of the basilar membrane to vibrate, much like the keys of a piano produce sound at different frequencies. Based
on the animation, where do frequencies—from high to low pitches—cause activity in the hair cells within the cochlear
duct?

Equilibrium (Balance)

Along with audition, the inner ear is responsible for encoding information about equilibrium, the sense of balance. A
similar mechanoreceptor—a hair cell with stereocilia—senses head position, head movement, and whether our bodies are
in motion. These cells are located within the vestibule of the inner ear. Head position is sensed by the utricle and saccule,
whereas head movement is sensed by the semicircular canals. The neural signals generated in the vestibular ganglion are
transmitted through the vestibulocochlear nerve to the brain stem and cerebellum.

 The utricle and saccule are both largely composed of macula tissue (plural = maculae). The macula is composed of hair
cells surrounded by support cells.
