It is an underlying concept in all of anatomy and physiology, but the
nervous system illustrates the concept very well.

 Fresh, unstained nervous tissue can be described as gray or white matter, and within those two types of tissue it can be
very hard to see any detail. However, as specific regions and structures have been described, they were related to specific

functions. Understanding these structures and the functions they perform requires a detailed description of the anatomy of
the nervous system, delving deep into what the central and peripheral structures are.

 The place to start this study of the nervous system is the beginning of the individual human life, within the womb. The
embryonic development of the nervous system allows for a simple framework on which progressively more complicated
structures can be built. With this framework in place, a thorough investigation of the nervous system is possible.
