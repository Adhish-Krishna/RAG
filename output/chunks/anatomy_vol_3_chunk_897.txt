For example, Down syndrome is caused by having three copies of chromosome 21. This is known as trisomy
21. The most common cause of trisomy 21 is chromosomal nondisjunction during meiosis. The frequency of nondisjunction
events appears to increase with age, so the frequency of bearing a child with Down syndrome increases in women over 36.
 The age of the father matters less because nondisjunction is much less likely to occur in a sperm than in an egg.

 Whereas Down syndrome is caused by having three copies of a chromosome, Turner syndrome is caused by having
just one copy of the X chromosome. This is known as monosomy. The affected child is always female. Women with Turner
syndrome are sterile because their sexual organs do not mature.

Given the intricate orchestration of gene expression, cell migration, and cell differentiation during prenatal
development, it is amazing that the vast majority of newborns are healthy and free of major birth defects.
