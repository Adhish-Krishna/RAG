 Functio

ns of the Cerebral Cortex

The cerebrum is the seat of many of the higher mental functions, such as memory and learning, language, and conscious
perception, which are the subjects of subtests of the mental status exam. The cerebral cortex is the thin layer of gray matter

on the outside of the cerebrum. It is approximately a millimeter thick in most regions and highly folded to fit within the
limited space of the cranial vault. These higher functions are distributed across various regions of the cortex, and specific
locations can be said to be responsible for particular functions. There is a limited set of regions, for example, that are

involved in
governs.
