The large and hydrophobic long-chain fatty acids and monoacylglycerides are not so easily suspended in the watery
intestinal chyme. However, bile salts and lecithin resolve this issue by enclosing them in a micelle, which is a tiny sphere
with polar (hydrophilic) ends facing the watery environment and hydrophobic tails turned to the interior, creating a receptive
environment for the long-chain fatty acids. The core also includes cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins. Without micelles,
lipids would sit on the surface of chyme and never come in contact with the absorptive surfaces of the epithelial cells.

Micelles can easily squeeze between microvilli and get very near the luminal cell surface. At this point, lipid substances
exit the micelle and are absorbed via simple diffusion.

 The free fatty acids and monoacylglycerides that enter the epithelial cells are reincorporated into triglycerides. The
triglycerides are mixed with phospholipids and cholesterol, and surrounded with a protein coat.
