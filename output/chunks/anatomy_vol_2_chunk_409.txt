The lumbar enlargement is not as significant in appearance because there is less fine motor control of the
lower limbs.

 Axial Control

The anterior corticospinal tract is responsible for controlling the muscles of the body trunk (see Figure 14.28). These
axons do not decussate in the medulla. Instead, they remain in an anterior position as they descend the brain stem and enter
the spinal cord. These axons then travel to the spinal cord level at which they synapse with a lower motor neuron. Upon
reaching the appropriate level, the axons decussate, entering the ventral horn on the opposite side of the spinal cord from
which they entered. In the ventral horn, these axons synapse with their corresponding lower motor neurons. The lower
motor neurons are located in the medial regions of the ventral horn, because they control the axial muscles of the trunk.

 Because movements of the body trunk involve both sides of the body, the anterior corticospinal tract is not entirely
contralateral.
