The major organs of the female reproductive system are located inside
the pelvic cavity.

 External Female Genitals

The external female reproductive structures are referred to collectively as the vulva (Figure 27.10). The mons pubis is a
pad of fat that is located at the anterior, over the pubic bone. After puberty, it becomes covered in pubic hair. The labia
majora (labia = “lips”; majora = “larger”) are folds of hair-covered skin that begin just posterior to the mons pubis. The
thinner and more pigmented labia minora (labia = “lips”; minora = “smaller”) extend medial to the labia majora. Although
they naturally vary in shape and size from woman to woman, the labia minora serve to protect the female urethra and the
entrance to the female reproductive tract.

 The superior, anterior portions of the labia minora come together to encircle the clitoris (or glans clitoris), an organ
that originates from the same cells as the glans penis and has abundant nerves that make it important in sexual sensation and
orgasm.
