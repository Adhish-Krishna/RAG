All of this takes place within approximately 2 milliseconds (Figure 12.24). While an action potential is in progress,
another one cannot be initiated. That effect is referred to as the refractory period. There are two phases of the refractory
period: the absolute refractory period and the relative refractory period. During the absolute phase, another action
potential will not start. This is because of the inactivation gate of the voltage-gated Na® channel. Once that channel is back
to its resting conformation (less than -55 mV), a new action potential could be started, but only by a stronger stimulus than
the one that initiated the current action potential. This is because of the flow of K” out of the cell. Because that ion is rushing

out, any Na’ that tries to enter will not depolarize the cell, but will only keep the cell from hyperpolarizing.
