Nervous tissue is different from other tissues in that it is not classified into separate tissue types. It does contain two
types of cells, neurons and glia, but it is all just nervous tissue. White matter and gray matter are not types of nervous tissue,
but indications of different specializations within the nervous tissue. However, not all nervous tissue performs the same
‘unction. Furthermore, specific functions are not wholly localized to individual brain structures in the way that other bodily
‘unctions occur strictly within specific organs. In the CNS, we must consider the connections between cells over broad
areas, not just the function of cells in one particular nucleus or region. In a broad sense, the nervous system is responsible
or the majority of electrochemical signaling in the body, but the use of those signals is different in various regions.

 The nervous system is made up of the brain and spinal cord as the central organs, and the ganglia and nerves as organs
in the periphery.
