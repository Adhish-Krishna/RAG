Discuss factors that can influence the respiratory rate

Pulmonary ventilation is the act of breathing, which can be described as the movement of air into and out of the lungs.
 The major mechanisms that drive pulmonary ventilation are atmospheric pressure (Patm); the air pressure within the alveoli,
called alveolar pressure (Paly); and the pressure within the pleural cavity, called intrapleural pressure (Pip).

 Mechanisms of Breathing

The alveolar and intrapleural pressures are dependent on certain physical features of the lung. However, the ability to
breathe—to have air enter the lungs during inspiration and air leave the lungs during expiration—is dependent on the air

 Pressure Relationships

Inspiration (or inhalation) and expiration (or exhalation) are dependent on the differences in pressure between tl
atmosphere and the lungs.
