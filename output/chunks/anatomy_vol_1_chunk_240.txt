Triglycerides are the most abundant lipid in the body, and are composed of a glycerol backbone attached to
three fatty acid chains. Phospholipids are compounds composed of a diglyceride with a phosphate group attached at the
molecule’s head. The result is a molecule with polar and nonpolar regions. Steroids are lipids formed of four hydrocarbon
rings. The most important is cholesterol. Prostaglandins are signaling molecules derived from unsaturated fatty acids.
 Proteins are critical components of all body tissues. They are made up of monomers called amino acids, which contain
nitrogen, joined by peptide bonds. Protein shape is critical to its function. Most body proteins are globular. An example is
enzymes, which catalyze chemical reactions.
 Nucleotides are compounds with three building blocks: one or more phosphate groups, a pentose sugar, and a nitrogen-
containing base. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids that function in protein synthesis. ATP is the body’s fundamental molecule
of energy transfer. Removal or addition of phosphates releases or invests energy.
