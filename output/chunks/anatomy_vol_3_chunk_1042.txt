As a result, the pressure within
the lungs drops below that of the atmosphere, causing air to rush into the lungs. In contrast, expiration is a passive process. As
the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, the lungs and thoracic tissues recoil, and the volume of the lungs decreases. This
causes the pressure within the lungs to increase above that of the atmosphere, causing air to leave the lungs. 43 Respiratory
rate is defined as the number of breaths taken per minute. Respiratory rate is controlled by the respiratory center, located in
the medulla oblongata. Conscious thought can alter the normal respiratory rate through control by skeletal muscle, although one
cannot consciously stop the rate altogether. A typical resting respiratory rate is about 14 breaths per minute. 44 Both Dalton’s and
Henry’s laws describe the behavior of gases. Dalton’s law states that any gas in a mixture of gases exerts force as if it were not ina
mixture.
