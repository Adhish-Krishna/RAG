Recent studies, however, have shown
that it is physiologically critical to such activities as helping to regulate capillary exchange and altering blood flow. The
endothelium releases local chemicals called endothelins that can constrict the smooth muscle within the walls of the vessel
to increase blood pressure. Uncompensated overproduction of endothelins may contribute to hypertension (high blood
pressure) and cardiovascular disease.
 ext to the endothelium is the basement membrane, or basal lamina, that effectively binds the endothelium to the
connective tissue. The basement membrane provides strength while maintaining flexibility, and it is permeable, allowing
materials to pass through it. The thin outer layer of the tunica intima contains a small amount of areolar connective tissue
that consists primarily of elastic fibers to provide the vessel with additional flexibility; it also contains some collagenous
fibers to provide additional strength.
