Hair is extremely sensitive to air movement or
other disturbances in the environment, much more so than the skin surface. This feature is also useful for the detection of
the presence of insects or other potentially damaging substances on the skin surface. Each hair root is connected to a smooth
muscle called the arrector pili that contracts in response to nerve signals from the sympathetic nervous system, making
the external hair shaft “stand up.” The primary purpose for this is to trap a layer of air to add insulation. This is visible in
humans as goose bumps and even more obvious in animals, such as when a frightened cat raises its fur. Of course, this is
much more obvious in organisms with a heavier coat than most humans, such as dogs and cats.

 Hair Growth

Hair grows and is eventually shed and replaced by new hair. This occurs in three phases. The first is the anagen phase,
during which cells divide rapidly at the root of the hair, pushing the hair shaft up and out.
