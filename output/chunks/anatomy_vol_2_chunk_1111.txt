After studying this chapter, you will be able to:

* Compare and contrast the anatomical structure of arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins

838 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION

* Accurately describe the forces that account for capillary exchange

* List the major factors affecting blood flow, blood pressure, and resistance

* Describe how blood flow, blood pressure, and resistance interrelate

* Discuss how the neural and endocrine mechanisms maintain homeostasis within the blood vessels
* Describe the interaction of the cardiovascular system with other body systems

* Label the major blood vessels of the pulmonary and systemic circulations

* Identify and describe the hepatic portal system

* Describe the development of blood vessels and fetal circulation

* Compare fetal circulation to that of an individual after birth

In this chapter, you will learn about the vascular part of the cardiovascular system, that is, the vessels that transport blood
throughout the body and provide the physical site where gases, nutrients, and other substances are exchanged with body
cells.
