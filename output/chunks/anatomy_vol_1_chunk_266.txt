gradient.) Diffusion is the movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.
 A couple of common examples will help to illustrate this concept. Imagine being inside a closed bathroom. If a bottle of
perfume were sprayed, the scent molecules would naturally diffuse from the spot where they left the bottle to all corners of
the bathroom, and this diffusion would go on until no more concentration gradient remains. Another example is a spoonful
of sugar placed in a cup of tea. Eventually the sugar will diffuse throughout the tea until no concentration gradient remains.
 In both cases, if the room is warmer or the tea hotter, diffusion occurs even faster as the molecules are bumping into each

other and spreading out faster than at cooler temperatures.
