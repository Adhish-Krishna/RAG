Physical pressure on the brain can cause the
loss of function, as well as the squeezing of local arteries resulting in compromised blood flow beyond the site of the
hemorrhage. As blood pools in the nervous tissue and the vasculature is damaged, the blood-brain barrier can break down
and allow additional fluid to accumulate in the region, which is known as edema.

Figure 16.3 Hemorrhagic Stroke (a) A hemorrhage into the tissue of the cerebrum results in a large accumulation
of blood (bottom arrow) with an additional edema in the adjacent tissue (top arrow). The hemorrhagic area causes the
entire brain to be disfigured as suggested here by the lateral ventricles being squeezed into the opposite hemisphere.
(b) A CT scan shows an intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the parietal lobe. (credit b: James Heilman)

CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 651

Whereas hemorrhagic stroke may involve bleeding into a large region of the CNS, such as into the deep white matter
of a cerebral hemisphere, other events can cause widespread damage and loss of neurological functions.
