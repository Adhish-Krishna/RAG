Figure 15.9 Autonomic Control of Pupillary Size Activation of the pupillary reflex comes from the amount of light
activating the retinal ganglion cells, as sent along the optic nerve. The output of the sympathetic system projects
through the superior cervical ganglion, whereas the parasympathetic system originates out of the midbrain and projects
through the oculomotor nerve to the ciliary ganglion, which then projects to the iris. The postganglionic fibers of
either division release neurotransmitters onto the smooth muscles of the iris to cause changes in the pupillary size.
 Norepinephrine results in dilation and ACh results in constriction.

 In this example, the autonomic system is controlling how much light hits the retina. It is a homeostatic reflex
mechanism that keeps the activation of photoreceptors within certain limits. In the context of avoiding a threat like the
lioness on the savannah, the sympathetic response for fight or flight will increase pupillary diameter so that more light
hits the retina and more visual information is available for running away.
