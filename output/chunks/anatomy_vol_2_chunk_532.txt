The role of visceral reflexes is to maintain a balance of function in the organ systems of the body. The two divisions
of the autonomic system each play a role in effecting change, usually in competing directions. The sympathetic system
increases heart rate, whereas the parasympathetic system decreases heart rate. The sympathetic system dilates the pupil of
the eye, whereas the parasympathetic system constricts the pupil. The competing inputs can contribute to the resting tone of
the organ system. Heart rate is normally under parasympathetic tone, whereas blood pressure is normally under sympathetic
tone. The heart rate is slowed by the autonomic system at rest, whereas blood vessels retain a slight constriction at rest.

 In a few systems of the body, the competing input from the two divisions is not the norm. The sympathetic tone of
blood vessels is caused by the lack of parasympathetic input to the systemic circulatory system. Only certain regions receive
parasympathetic input that relaxes the smooth muscle wall of the blood vessels.
