The atlas articulates with the dens from the axis.
 A typical thoracic vertebra is distinguished by its long, downward projecting spinous process. Thoracic vertebrae also have
articulation facets on the body and transverse processes for attachment of the ribs. Lumbar vertebrae support the greatest
amount of body weight and thus have a large, thick body. They also have a short, blunt spinous process. The sacrum is
triangular in shape. The median sacral crest is formed by the fused vertebral spinous processes and the lateral sacral crest
is derived from the fused transverse processes. Anterior (ventral) and posterior (dorsal) sacral foramina allow branches of
the sacral spinal nerves to exit the sacrum. The auricular surfaces are articulation sites on the lateral sacrum that anchor the
sacrum to the hipbones to form the pelvis. The coccyx is small and derived from the fusion of four small vertebrae.

 The intervertebral discs fill in the gaps between the bodies of adjacent vertebrae. They provide strong attachments
and padding between the vertebrae.
