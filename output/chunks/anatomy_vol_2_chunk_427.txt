In the
diencephalon, sensory pathways reach the thalamus. This is necessary for all sensory systems to reach the cerebral cortex,
except for the olfactory system that is directly connected to the frontal and temporal lobes.

 The two major tracts in the spinal cord, originating from sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia, are the dorsal
column system and the spinothalamic tract. The major differences between the two are in the type of information that is
relayed to the brain and where the tracts decussate. The dorsal column system primarily carries information about touch
and proprioception and crosses the midline in the medulla. The spinothalamic tract is primarily responsible for pain and
temperature sensation and crosses the midline in the spinal cord at the level at which it enters. The trigeminal nerve adds
similar sensation information from the head to these pathways.

 The auditory pathway passes through multiple nuclei in the brain stem in which additional information is extracted
from the basic frequency stimuli processed by the cochlea.
