Id. They also have little subcutaneous fat for insulation. All these factors make it harder for newborns to maintain their

ewborns, however, do have a special method for generating heat: nonshivering thermogenesis, which involves the

breakdown of brown adipose tissue, or brown fat, which is distributed over the back, chest, and shoulders. Brown fat
differs from the more familiar white fat in two ways:

t is highly vascularized. This allows for faster delivery of oxygen, which leads to faster cellular respiration.

 t is packed with a special type of mitochondria that are able to engage in cellular respiration reactions that produce
ess ATP and more heat than standard cellular respiration reactions.

 The breakdown of brown fat occurs automatically upon exposure to cold, so it is an important heat regulator in

newborns. During fetal development, the placenta secretes inhibitors that prevent metabolism of brown adipose fat and
promote its accumulation in preparation for birth.
