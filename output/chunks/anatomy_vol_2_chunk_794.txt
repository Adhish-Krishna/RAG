Thymus

The thymus is an organ of the immune system that is larger and more active during infancy and early childhood, and begins
to atrophy as we age. Its endocrine function is the production of a group of hormones called thymosins that contribute to
the development and differentiation of T lymphocytes, which are immune cells. Although the role of thymosins is not yet
well understood, it is clear that they contribute to the immune response. Thymosins have been found in tissues other than
the thymus and have a wide variety of functions, so the thymosins cannot be strictly categorized as thymic hormones.

 Liver

The liver is responsible for secreting at least four important hormones or hormone precursors: insulin-like growth factor
(somatomedin), angiotensinogen, thrombopoetin, and hepcidin. Insulin-like growth factor-1 is the immediate stimulus for
growth in the body, especially of the bones. Angiotensinogen is the precursor to angiotensin, mentioned earlier, which
increases blood pressure.
