Neurons display distinctive morphology, well suited to their role as conducting cells, with three main parts. The cell
body includes most of the cytoplasm, the organelles, and the nucleus. Dendrites branch off the cell body and appear as
thin extensions. A long “tail,” the axon, extends from the neuron body and can be wrapped in an insulating layer known

as myelin, which is formed by accessory ce
