The names of the nerves have changed over the years to reflect current usage and more accurate naming. An exercise
to help learn this sort of information is to generate a mnemonic using words that have personal significance. The names of
the cranial nerves are listed in Table 13.3 along with a brief description of their function, their source (sensory ganglion or
motor nucleus), and their target (sensory nucleus or skeletal muscle). They are listed here with a brief explanation of each
nerve (Figure 13.23).

 544 CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

The olfactory nerve and optic nerve are responsible for the sense of smell and vision, respectively. The oculomotor
nerve is responsible for eye movements by controlling four of the extraocular muscles. It is also responsible for lifting
the upper eyelid when the eyes point up, and for pupillary constriction. The trochlear nerve and the abducens nerve
are both responsible for eye movement, but do so by controlling different extraocular muscles.
