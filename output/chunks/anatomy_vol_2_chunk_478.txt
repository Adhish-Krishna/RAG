Figure 15.6 Comparison of Somatic and Visceral Reflexes The afferent inputs to somatic and visceral reflexes
are essentially the same, whereas the efferent branches are different. Somatic reflexes, for instance, involve a direct
connection from the ventral horn of the spinal cord to the skeletal muscle. Visceral reflexes involve a projection from
the central neuron to a ganglion, followed by a second projection from the ganglion to the target effector.

 Afferent Branch

The afferent branch of a reflex arc does differ between somatic and visceral reflexes in some instances. Many of the inputs
to visceral reflexes are from special or somatic senses, but particular senses are associated with the viscera that are not part
of the conscious perception of the environment through the somatic nervous system. For example, there is a specific type of
mechanoreceptor, called a baroreceptor, in the walls of the aorta and carotid sinuses that senses the stretch of those organs
when blood volume or pressure increases.
