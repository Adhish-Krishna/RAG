Finally, individual
axons are surrounded by loose connective tissue called the endoneurium (Figure 13.21). These three layers are similar to
the connective tissue sheaths for muscles. Nerves are associated with the region of the CNS to which they are connected,
either as cranial nerves connected to the brain or spinal nerves connected to the spinal cord.

outside, around each fascicle, and surrounding the individual nerve fibers (tissue source: simian).
