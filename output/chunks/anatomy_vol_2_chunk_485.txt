The sacral
component picks up with the majority of the large intestine and the pelvic organs of the urinary and reproductive systems.

 Short and Long Reflexes

Somatic reflexes involve sensory neurons that connect sensory receptors to the CNS and motor neurons that project back out
to the skeletal muscles. Visceral reflexes that involve the thoracolumbar or craniosacral systems share similar connections.
 However, there are reflexes that do not need to involve any CNS components. A long reflex has afferent branches that enter
the spinal cord or brain and involve the efferent branches, as previously explained. A short reflex is completely peripheral
and only involves the local integration of sensory input with motor output (Figure 15.8).
