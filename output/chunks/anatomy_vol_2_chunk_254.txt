Another group of autonomic ganglia are the terminal ganglia that receive input from cranial nerves or sacral spinal
nerves and are responsible for regulating the parasympathetic aspect of homeostatic mechanisms. These two sets of ganglia,
sympathetic and parasympathetic, often project to the same organs—one input from the chain ganglia and one input from
a terminal ganglion—to regulate the overall function of an organ. For example, the heart receives two inputs such as these;
one increases heart rate, and the other decreases it. The terminal ganglia that receive input from cranial nerves are found
in the head and neck, as well as the thoracic and upper abdominal cavities, whereas the terminal ganglia that receive sacral
input are in the lower abdominal and pelvic cavities.

 Terminal ganglia below the head and neck are often incorporated into the wall of the target organ as a plexus. A plexus,
in a general sense, is a network of fibers or vessels. This can apply to nervous tissue (as in this instance) or structures
containing blood vessels (such as a choroid plexus).
