Specific wavelengths of sound cause specific
regions of the basilar membrane to vibrate, much like the
keys of a piano produce sound at different frequencies.
 Based on the animation, where do frequencies—from high
to low pitches—cause activity in the hair cells within the
cochlear duct?

that depicts the visual pathway from the eye to the occipital
cortex. The first half of the pathway is the projection from
the RGCs through the optic nerve to the lateral geniculate
nucleus in the thalamus on either side. This first fiber in the
pathway synapses on a thalamic cell that then projects to the
visual cortex in the occipital lobe where “seeing,” or visual
perception, takes place.
