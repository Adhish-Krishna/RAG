Blood Volume

The relationship between blood volume, blood pressure, and blood flow is intuitively obvious. Water may merely trickle
along a creek bed in a dry season, but rush quickly and under great pressure after a heavy rain. Similarly, as blood volume
decreases, pressure and flow decrease. As blood volume increases, pressure and flow increase.

 Under normal circumstances, blood volume varies little. Low blood volume, called hypovolemia, may be caused by
bleeding, dehydration, vomiting, severe burns, or some medications used to treat hypertension. It is important to recognize
that other regulatory mechanisms in the body are so effective at maintaining blood pressure that an individual may be
asymptomatic until 10-20 percent of the blood volume has been lost. Treatment typically includes intravenous fluid
replacement.

 Hypervolemia, excessive fluid volume, may be caused by retention of water and sodium, as seen in patients with
heart failure, liver cirrhosis, some forms of kidney disease, hyperaldosteronism, and some glucocorticoid steroid treatments.
