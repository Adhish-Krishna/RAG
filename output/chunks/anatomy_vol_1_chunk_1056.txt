394 CHAPTER 10 | MUSCLE TISSUE

 There is a wide range of motor units within many skeletal muscles, which gives the nervous system a wide range of
control over the muscle. The small motor units in the muscle will have smaller, lower-threshold motor neurons that are
more excitable, firing first to their skeletal muscle fibers, which also tend to be the smallest. Activation of these smaller
motor units, results in a relatively small degree of contractile strength (tension) generated in the muscle. As more strength
is needed, larger motor units, with bigger, higher-threshold motor neurons are enlisted to activate larger muscle fibers. This
increasing activation of motor units produces an increase in muscle contraction known as recruitment. As more motor units
are recruited, the muscle contraction grows progressively stronger. In some muscles, the largest motor units may generate a
contractile force of 50 times more than the smallest motor units in the muscle.
