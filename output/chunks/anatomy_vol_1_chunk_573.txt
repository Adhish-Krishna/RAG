Still, most
doctors feel that the benefits of bisphosphonates more than outweigh the risk; the medical professional has to weigh
the benefits and risks on a case-by-case basis. Bisphosphonate treatment can reduce the overall risk of deformities or
fractures, which in turn reduces the risk of surgical repair and its associated risks and complications.

 Blood and Nerve Supply

The spongy bone and medullary cavity receive nourishment from arteries that pass through the compact bone. The arteries
enter through the nutrient foramen (plural = foramina), small openings in the diaphysis (Figure 6.15). The osteocytes in
spongy bone are nourished by blood vessels of the periosteum that penetrate spongy bone and blood that circulates in the
marrow cavities. As the blood passes through the marrow cavities, it is collected by veins, which then pass out of the bone
through the foramina.

 In addition to the blood vessels, nerves follow the same paths into the bone where they tend to concentrate in the more
metabolically active regions of the bone.
