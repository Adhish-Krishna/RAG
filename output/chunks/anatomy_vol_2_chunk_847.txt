These tests and procedures are often used to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of various severe
forms of anemia, such as thalassemia major and sickle cell anemia, as well as some types of cancer, specifically leukemia.

 In the past, when a bone marrow sample or transplant was necessary, the procedure would have required inserting
a large-bore needle into the region near the iliac crest of the pelvic bones (os coxae). This location was preferred, since
its location close to the body surface makes it more accessible, and it is relatively isolated from most vital organs.
 Unfortunately, the procedure is quite painful.

 Now, direct sampling of bone marrow can often be avoided. In many cases, stem cells can be isolated in just a few
hours from a sample of a patientâ€™s blood. The isolated stem cells are then grown in culture using the appropriate hemopoietic
growth factors, and analyzed or sometimes frozen for later use.
