COz in the blood readily reacts with water to form carbonic acid, and the levels of COz and carbonic
acid in the blood are in equilibrium. When the CO? level in the blood rises (as it does when you hold your breath), the excess
C02 reacts with water to form additional carbonic acid, lowering blood pH. Increasing the rate and/or depth of respiration
(which you might feel the “urge” to do after holding your breath) allows you to exhale more CO2. The loss of CO2 from the
body reduces blood levels of carbonic acid and thereby adjusts the pH upward, toward normal levels. As you might have
surmised, this process also works in the opposite direction. Excessive deep and rapid breathing (as in hyperventilation) rids
the blood of COz2 and reduces the level of carbonic acid, making the blood too alkaline. This brief alkalosis can be remedied
by rebreathing air that has been exhaled into a paper bag.
