Skeletal muscle is attached to bones and its contraction makes possible locomotion, facial expressions, posture, and
other voluntary movements of the body. Forty percent of your body mass is made up of skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscles
generate heat as a byproduct of their contraction and thus participate in thermal homeostasis. Shivering is an involuntary
contraction of skeletal muscles in response to perceived lower than normal body temperature. The muscle cell, or myocyte,
develops from myoblasts derived from the mesoderm. Myocytes and their numbers remain relatively constant throughout
life. Skeletal muscle tissue is arranged in bundles surrounded by connective tissue. Under the light microscope, muscle
cells appear striated with many nuclei squeezed along the membranes.
