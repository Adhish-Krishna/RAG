Angiotensin II is a systemic vasoconstrictor that helps to regulate blood pressure by increasing
it. Angiotensin II also stimulates the release of the steroid hormone aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone

stimulates Na* reabsorption by the kidney, which also results in water retention and increased blood pressure.
