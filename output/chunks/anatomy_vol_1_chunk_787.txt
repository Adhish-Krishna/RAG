Within the carpal bones, the four
proximal bones are united to each other by ligaments to form a unit. Only three of these bones, the scaphoid, lunate, and
triquetrum, contribute to the radiocarpal joint. The scaphoid and lunate bones articulate directly with the distal end of the
radius, whereas the triquetrum bone articulates with a fibrocartilaginous pad that spans the radius and styloid process of the
ulna. The distal end of the ulna thus does not directly articulate with any of the carpal bones.

 The four distal carpal bones are also held together as a group by ligaments. The proximal and distal rows of carpal
bones articulate with each other to form the midcarpal joint (see Figure 8.8). Together, the radiocarpal and midcarpal
joints are responsible for all movements of the hand at the wrist. The distal carpal bones also articulate with the metacarpal
bones of the hand.
