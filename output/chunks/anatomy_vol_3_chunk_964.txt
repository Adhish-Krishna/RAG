35 As you
push against the car, forces will pass from the metacarpal bones of your hand into the carpal bones at the base of your hand. Forces
will then pass through the midcarpal and radiocarpal joints into the radius and ulna bones of the forearm. These will pass the force
through the elbow joint into the humerus of the arm, and then through the glenohumeral joint into the scapula. The force will travel
through the acromioclavicular joint into the clavicle, and then through the sternoclavicular joint into the sternum, which is part
of the axial skeleton. 36 The base of the hand is formed by the eight carpal bones arranged in two rows (distal and proximal)
of four bones each. The proximal row contains (from lateral to medial) the scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, and pisiform bones. The
distal row contains (from medial to lateral) the hamate, capitate, trapezoid, and trapezium bones.
