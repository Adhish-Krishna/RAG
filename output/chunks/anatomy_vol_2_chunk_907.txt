Females would need to inherit a defective gene from each parent to manifest the disease, since they are XX. Patients with
hemophilia bleed from even minor internal and external wounds, and leak blood into joint spaces after exercise and into
urine and stool. Hemophilia C is a rare condition that is triggered by an autosomal (not sex) chromosome that renders
factor XI nonfunctional. It is not a true recessive condition, since even individuals with a single copy of the mutant gene
show a tendency to bleed. Regular infusions of clotting factors isolated from healthy donors can help prevent bleeding in
hemophiliac patients. At some point, genetic therapy will become a viable option.

 In contrast to the disorders characterized by coagulation failure is thrombocytosis, also mentioned earlier, a condition
characterized by excessive numbers of platelets that increases the risk for excessive clot formation, a condition known as
thrombosis.
