The adrenal glands produce the steroid hormone aldosterone, which is involved in
osmoregulation, and cortisol, which plays a role in metabolism.

 Like cholesterol, steroid hormones are not soluble in water (they are hydrophobic). Because blood is water-based,
lipid-derived hormones must travel to their target cell bound to a transport protein. This more complex structure extends
the half-life of steroid hormones much longer than that of hormones derived from amino acids. A hormone’s half-life is the
time required for half the concentration of the hormone to be degraded. For example, the lipid-derived hormone cortisol has
a half-life of approximately 60 to 90 minutes. In contrast, the amino acid—derived hormone epinephrine has a half-life of
approximately one minute.

 Pathways of Hormone Action

The message a hormone sends is received by a hormone receptor, a protein located either inside the cell or within the cell
membrane.
