PTH also increases the loss of
phosphate through the kidneys.

 Calcitonin is released from the thyroid gland in response to elevated blood levels of calcium. The hormone increases
the activity of osteoblasts, which remove calcium from the blood and incorporate calcium into the bony matrix.

 26.4 | Acid-Base Balance

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Identify the most powerful buffer system in the body
¢ Explain the way in which the respiratory system affects blood pH

Proper physiological functioning depends on a very tight balance between the concentrations of acids and bases in the blood.
 Acid-balance balance is measured using the pH scale, as shown in Figure 26.15. A variety of buffering systems permits
blood and other bodily fluids to maintain a narrow pH range, even in the face of perturbations. A buffer is a chemical system
that prevents a radical change in fluid pH by dampening the change in hydrogen ion concentrations in the case of excess
acid or base.
