The entire process
takes about 4 to 8 seconds for solid or semisolid food, and about 1 second for very soft food and liquids. Although this
sounds quick and effortless, deglutition is, in fact, a complex process that involves both the skeletal muscle of the tongue
and the muscles of the pharynx and esophagus. It is aided by the presence of mucus and saliva. There are three stages in
deglutition: the voluntary phase, the pharyngeal phase, and the esophageal phase (Figure 23.14). The autonomic nervous

system controls the latter two phases.
