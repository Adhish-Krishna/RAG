Other Inheritance Patterns: Incomplete Dominance, Codominance, and
Lethal Alleles

Not all genetic disorders are inherited in a dominant-recessive pattern. In incomplete dominance, the offspring express
a heterozygous phenotype that is intermediate between one parent’s homozygous dominant trait and the other parent’s
homozygous recessive trait. An example of this can be seen in snapdragons when red-flowered plants and white-flowered
plants are crossed to produce pink-flowered plants. In humans, incomplete dominance occurs with one of the genes for hair
texture. When one parent passes a curly hair allele (the incompletely dominant allele) and the other parent passes a straight-
hair allele, the effect on the offspring will be intermediate, resulting in hair that is wavy.

 Codominance is characterized by the equal, distinct, and simultaneous expression of both parents’ different alleles.
 This pattern differs from the intermediate, blended features seen in incomplete dominance.
