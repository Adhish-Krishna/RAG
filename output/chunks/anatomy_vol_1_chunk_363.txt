Cells also contain mitochondria and peroxisomes, which are the organelles responsible for producing the cell’s energy
supply and detoxifying certain chemicals, respectively. Biochemical reactions within mitochondria transform energy-
carrying molecules into the usable form of cellular energy known as ATP. Peroxisomes contain enzymes that transform

harmful substances such as free radicals into oxygen and water. Cell:

3.3 The Nucleus and DNA Replication

The nucleus is the command center of the cell, containing the genetic instructions for all of the materials a cell will make
(and thus all of its functions it can perform).
