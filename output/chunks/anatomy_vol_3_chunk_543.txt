When aldosterone causes a recovery of

Na’ in the nephron, a negative electrical gradient is created that promotes the secretion of K* and Cl into the lumen.

 Regulation of Cl

Chloride is important in acid-base balance in the extracellular space and has other functions, such as in the stomach, where
it combines with hydrogen ions in the stomach lumen to form hydrochloric acid, aiding digestion. Its close association with
Na’ in the extracellular environment makes it the dominant anion of this compartment, and its regulation closely mirrors
that of Na’.

 Regulation of Ca** and Phosphate

The parathyroid glands monitor and respond to circulating levels of Ca** in the blood. When levels drop too low, PTH
is released to stimulate the DCT to reabsorb Ca** from the forming urine. When levels are adequate or high, less PTH is
released and more Ca** remains in the forming urine to be lost.
