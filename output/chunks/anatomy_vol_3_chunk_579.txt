Fluid Compartments

Body fluids can be discussed in terms of their specific fluid compartment, a location that is largely separate from another
compartment by some form of a physical barrier. The intracellular fluid (ICF) compartment is the system that includes all
fluid enclosed in cells by their plasma membranes. Extracellular fluid (ECF) surrounds all cells in the body. Extracellular
fluid has two primary constituents: the fluid component of the blood (called plasma) and the interstitial fluid (IF) that
surrounds all cells not in the blood (Figure 26.3).
