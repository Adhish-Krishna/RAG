The wood of the applicator can be
snapped so that a pointed end is opposite the soft cotton-tipped end. The cotton end provides a touch stimulus, while the
pointed end provides a painful, or sharp, stimulus. While the patient’s eyes are closed, the examiner touches the two ends
of the applicator to the patient’s face, alternating randomly between them. The patient must identify whether the stimulus is
sharp or dull. These stimuli are processed by the trigeminal system separately. Contact with the cotton tip of the applicator
is a light touch, relayed by the chief nucleus, but contact with the pointed end of the applicator is a painful stimulus relayed
by the spinal trigeminal nucleus. Failure to discriminate these stimuli can localize problems within the brain stem. If a
patient cannot recognize a painful stimulus, that might indicate damage to the spinal trigeminal nucleus in the medulla. The
medulla also contains important regions that regulate the cardiovascular, respiratory, and digestive systems, as well as being
the pathway for ascending and descending tracts between the brain and spinal cord.
