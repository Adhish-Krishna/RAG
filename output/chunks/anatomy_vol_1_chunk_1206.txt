By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Identify the appendicular muscles of the pelvic girdle and lower limb
¢ Identify the movement and function of the pelvic girdle and lower limb

The appendicular muscles of the lower body position and stabilize the pelvic girdle, which serves as a foundation for the
lower limbs. Comparatively, there is much more movement at the pectoral girdle than at the pelvic girdle. There is very
little movement of the pelvic girdle because of its connection with the sacrum at the base of the axial skeleton. The pelvic
