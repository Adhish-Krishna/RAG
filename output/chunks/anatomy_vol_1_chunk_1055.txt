Small motor units permit very fine motor control of the muscle. The best example in humans is the small motor
units of the extraocular eye muscles that move the eyeballs. There are thousands of muscle fibers in each muscle, but every
six or so fibers are supplied by a single motor neuron, as the axons branch to form synaptic connections at their individual
NMgJs. This allows for exquisite control of eye movements so that both eyes can quickly focus on the same object. Small
motor units are also involved in the many fine movements of the fingers and thumb of the hand for grasping, texting, etc.

 A large motor unit is an arrangement where a single motor neuron supplies a large number of muscle fibers in a muscle.
 Large motor units are concerned with simple, or “gross,” movements, such as powerfully extending the knee joint. The best
example is the large motor units of the thigh muscles or back muscles, where a single motor neuron will supply thousands
of muscle fibers in a muscle, as its axon splits into thousands of branches.
