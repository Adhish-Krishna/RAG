Risk factors that may lead to osteoarthritis later in life include injury to a joint; jobs
that involve physical labor; sports with running, twisting, or throwing actions; and being overweight. These factors put
stress on the articular cartilage that covers the surfaces of bones at synovial joints, causing the cartilage to gradually
become thinner. As the articular cartilage layer wears down, more pressure is placed on the bones. The joint responds
by increasing production of the lubricating synovial fluid, but this can lead to swelling of the joint cavity, causing
pain and joint stiffness as the articular capsule is stretched. The bone tissue underlying the damaged articular cartilage
also responds by thickening, producing irregularities and causing the articulating surface of the bone to become rough
or bumpy. Joint movement then results in pain and inflammation. In its early stages, symptoms of osteoarthritis
may be reduced by mild activity that “warms up” the joint, but the symptoms may worsen following exercise.
