A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or disease. Such changes
can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization, and function.

 The Four Types of Tissues

Epithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body, lines
internal cavities and passageways, and forms certain glands. Connective tissue, as its name implies, binds the cells and
organs of the body together and functions in the protection, support, and integration of all parts of the body. Muscle
tissue is excitable, responding to stimulation and contracting to provide movement, and occurs as three major types:
skeletal (voluntary) muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle in the heart. Nervous tissue is also excitable, allowing the
propagation of electrochemical signals in the form of nerve impulses that communicate between different regions of the
body (Figure 4.2).
