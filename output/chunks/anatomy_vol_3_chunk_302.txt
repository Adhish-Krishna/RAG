Most water-soluble vitamins (including most B vitamins and vitamin C)
also are absorbed by simple diffusion. An exception is vitamin B12, which is a very large molecule. Intrinsic factor secreted

in the sto

mach binds to vitamin B12, preventing its digestion and creating a complex that binds to mucosal receptors in the

terminal ileum, where it is taken up by endocytosis.

 Water Absorption

Each day, about nine liters of fluid enter the small intestine. About 2.3 liters are ingested in foods and beverages, and the

rest is from GI secretions. About 90 percent of this water is absorbed in the small intestine. Water absorption is driven by
the concentration gradient of the water: The concentration of water is higher in chyme than it is in epithelial cells. Thus,
water moves down its concentration gradient from the chyme into cells. As noted earlier, much of the remaining water is
then absorbed in the colon.
