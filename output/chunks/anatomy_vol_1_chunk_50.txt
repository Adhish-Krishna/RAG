There are two types of reactions
that accomplish this: anabolism and catabolism
¢ Anabolism is the process whereby smaller, simpler molecules are combined into larger, more complex substances.
 Your body can assemble, by utilizing energy, the complex chemicals it needs by combining small molecules derived
from the foods you eat
¢ Catabolism is the process by which larger more complex substances are broken down into smaller simpler molecules.
 Catabolism releases energy. The complex molecules found in foods are broken down so the body can use their parts to
assemble the structures and substances needed for life.
Taken together, these two processes are called metabolism. Metabolism is the sum of all anabolic and catabolic
reactions that take place in the body (Figure 1.6). Both anabolism and catabolism occur simultaneously and continuously
to keep you alive.
