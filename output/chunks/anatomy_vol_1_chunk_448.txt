Radiation and
chemotherapy are difficult, and it is often impossible to target only the cancer cells. The treatments inevitably destroy
healthy tissue as well. To address this, researchers are working on pharmaceuticals that can target specific proteins
implicated in cancer-associated molecular pathways.

CHAPTER 4 | THE TISSUE LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION

KEY TERMS
adipocytes lipid storage cells
adipose tissue specialized areolar tissue rich in stored fat
anchoring junction mechanically attaches adjacent cells to each other or to the basement membrane
apical that part of a cell or tissue which, in general, faces an open space
apocrine secretion release of a substance along with the apical portion of the cell
apoptosis programmed cell death

areolar tissue (also, loose connective tissue) a type of connective tissue proper that shows little specialization with
cells dispersed in the matrix

astrocyte star-shaped cell in the central nervous system that regulates ions and uptake and/or breakdown of some
neurotransmitters and contributes to the formation of the blood-brain barrier

atrophy loss of mass and function
basal lamina thin extracellular layer that lies underneath epithelial cells and separates them from other tissues

basement membrane in epithelial tissue, a thin layer of fibrous material that anchors the epithelial tissue to the
underlying connective tissue; made up of the basal lamina and reticular lamina

cardiac muscle heart muscle, under involuntary control, composed of striated cells that attach to form fibers, each cell
contains a single nucleus, contracts autonomously

cell junction point of cell-to-cell contact that connects one cell to another in a tissue

chondrocytes cells of the cartilage

clotting also called coagulation; complex process by which blood components form a plug to stop bleeding
collagen fiber flexible fibrous proteins that give connective tissue tensile strength

connective tissue membrane connective tissue that encapsulates organs and lines movable joints

connective tissue proper connective tissue containing a viscous matrix, fibers, and cells.
