stimulation has three major effects:


28 CHAPTER 1| AN INTRODUCTION TO THE HUMAN BODY

* Blood vessels in the skin begin to dilate allowing more blood from the body core to flow to the surface of the skin
allowing the heat to radiate into the environment.

* As blood flow to the skin increases, sweat glands are activated to increase their output. As the sweat evaporates from
the skin surface into the surrounding air, it takes heat with it.

 * The depth of respiration increases, and a person may breathe through an open mouth instead of through the nasal
passageways. This further increases heat loss from the lungs.

 In contrast, activation of the brainâ€™s heat-gain center by exposure to cold reduces blood flow to the skin, and blood
returning from the limbs is diverted into a network of deep veins.
