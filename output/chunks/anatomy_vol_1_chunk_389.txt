Most epithelial tissues are essentially large sheets of cells covering all the surfaces of the body exposed to the outside world
and lining the outside of organs. Epithelium also forms much of the glandular tissue of the body. Skin is not the only area of
the body exposed to the outside. Other areas include the airways, the digestive tract, as well as the urinary and reproductive
systems, all of which are lined by an epithelium. Hollow organs and body cavities that do not connect to the exterior of the
body, which includes, blood vessels and serous membranes, are lined by endothelium (plural = endothelia), which is a type
of epithelium.
