Other
organs have smooth muscle or glandular tissue that is activated or inhibited by the autonomic system. Cardiac muscle is
intrinsically active and is modulated by the autonomic system. The contradictory signals do not just cancel each other out,
they alter the regularity of the heart rate and can cause arrhythmias. Both hypertension and arrhythmias are risk factors for
heart disease.

 Other drugs affect one division of the autonomic system or the other. The sympathetic system is affected by drugs that
mimic the actions of adrenergic molecules (norepinephrine and epinephrine) and are called sympathomimetic drugs. Drugs
such as phenylephrine bind to the adrenergic receptors and stimulate target organs just as sympathetic activity would. Other
drugs are sympatholytic because they block adrenergic activity and cancel the sympathetic influence on the target organ.
 Drugs that act on the parasympathetic system also work by either enhancing the postganglionic signal or blocking it. A
muscarinic agonist (or parasympathomimetic drug) acts just like ACh released by the parasympathetic postganglionic fiber.
