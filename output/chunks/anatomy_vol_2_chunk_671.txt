The patient eventually regained
his ability to remember, though the events in the hospital
were always elusive. Considering that the effects on memory
were temporary, but resulted in the loss of the specific events
of the hospital stay, what regions of the brain were likely
to have been affected by the antibodies and what type of
memory does that represent?

4. Watch the video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/2brains)
titled “The Man With Two Brains” to see the neuroscientist
Michael Gazzaniga introduce a patient he has worked with
for years who has had his corpus callosum cut, separating his
two cerebral hemispheres. A few tests are run to demonstrate
how this manifests in tests of cerebral function. Unlike
normal people, this patient can perform two independent
tasks at the same time because the lines of communication
between the right and left sides of his brain have been
removed.
