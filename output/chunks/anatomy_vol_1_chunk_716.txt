“nape” or “back of the neck”). The nuchal ligament is attached to the cervical spinous
processes and extends upward and posteriorly to attach to the midline base of the skull, out to the external occipital
protuberance. It supports the skull and prevents it from falling forward. This ligament is much larger and stronger in four-
legged animals such as cows, where the large skull hangs off the front end of the vertebral column. You can easily feel this
ligament by first extending your head backward and pressing down on the posterior midline of your neck. Then tilt your
head forward and you will fill the nuchal ligament popping out as it tightens to limit anterior bending of the head and neck.

 Additional ligaments are located inside the vertebral canal, next to the spinal cord, along the length of the vertebral
column. The posterior longitudinal ligament is found anterior to the spinal cord, where it is attached to the posterior sides
of the vertebral bodies.
