Figure 14.15 Structure of the Eye The sphere of the eye can be divided into anterior and posterior chambers. The
wall of the eye is composed of three layers: the fibrous tunic, vascular tunic, and neural tunic. Within the neural tunic is
the retina, with three layers of cells and two synaptic layers in between. The center of the retina has a small indentation
known as the fovea.

 Note that the photoreceptors in the retina (rods and cones) are located behind the axons, RGCs, bipolar cells, and retinal
blood vessels. A significant amount of light is absorbed by these structures before the light reaches the photoreceptor cells.
 However, at the exact center of the retina is a small area known as the fovea. At the fovea, the retina lacks the supporting
cells and blood vessels, and only contains photoreceptors. Therefore, visual acuity, or the sharpness of vision, is greatest at
the fovea.
