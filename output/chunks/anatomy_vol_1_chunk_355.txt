Over time, most adult
cells undergo the wear and tear of aging and lose their ability to divide and repair themselves. Stem cells do not display
a particular morphology or function. Adult stem cells, which exist as a small subset of cells in most tissues, keep
dividing and can differentiate into a number of specialized cells generally formed by that tissue. These cells enable the
body to renew and repair body tissues.

 The mechanisms that induce a non-differentiated cell to become a specialized cell are poorly understood. In a
laboratory setting, it is possible to induce stem cells to differentiate into specialized cells by changing the physical and
chemical conditions of growth. Several sources of stem cells are used experimentally and are classified according to
their origin and potential for differentiation. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are extracted from embryos and
are pluripotent. The adult stem cells that are present in many organs and differentiated tissues, such as bone marrow
and skin, are multipotent, being limited in differentiation to the types of cells found in those tissues.
