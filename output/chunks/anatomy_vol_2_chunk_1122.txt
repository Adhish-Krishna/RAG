n larger arteries, there is also a thick, distinct layer of elastic fibers known as the internal elastic membrane (also
called the internal elastic lamina) at the boundary with the tunica media. Like the other components of the tunica intima, the
internal elastic membrane provides structure while allowing the vessel to stretch. It is permeated with small openings that
allow exchange of materials between the tunics. The internal elastic membrane is not apparent in veins. In addition, many
veins, particularly in the lower limbs, contain valves formed by sections of thickened endothelium that are reinforced with
connective tissue, extending into the lumen.

 Under the microscope, the lumen and the entire tunica intima of a vein will appear smooth, whereas those of an artery
will normally appear wavy because of the partial constriction of the smooth muscle in the tunica media, the next layer of
blood vessel walls.
