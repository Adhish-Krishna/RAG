As we have seen, the depolarization and repolarization of an action potential are dependent on two types of channels
(the voltage-gated Na* channel and the voltage-gated K* channel). The voltage-gated Na® channel actually has two gates.
 One is the activation gate, which opens when the membrane potential crosses -55 mV. The other gate is the inactivation
gate, which closes after a specific period of time—on the order of a fraction of a millisecond. When a cell is at rest, the
activation gate is closed and the inactivation gate is open. However, when the threshold is reached, the activation gate opens,
allowing Na’ to rush into the cell. Timed with the peak of depolarization, the inactivation gate closes. During repolarization,
no more sodium can enter the cell. When the membrane potential passes -55 mV again, the activation gate closes. After
that, the inactivation gate re-opens, making the channel ready to start the whole process over again.
