These vessels could be in the periosteum, osteons,
and/or medullary cavity. The blood begins to clot, and about six to eight hours after the fracture, the clotting blood has
formed a fracture hematoma (Figure 6.21a). The disruption of blood flow to the bone results in the death of bone cells
around the fracture.

Figure 6.21 Stages in Fracture Repair The healing of a bone fracture follows a series of progressive steps: (a) A
fracture hematoma forms. (b) Internal and external calli form. (c) Cartilage of the calli is replaced by trabecular bone.
 (d) Remodeling occurs.

 Within about 48 hours after the fracture, chondrocytes from the endosteum have created an internal callus (plural =
calli) by secreting a fibrocartilaginous matrix between the two ends of the broken bone, while the periosteal chondrocytes
and osteoblasts create an external callus of hyaline cartilage and bone, respectively, around the outside of the break (Figure
6.21b).
