Examples of hormones that use cAMP as a second messenger include
calcitonin, which is important for bone construction and regulating blood calcium levels; glucagon, which plays a role in
blood glucose levels; and thyroid-stimulating hormone, which causes the release of T3 and T4 from the thyroid gland.

 Overall, the phosphorylation cascade significantly increases the efficiency, speed, and specificity of the hormonal
response, as thousands of signaling events can be initiated simultaneously in response to a very low concentration of
hormone in the bloodstream. However, the duration of the hormone signal is short, as cAMP is quickly deactivated by the
enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDE), which is located in the cytosol. The action of PDE helps to ensure that a target cellâ€™s
response ceases quickly unless new hormones arrive at the cell membrane.

 Importantly, there are also G proteins that decrease the levels of cAMP in the cell in response to hormone binding.
