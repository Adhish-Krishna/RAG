Patients with Addisonâ€™s disease may have low blood pressure, paleness, extreme weakness, fatigue, slow or
sluggish movements, lightheadedness, and salt cravings due to the loss of sodium and high blood potassium levels

(hyperkalemia). Victims also may suffer from loss of a

ppetite, chronic diarrhea, vomiting, mouth lesions, and patchy

skin color. Diagnosis typically involves blood tests and imaging tests of the adrenal and pituitary glands. Treatment
involves cortisol replacement therapy, which usually must be continued for life.

 Oxidation-Reduction Reactions

The chemical reactions underlying metabolism involve the transfer of electrons from one compound to another by processes
catalyzed by enzymes. The electrons in these reactions commonly come from hydrogen atoms, which consist of an electron

and a proton. A molecule gives up a hydrogen atom, in the form of a hydrogen ion (H*) and an electron, breaking the
molecule into smaller parts.
