CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 575

Vision

Vision is the special sense of sight that is based on the transduction of light stimuli received through the eyes. The eyes are
located within either orbit in the skull. The bony orbits surround the eyeballs, protecting them and anchoring the soft tissues
of the eye (Figure 14.13). The eyelids, with lashes at their leading edges, help to protect the eye from abrasions by blocking
particles that may land on the surface of the eye. The inner surface of each lid is a thin membrane known as the palpebral
conjunctiva. The conjunctiva extends over the white areas of the eye (the sclera), connecting the eyelids to the eyeball.
 Tears are produced by the lacrimal gland, located beneath the lateral edges of the nose. Tears produced by this gland flow
through the lacrimal duct to the medial corner of the eye, where the tears flow over the conjunctiva, washing away foreign
particles.
