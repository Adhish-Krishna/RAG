One major cause of age-related immune deficiencies is thymic
involution, the shrinking of the thymus gland that begins at birth, at a rate of about three percent tissue loss per year,
and continues until 35-45 years of age, when the rate declines to about one percent loss per year for the rest of oneâ€™s
life. At that pace, the total loss of thymic epithelial tissue and thymocytes would occur at about 120 years of age. Thus,
this age is a theoretical limit to a healthy human lifespan.

 Thymic involution has been observed in all vertebrate species that have a thymus gland. Animal studies have
shown that transplanted thymic grafts between inbred strains of mice involuted according to the age of the donor
and not of the recipient, implying the process is genetically programmed. There is evidence that the thymic
microenvironment, so vital to the development of naive T cells, loses thymic epithelial cells according to the decreasing
expression of the FOXN1 gene with age.
