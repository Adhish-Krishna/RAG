 True labor progresses in a positive feedback loop in which uterine contractions stretch the cervix, causing it to dilate
and efface, or become thinner. Cervical stretching induces reflexive uterine contractions that dilate and efface the cervix
further. In addition, cervical dilation boosts oxytocin secretion from the pituitary, which in turn triggers more powerful
uterine contractions. When labor begins, uterine contractions may occur only every 3-30 minutes and last only 20-40
seconds; however, by the end of this stage, contractions may occur as frequently as every 1.5-2 minutes and last for a full
minute.

 Each contraction sharply reduces oxygenated blood flow to the fetus. For this reason, it is critical that a period of
relaxation occur after each contraction. Fetal distress, measured as a sustained decrease or increase in the fetal heart rate,
can result from severe contractions that are too powerful or lengthy for oxygenated blood to be restored to the fetus.
