The C1 vertebra does not have a body or
spinous process. Instead, it is ring-shaped, consisting of an anterior arch and a posterior arch. The transverse processes of
the atlas are longer and extend more laterally than do the transverse processes of any other cervical vertebrae. The superior
articular processes face upward and are deeply curved for articulation with the occipital condyles on the base of the skull.
 The inferior articular processes are flat and face downward to join with the superior articular processes of the C2 vertebra.

 The second cervical (C2) vertebra is called the axis, because it serves as the axis for rotation when turning the head
toward the right or left. The axis resembles typical cervical vertebrae in most respects, but is easily distinguished by the
dens (odontoid process), a bony projection that extends upward from the vertebral body.
