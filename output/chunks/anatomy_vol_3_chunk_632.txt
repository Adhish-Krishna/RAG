A decrease of blood bicarbonate can result
from the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase by certain diuretics or from excessive bicarbonate loss due to diarrhea. Blood
bicarbonate levels are also typically lower in people who have Addison’s disease (chronic adrenal insufficiency), in which

aldosterone levels are reduced, and in people who have renal damage, such as chronic nephritis. Finally, low bicarbonate
blood levels can result from elevated levels of ketones (common in unmanaged diabetes mellitus), which bind bicarbonate
in the filtrate and prevent its conservation.

 Bicarbonate ions, HCO3’, found in the filtrate, are essential to the bicarbonate buffer system, yet the cells of the tubule
are not permeable to bicarbonate ions. The steps involved in supplying bicarbonate ions to the system are seen in Figure
26.17 and are summarized below:

* Step 1: Sodium ions are reabsorbed from the filtrate in exchange for H* by an antiport mechanism in the apical
membranes of cells lining the renal tubule.
