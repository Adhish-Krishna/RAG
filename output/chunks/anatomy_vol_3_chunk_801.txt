The yolk sac supplies some nutrients absorbed from
the trophoblast and also provides primitive blood circulation to the developing embryo for the second and third week of
development. When the placenta takes over nourishing the embryo at approximately week 4, the yolk sac has been greatly
reduced in size and its main function is to serve as the source of blood cells and germ cells (cells that will give rise to
gametes). During week 3, a finger-like outpocketing of the yolk sac develops into the allantois, a primitive excretory duct
of the embryo that will become part of the urinary bladder. Together, the stalks of the yolk sac and allantois establish the
outer structure of the umbilical cord.

 The last of the extra-embryonic membranes is the chorion, which is the one membrane that surrounds all others. The
development of the chorion will be discussed in more detail shortly, as it relates to the growth and development of the
placenta.
