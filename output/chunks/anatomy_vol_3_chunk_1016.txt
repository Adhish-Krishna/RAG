accumulate throughout the body, including in the kidney tubules, where they are referred to as kidney stones. 49 The outer region
is the zona glomerulosa, which produces mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone; the next region is the zona fasciculata, which
produces glucocorticoids such as cortisol; the inner region is the zona reticularis, which produces androgens. 50 Damage to the
innervation of the adrenal medulla would prevent the adrenal glands from responding to the hypothalamus during the fight-or-
flight response. Therefore, the response would be reduced. 51 The short-term stress response involves the hormones epinephrine
and norepinephrine, which work to increase the oxygen supply to organs important for extreme muscular action such as the
brain, lungs, and muscles.
