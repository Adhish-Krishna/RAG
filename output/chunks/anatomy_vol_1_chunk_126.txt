In the
planetary model, heliumâ€™s two electrons are shown circling the nucleus in a fixed orbit depicted as a ring. Although this
model is helpful in visualizing atomic structure, in reality, electrons do not travel in fixed orbits, but whiz around the nucleus
erratically in a so-called electron cloud.

Figure 2.3 Two Models of Atomic Structure (a) In the planetary model, the electrons of helium are shown in
fixed orbits, depicted as rings, at a precise distance from the nucleus, somewhat like planets orbiting the sun.
