However, it is not the only sugar that can produce a diuretic effect. In
cases of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, glucose levels exceed the capacity of the tubular glucose symporters, resulting
in glucose in the urine. The unrecovered glucose becomes a powerful osmotic diuretic. Classically, in the days before
glucose could be detected in the blood and urine, clinicians identified diabetes mellitus by the three Ps: polyuria (diuresis),
polydipsia (increased thirst), and polyphagia (increased hunger).

 Regulation of Extracellular Na*

Sodium has a very strong osmotic effect and attracts water. It plays a larger role in the osmolarity of the plasma than

any other circulating component of the blood. If there is too much Na‚Äù present, either due to poor control or excess
dietary consumption, a series of metabolic problems ensue. There is an increase in total volume of water, which leads to
hypertension (high blood pressure).
