This hormone decreases in late gestation, allowing uterine contractions to intensify and eventually
progress to true labor. The placenta also produces hCG. In addition to promoting survival of the corpus luteum, hCG
stimulates the male fetal gonads to secrete testosterone, which is essential for the development of the male reproductive
system.
 The anterior pituitary enlarges and ramps up its hormone production during pregnancy, raising the levels of thyrotropin,
prolactin, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Thyrotropin, in conjunction with placental hormones, increases the
production of thyroid hormone, which raises the maternal metabolic rate. This can markedly augment a pregnant womanâ€™s
appetite and cause hot flashes. Prolactin stimulates enlargement of the mammary glands in preparation for milk production.
 ACTH stimulates maternal cortisol secretion, which contributes to fetal protein synthesis. In addition to the pituitary
hormones, increased parathyroid levels mobilize calcium from maternal bones for fetal use.

The second and third trimesters of pregnancy are associated with dramatic changes in maternal anatomy and physiology.
