The extended refractory period allows the cell to fully contract before another electrical event can occur.

(b) The action potential for heart muscle is compared to that of skeletal muscle.

 Calcium lons

Calcium ions play two critical roles in the physiology of cardiac muscle. Their influx through slow calcium channels
accounts for the prolonged plateau phase and absolute refractory period that enable cardiac muscle to function properly.
 Calcium ions also combine with the regulatory protein troponin in the troponin-tropomyosin complex; this complex
removes the inhibition that prevents the heads of the myosin molecules from forming cross bridges with the active sites
on actin that provide the power stroke of contraction. This mechanism is virtually identical to that of skeletal muscle.
 Approximately 20 percent of the calcium required for contraction is supplied by the influx of Ca** during the plateau phase.

 The remaining Ca?* for contraction is released from storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
 Comparative Rates of Conduction System Firing

The pattern of prepotential or spontaneous depolarization, followed by rapid depolarization and repolarization just
described, are seen in the SA node and a few other conductive cells in the heart.
