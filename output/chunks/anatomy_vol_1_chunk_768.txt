Muscles acting across the shoulder will also pull the shoulder and lateral clavicle anteriorly and medially, causing
the clavicle fragments to override. The clavicle overlies many important blood vessels and nerves for the upper limb, but
fortunately, due to the anterior displacement of a broken clavicle, these structures are rarely affected when the clavicle is
fractured.

 Scapula

The scapula is also part of the pectoral girdle and thus plays an important role in anchoring the upper limb to the body. The
scapula is located on the posterior side of the shoulder. It is surrounded by muscles on both its anterior (deep) and posterior
(superficial) sides, and thus does not articulate with the ribs of the thoracic cage.

 The scapula has several important landmarks (Figure 8.4). The three margins or borders of the scapula, named for
their positions within the body, are the superior border of the scapula, the medial border of the scapula, and the lateral
border of the scapula.
