This process continues until the final
codon on the mRNA is reached which provides a “stop” message that signals termination of translation and triggers the
release of the complete, newly synthesized protein. Thus, a gene within the DNA molecule is transcribed into mRNA, which
is then translated into a protein product (Figure 3.29).

Translation

Figure 3.29 From DNA to Protein: Transcription through Translation Transcription within the cell nucleus
produces an mRNA molecule, which is modified and then sent into the cytoplasm for translation. The transcript is
decoded into a protein with the help of a ribosome and tRNA molecules.

 Commonly, an mRNA transcription will be translated simultaneously by several adjacent ribosomes. This increases
the efficiency of protein synthesis. A single ribosome might translate an mRNA molecule in approximately one minute;
so multiple ribosomes aboard a single transcript could produce multiple times the number of the same protein in the same
minute.
