Explain the structure and function of venous valves in the large veins of the extremities

Blood is carried through the body via blood vessels. An artery is a blood vessel that carries blood away from the heart,
where it branches into ever-smaller vessels. Eventually, the smallest arteries, vessels called arterioles, further branch into
tiny capillaries, where nutrients and wastes are exchanged, and then combine with other vessels that exit capillaries to form
venules, small blood vessels that carry blood to a vein, a larger blood vessel that returns blood to the heart.

 Arteries and veins transport blood in two distinct circuits: the systemic circuit and the pulmonary circuit (Figure 20.2).
 Systemic arteries provide blood rich in oxygen to the bodyâ€™s tissues. The blood returned to the heart through systemic
veins has less oxygen, since much of the oxygen carried by the arteries has been delivered to the cells.
