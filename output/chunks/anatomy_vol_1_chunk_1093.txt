Instead, there is a series of neurotransmitter-filled bulges called varicosities as an axon
courses through smooth muscle, loosely forming motor units (Figure 10.25). A varicosity releases neurotransmitters into
the synaptic cleft. Also, visceral muscle in the walls of the hollow organs (except the heart) contains pacesetter cells. A
pacesetter cell can spontaneously trigger action potentials and contractions in the muscle.

Figure 10.25 Motor Units A series of axon-like swelling, called varicosities or “boutons,” from autonomic neurons
form motor units through the smooth muscle.

 Smooth muscle is organized in two ways: as single-unit smooth muscle, which is much more common; and as multiunit
smooth muscle.
