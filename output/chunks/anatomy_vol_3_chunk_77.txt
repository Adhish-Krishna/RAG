The symptoms of central sleep apnea are similar to those of
obstructive sleep apnea.

 A diagnosis of sleep apnea is usually done during a sleep study, where the patient is monitored in a sleep
laboratory for several nights. The patient’s blood oxygen levels, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure are
monitored, as are brain activity and the volume of air that is inhaled and exhaled. Treatment of sleep apnea commonly
includes the use of a device called a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine during sleep. The CPAP
machine has a mask that covers the nose, or the nose and mouth, and forces air into the airway at regular intervals. This
pressurized air can help to gently force the airway to remain open, allowing more normal ventilation to occur. Other
treatments include lifestyle changes to decrease weight, eliminate alcohol and other sleep apnea—promoting drugs, and
changes in sleep position.
