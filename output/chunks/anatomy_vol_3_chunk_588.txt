As hydrostatic pressure in the kidneys increases, the amount of water
leaving the capillaries also increases, and more urine filtrate is formed. If hydrostatic pressure in the kidneys drops too low,
as can happen in dehydration, the functions of the kidneys will be impaired, and less nitrogenous wastes will be removed
from the bloodstream. Extreme dehydration can result in kidney failure.

 Fluid also moves between compartments along an osmotic gradient. Recall that an osmotic gradient is produced by
the difference in concentration of all solutes on either side of a semi-permeable membrane. The magnitude of the osmotic
gradient is proportional to the difference in the concentration of solutes on one side of the cell membrane to that on the other
side. Water will move by osmosis from the side where its concentration is high (and the concentration of solute is low) to
the side of the membrane where its concentration is low (and the concentration of solute is high).
