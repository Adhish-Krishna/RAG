Co-transport uses
the movement of one molecule through the membrane from higher to lower concentration to power the movement o:
another from lower to higher. Finally, endocytosis is a transportation process in which the cell membrane engulfs material.
 It requires energy, generally in the form of ATP.

 Because the cellâ€™s plasma membrane is made up of hydrophobic phospholipids, water-soluble nutrients must use
transport molecules embedded in the membrane to enter cells. Moreover, substances cannot pass between the epithelial cells
of the intestinal mucosa because these cells are bound together by tight junctions. Thus, substances can only enter blood
capillaries by passing through the apical surfaces of epithelial cells and into the interstitial fluid. Water-soluble nutrients
enter the capillary blood in the villi and travel to the liver via the hepatic portal vein.

 In contrast to the water-soluble nutrients, lipid-soluble nutrients can diffuse through the plasma membrane.
