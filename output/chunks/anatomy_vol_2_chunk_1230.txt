Figure 20.25 Aorta The aorta has distinct regions, including the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and the descending
aorta, which includes the thoracic and abdominal regions.

 Components of the Aorta

Vessel Description

Largest artery in the body, originating from the left ventricle and descending to the
abdominal region, where it bifurcates into the common iliac arteries at the level of the fourth
lumbar vertebra; arteries originating from the aorta distribute blood to virtually all tissues of
he body

Initial portion of the aorta, rising superiorly from the left ventricle for a distance of
approximately 5 cm

Aorta

Ascending aorta

Graceful arc to the left that connects the ascending aorta to the descending aorta; ends at

Aortic arch he intervertebral disk between the fourth and fifth thoracic vertebrae
Descending Portion of the aorta that continues inferiorly past the end of the aortic arch; subdivided into
aorta he thoracic aorta and the abdominal aorta

Thoracic aorta | Portion of the descending aorta superior to the aortic hiatus

Abdominal aorta | Portion of the aorta inferior to the aortic hiatus and superior to the common iliac arteries

Table 20.5

Coronary Circulation

The first vessels that branch from the ascending aorta are the paired coronary arteries (see Figure 20.25), which arise from
two of the three sinuses in the ascending aorta just superior to the aortic semilunar valve.
