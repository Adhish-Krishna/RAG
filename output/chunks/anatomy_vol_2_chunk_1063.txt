Treatment relies upon establishing the underlying cause of the disorder and may necessitate
supplemental oxygen.

 Tachycardia is not normal in a resting patient but may be detected in pregnant women or individuals experiencing
extreme stress. In the latter case, it would likely be triggered by stimulation from the limbic system or disorders of
the autonomic nervous system. In some cases, tachycardia may involve only the atria. Some individuals may remain
asymptomatic, but when present, symptoms may include dizziness, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, rapid pulse,
heart palpations, chest pain, or fainting (syncope). While tachycardia is defined as a HR above 100 bpm, there is
considerable variation among people. Further, the normal resting HRs of children are often above 100 bpm, but
this is not considered to be tachycardia Many causes of tachycardia may be benign, but the condition may also be
correlated with fever, anemia, hypoxia, hyperthyroidism, hypersecretion of catecholamines, some cardiomyopathies,
some disorders of the valves, and acute exposure to radiation.
