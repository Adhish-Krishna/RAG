Only a light or electron
microscope can reveal these structures. Even then, serial sections and computer reconstruction are necessary to give us a
comprehensive view of the functional anatomy of the nephron and its associated blood vessels.

 Nephrons: The Functional Unit

Nephrons take a simple filtrate of the blood and modify it into urine. Many changes take place in the different parts of the
nephron before urine is created for disposal. The term forming urine will be used hereafter to describe the filtrate as it is
modified into true urine. The principle task of the nephron population is to balance the plasma to homeostatic set points and
excrete potential toxins in the urine. They do this by accomplishing three principle functionsâ€”filtration, reabsorption, and
secretion. They also have additional secondary functions that exert control in three areas: blood pressure (via production of
renin), red blood cell production (via the hormone EPO), and calcium absorption (via conversion of calcidiol into calcitriol,
the active form of vitamin D).
