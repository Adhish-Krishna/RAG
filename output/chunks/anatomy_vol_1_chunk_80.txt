30 CHAPTER 1] AN INTRODUCTION TO THE HUMAN BODY

Anatomical Position

To further increase precision , anatomists standardize the way in which they view the body. Just as maps are normally
oriented with north at the top, the standard body “map,” or anatomical position, is that of the body standing upright, with
the feet at shoulder width and parallel, toes forward. The upper limbs are held out to each side, and the palms of the hands
face forward as illustrated in Figure 1.12. Using this standard position reduces confusion. It does not matter how the body
being described is oriented, the terms are used as if it is in anatomical position. For example, a scar in the “anterior (front)
carpal (wrist) region” would be present on the palm side of the wrist. The term “anterior” would be used even if the hand
were palm down on a table.
