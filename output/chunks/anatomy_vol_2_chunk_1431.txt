Hypersensitivities

The word “hypersensitivity” simply means sensitive beyond normal levels of activation. Allergies and inflammatory
responses to nonpathogenic environmental substances have been observed since the dawn of history. Hypersensitivity is a
medical term describing symptoms that are now known to be caused by unrelated mechanisms of immunity. Still, it is useful
for this discussion to use the four types of hypersensitivities as a guide to understand these mechanisms (Figure 21.28).
