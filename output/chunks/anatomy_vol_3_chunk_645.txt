In cases of respiratory alkalosis,
the kidneys decrease the production of bicarbonate and reabsorb H* from the tubular fluid. These processes can be limited

by the exchange of potassium by the renal cells, which use a K*-H* exchange mechanism (antiporter).
 Diagnosing Acidosis and Alkalosis

Lab tests for pH, COz2 partial pressure (pCO2), and HCO3° can identify acidosis and alkalosis, indicating whether the
imbalance is respiratory or metabolic, and the extent to which compensatory mechanisms are working. The blood pH
value, as shown in Table 26.3, indicates whether the blood is in acidosis, the normal range, or alkalosis. The pCO2 and
total HCO3° values aid in determining whether the condition is metabolic or respiratory, and whether the patient has been
able to compensate for the problem. Table 26.3 lists the conditions and laboratory results that can be used to classify
these conditions. Metabolic acid-base imbalances typically result from kidney disease, and the respiratory system usually
responds to compensate.
