This energy is expended as the myosin
head moves through the power stroke, and at the end of the power stroke, the myosin head is in a low-energy position.
 After the power stroke, ADP is released; however, the formed cross-bridge is still in place, and actin and myosin are bound
together. As long as ATP is available, it readily attaches to myosin, the cross-bridge cycle can recur, and muscle contraction
can continue.

 Note that each thick filament of roughly 300 myosin molecules has multiple myosin heads, and many cross-bridges
form and break continuously during muscle contraction. Multiply this by all of the sarcomeres in one myofibril, all the
myofibrils in one muscle fiber, and all of the muscle fibers in one skeletal muscle, and you can understand why so much
energy (ATP) is needed to keep skeletal muscles working.
