This is a factor contributing to the very slow healing of cartilaginous tissues.

CHAPTER 4 | THE TISSUE LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION 151.

 The three main types of cartilage tissue are hyaline cartilage, fibrocartilage, and elastic cartilage (Figure 4.16).
 Hyaline cartilage, the most common type of cartilage in the body, consists of short and dispersed collagen fibers and
contains large amounts of proteoglycans. Under the microscope, tissue samples appear clear. The surface of hyaline
cartilage is smooth. Both strong and flexible, it is found in the rib cage and nose and covers bones where they meet to form
moveable joints. It makes up a template of the embryonic skeleton before bone formation. A plate of hyaline cartilage at
the ends of bone allows continued growth until adulthood. Fibrocartilage is tough because it has thick bundles of collagen
fibers dispersed through its matrix. The knee and jaw joints and the the intervertebral discs are examples of fibrocartilage.
