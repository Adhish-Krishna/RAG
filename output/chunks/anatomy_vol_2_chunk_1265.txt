Figure 20.36 Veins of the Thoracic and Abdominal Regions Veins of the thoracic and abdominal regions drain
blood from the area above the diaphragm, returning it to the right atrium via the superior vena cava.

 Veins of the Thoracic Region

Vessel Description

Superior vena
cava

Large systemic vein; drains blood from most areas superior to the diaphragm; empties into
the right atrium

Located deep in the thoracic cavity; formed by the axillary vein as it enters the thoracic
cavity from the axillary region; drains the axillary and smaller local veins near the scapular
region and leads to the brachiocephalic vein

Subclavian vein

Veins of the Thoracic Region

Vessel

Brachiocephalic
veins

Vertebral vein

Description

Pair of veins that form from a fusion of the external and internal jugular veins and the
subclavian vein; subclavian, external and internal jugulars, vertebral, and internal thoracic
veins flow into it; drain the upper thoracic region and lead to the superior vena cava

Arises from the base of the brain and the cervical region of the spinal cord; passes through
he intervertebral foramina in the cervical vertebrae; drains smaller veins from the cranium,
spinal cord, and vertebrae, and leads to the brachiocephalic vein; counterpart of the
vertebral artery

Internal thoracic
veins

Also called internal mammary veins; drain the anterior surface of the chest wall and lead to
he brachiocephalic vein

Intercostal vein

Drains the muscles of the thoracic wall and leads to the azygos vein

Esophageal
vein

Drains the inferior portions of the esophagus and leads to the azygos vein

Bronchial vein

Drains the systemic circulation from the lungs and leads to the azygos vein

Originates in the lumbar region and passes through the diaphragm into the thoracic cavity
on the right side of the vertebral column; drains blood from the intercostal veins, esophageal

Azygos vein veins, bronchial veins, and other veins draining the mediastinal region, and leads to the
superior vena cava
