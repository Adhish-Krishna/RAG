Physical stimuli, such as pressure and
vibration, as well as the sensation of sound and body position (balance), are interpreted through a mechanoreceptor.
 Another physical stimulus that has its own type of receptor is temperature, which is sensed through a thermoreceptor that
is either sensitive to temperatures above (heat) or below (cold) normal body temperature.

 Sensory Modalities

Ask anyone what the senses are, and they are likely to list the five major sensesâ€”taste, smell, touch, hearing, and sight.
 However, these are not all of the senses. The most obvious omission from this list is balance. Also, what is referred to
simply as touch can be further subdivided into pressure, vibration, stretch, and hair-follicle position, on the basis of the
type of mechanoreceptors that perceive these touch sensations.
