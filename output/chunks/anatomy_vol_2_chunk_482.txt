Nervous System: Kehr’s Sign

Kehr’s sign is the presentation of pain in the left shoulder, chest, and neck regions following rupture of the spleen. The
spleen is in the upper-left abdominopelvic quadrant, but the pain is more in the shoulder and neck. How can this be?
 The sympathetic fibers connected to the spleen are from the celiac ganglion, which would be from the mid-thoracic to
lower thoracic region whereas parasympathetic fibers are found in the vagus nerve, which connects in the medulla of
the brain stem.
