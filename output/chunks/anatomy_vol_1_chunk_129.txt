The most common
form of carbon, for example, has six neutrons as well as six protons, for a total of 12 subatomic particles in its nucleus.
 An element’s mass number is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. So the most common form of
carbon’s mass number is 12. (Electrons have so little mass that they do not appreciably contribute to the mass of an atom.)
 Carbon is a relatively light element. Uranium (U), in contrast, has a mass number of 238 and is referred to as a heavy metal.
 Its atomic number is 92 (it has 92 protons) but it contains 146 neutrons; it has the most mass of all the naturally occurring
elements.

 The periodic table of the elements, shown in Figure 2.4, is a chart identifying the 92 elements found in nature, as well
as several larger, unstable elements discovered experimentally.
