The posterior horn is responsible for sensory processing.
 The anterior horn sends out motor signals to the skeletal muscles. The lateral horn, which is only found in the thoracic,
upper lumbar, and sacral regions, is the central component of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system.

 Some of the largest neurons of the spinal cord are the multipolar motor neurons in the anterior horn. The fibers that
cause contraction of skeletal muscles are the axons of these neurons. The motor neuron that causes contraction of the big
toe, for example, is located in the sacral spinal cord. The axon that has to reach all the way to the belly of that muscle may
be a meter in length. The neuronal cell body that maintains that long fiber must be quite large, possibly several hundred
micrometers in diameter, making it one of the largest cells in the body.
