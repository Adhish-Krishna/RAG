Â¢ Discuss the appearance of primary and secondary ossification centers

Embryologically, the appendicular skeleton arises from mesenchyme, a type of embryonic tissue that can differentiate into
many types of tissues, including bone or muscle tissue. Mesenchyme gives rise to the bones of the upper and lower limbs, as
well as to the pectoral and pelvic girdles. Development of the limbs begins near the end of the fourth embryonic week, with
the upper limbs appearing first. Thereafter, the development of the upper and lower limbs follows similar patterns, with the
lower limbs lagging behind the upper limbs by a few days.

 Limb Growth

Each upper and lower limb initially develops as a small bulge called a limb bud, which appears on the lateral side of
the early embryo. The upper limb bud appears near the end of the fourth week of development, with the lower limb bud
appearing shortly after (Figure 8.20).
