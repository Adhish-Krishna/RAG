According to the octet rule, magnesium is unstable (reactive) because its valence shell has just two
electrons. It is therefore likely to participate in chemical reactions in which it donates two electrons. 36 A carbon atom has four
electrons in its valence shell. According to the octet rule, it will readily participate in chemical reactions that result in its valence
shell having eight electrons. Hydrogen, with one electron, will complete its valence shell with two. Electron sharing between an
atom of carbon and four atoms of hydrogen meets the requirements of all atoms. The bonds are covalent because the electrons are
shared: although hydrogen often participates in ionic bonds, carbon does not because it is highly unlikely to donate or accept four
electrons. 37 Water is a polar molecule. It has a region of weakly positive charge and a region of weakly negative charge. These
regions are attracted to ions as well as to other polar molecules. Oils are nonpolar, and are repelled by water.
