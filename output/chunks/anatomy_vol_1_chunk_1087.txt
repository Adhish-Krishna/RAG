Explain how smooth muscle works with internal organs and passageways through the body
¢ Explain how smooth muscles differ from skeletal and cardiac muscles
¢ Explain the difference between single-unit and multi-unit smooth muscle

Smooth muscle (so-named because the cells do not have striations) is present in the walls of hollow organs like the urinary
bladder, uterus, stomach, intestines, and in the walls of passageways, such as the arteries and veins of the circulatory system,
and the tracts of the respiratory, urinary, and reproductive systems (Figure 10.23ab). Smooth muscle is also present in the
eyes, where it functions to change the size of the iris and alter the shape of the lens; and in the skin where it causes hair to
stand erect in response to cold temperature or fear.
