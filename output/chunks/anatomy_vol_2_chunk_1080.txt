Severely high
hypernatremia may lead to fibrillation, which may cause CO to cease. Severe hyponatremia leads to both bradycardia and
other arrhythmias. Hypokalemia (low potassium levels) also leads to arrhythmias, whereas hyperkalemia (high potassium
levels) causes the heart to become weak and flaccid, and ultimately to fail.

 Heart muscle relies exclusively on aerobic metabolism for energy. Hypoxia (an insufficient supply of oxygen) leads to
decreasing HRs, since metabolic reactions fueling heart contraction are restricted.

 Acidosis is a condition in which excess hydrogen ions are present, and the patient’s blood expresses a low pH value.
 Alkalosis is a condition in which there are too few hydrogen ions, and the patient’s blood has an elevated pH. Normal blood
pH falls in the range of 7.35-7.45, so a number lower than this range represents acidosis and a higher number represents
alkalosis.
