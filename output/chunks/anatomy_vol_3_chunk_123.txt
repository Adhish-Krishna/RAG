At about week 19, the respiratory
bronchioles have formed. In addition, cells lining the respiratory structures begin to differentiate to form type I and type II
pneumocytes. Once type II cells have differentiated, they begin to secrete small amounts of pulmonary surfactant. Around
week 20, fetal breathing movements may begin.

 Weeks 24-Term

Major growth and maturation of the respiratory system occurs from week 24 until term. More alveolar precursors develop,
and larger amounts of pulmonary surfactant are produced. Surfactant levels are not generally adequate to create effective
lung compliance until about the eighth month of pregnancy. The respiratory system continues to expand, and the surfaces
that will form the respiratory membrane develop further. At this point, pulmonary capillaries have formed and continue to
expand, creating a large surface area for gas exchange. The major milestone of respiratory development occurs at around
week 28, when sufficient alveolar precursors have matured so that a baby born prematurely at this time can usually breathe
on its own.
