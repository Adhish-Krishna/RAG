Transport across the Cell Membrane

One of the great wonders of the cell membrane is its ability to regulate the concentration of substances inside the cell. These

substances include ions such as Ca**, Na’, K’, and CI ; nutrients including sugars, fatty acids, and amino acids; and waste
products, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), which must leave the cell.

 The membrane’s lipid bilayer structure provides the first level of control. The phospholipids are tightly packed
together, and the membrane has a hydrophobic interior. This structure causes the membrane to be selectively permeable.
 A membrane that has selective permeability allows only substances meeting certain criteria to pass through it unaided.
 In the case of the cell membrane, only relatively small, nonpolar materials can move through the lipid bilayer (remember,
the lipid tails of the membrane are nonpolar).
