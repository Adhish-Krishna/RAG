In addition, the mucous membrane traps debris and pathogens.

 A bronchiole branches from the tertiary bronchi. Bronchioles, which are about 1 mm in diameter, further branch until
they become the tiny terminal bronchioles, which lead to the structures of gas exchange. There are more than 1000 terminal
bronchioles in each lung. The muscular walls of the bronchioles do not contain cartilage like those of the bronchi. This
muscular wall can change the size of the tubing to increase or decrease airflow through the tube.

 Respiratory Zone

 In contrast to the conducting zone, the respiratory zone includes structures that are directly involved in gas exchange.
 The respiratory zone begins where the terminal bronchioles join a respiratory bronchiole, the smallest type of bronchiole
(Figure 22.10), which then leads to an alveolar duct, opening into a cluster of alveoli.
