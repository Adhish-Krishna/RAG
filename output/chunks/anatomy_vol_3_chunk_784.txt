A normal ovulation cycle produces only one oocyte, but
the number can be boosted significantly (to 10-20 oocytes) by administering a short course of gonadotropins. The
course begins with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) analogs, which support the development of multiple follicles,
and ends with a luteinizing hormone (LH) analog that triggers ovulation. Right before the ova would be released from
the ovary, they are harvested using ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval. In this procedure, ultrasound allows a physician
to visualize mature follicles. The ova are aspirated (sucked out) using a syringe.

 In parallel, sperm are obtained from the male partner or from a sperm bank. The sperm are prepared by washing
to remove seminal fluid because seminal fluid contains a peptide, FPP (or, fertilization promoting peptide), that—in
high concentrations—prevents capacitation of the sperm.
