CHAPTER 28 | DEVELOPMENT AND INHERITANCE

corona radiata in an oocyte, a layer of granulosa cells that surrounds the oocyte and that must be penetrated by sperm
before fertilization can occur

cortical reaction following fertilization, the release of cortical granules from the oocyte’s plasma membrane into the
zona pellucida creating a fertilization membrane that prevents any further attachment or penetration of sperm; part
of the slow block to polyspermy

dilation first stage of childbirth, involving an increase in cervical diameter

dominant lethal inheritance pattern in which individuals with one or two copies of a lethal allele do not survive in
utero or have a shortened life span

dominant describes a trait that is expressed both in homozygous and heterozygous form

ductus arteriosus shunt in the pulmonary trunk that diverts oxygenated blood back to the aorta
ductus venosus shunt that causes oxygenated blood to bypass the fetal liver on its way to the inferior vena cava

ectoderm primary germ layer that develops into the central and peripheral nervous systems, sensory organs, epidermis,
hair, and nails

ectopic pregnancy implantation of an embryo outside of the uterus
embryo developing human during weeks 3-8

embryonic folding process by which an embryo develops from a flat disc of cells to a three-dimensional shape
resembling a cylinder

endoderm primary germ layer that goes on to form the gastrointestinal tract, liver, pancreas, and lungs

epiblast upper layer of cells of the embryonic disc that forms from the inner cell mass; gives rise to all three germ
layers

episiotomy incision made in the posterior vaginal wall and perineum that facilitates vaginal birth

expulsion second stage of childbirth, during which the mother bears down with contractions; this stage ends in birth
fertilization membrane impenetrable barrier that coats a nascent zygote; part of the slow block to polyspermy
fertilization unification of genetic material from male and female haploid gametes

fetus developing human during the time from the end of the embryonic period (week 9) to birth

foramen ovale shunt that directly connects the right and left atria and helps divert oxygenated blood from the fetal
pulmonary circuit

foremilk watery, translucent breast milk that is secreted first during a feeding and is rich in lactose and protein; quenches
the infant’s thirst

gastrulation process of cell migration and differentiation into three primary germ layers following cleavage and
implantation

genotype complete genetic makeup of an individual

gestation in human development, the period required for embryonic and fetal development in utero; pregnancy
heterozygous having two different alleles for a given gene

hindmilk opaque, creamy breast milk delivered toward the end of a feeding; rich in fat; satisfies the infant’s appetite
homozygous having two identical alleles for a given gene

human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone that directs the corpus luteum to survive, enlarge, and continue
producing progesterone and estrogen to suppress menses and secure an environment suitable for the developing
embryo

hypoblast lower layer of cells of the embryonic disc that extend into the blastocoel to form the yolk sac

implantation process by which a blastocyst embeds itself in the uterine endometrium

incomplete dominance pattern of inheritance in which a heterozygous genotype expresses a phenotype intermediate
between dominant and recessive phenotypes

inner cell mass cluster of cells within the blastocyst that is fated to become the embryo
involution postpartum shrinkage of the uterus back to its pre-pregnancy volume
