Meiosis has two rounds of cell division:
primary spermatocyte to secondary spermatocyte, and then secondary spermatocyte to spermatid. This produces four
haploid daughter cells (spermatids). (b) In this electron micrograph of a cross-section of a seminiferous tubule from a
rat, the lumen is the light-shaded area in the center of the image. The location of the primary spermatocytes is near the
basement membrane, and the early spermatids are approaching the lumen (tissue source: rat). EM x 900. (Micrograph

Two identical diploid cells result from spermatogonia mitosis. One of these cells remains a spermatogonium, and the
other becomes a primary spermatocyte, the next stage in the process of spermatogenesis. As in mitosis, DNA is replicated
in a primary spermatocyte, and the cell undergoes cell division to produce two cells with identical chromosomes.
