The glands of the cardia and pylorus are composed primarily of mucus-secreting cells. Cells that make up the
pyloric antrum secrete mucus and a number of hormones, including the majority of the stimulatory hormone, gastrin. The
much larger glands of the fundus and body of the stomach, the site of most chemical digestion, produce most of the gastric
secretions. These glands are made up of a variety of secretory cells. These include parietal cells, chief cells, mucous neck
cells, and enteroendocrine cells.

 Parietal cells—Located primarily in the middle region of the gastric glands are parietal cells, which are among the
most highly differentiated of the body’s epithelial cells. These relatively large cells produce both hydrochloric acid (HCl)
and intrinsic factor. HC] is responsible for the high acidity (pH 1.5 to 3.5) of the stomach contents and is needed to activate
the protein-digesting enzyme, pepsin.
