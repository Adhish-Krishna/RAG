Respiratory capacity is the combination of two or more selected volumes, which further describes the amount of air in
the lungs during a given time. For example, total lung capacity (TLC) is the sum of all of the lung volumes (TV, ERV, IRV,
and RV), which represents the total amount of air a person can hold in the lungs after a forceful inhalation. TLC is about
6000 mL air for men, and about 4200 mL for women. Vital capacity (VC) is the amount of air a person can move into or
out of his or her lungs, and is the sum of all of the volumes except residual volume (TV, ERV, and IRV), which is between
4000 and 5000 milliliters.
