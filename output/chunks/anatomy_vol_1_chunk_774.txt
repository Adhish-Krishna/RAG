These consist of the arm, located between the shoulder and elbow joints; the
forearm, which is between the elbow and wrist joints; and the hand, which is located distal to the wrist. There are 30 bones
in each upper limb (see Figure 8.2). The humerus is the single bone of the upper arm, and the ulna (medially) and the
radius (laterally) are the paired bones of the forearm. The base of the hand contains eight bones, each called a carpal bone,
and the palm of the hand is formed by five bones, each called a metacarpal bone. The fingers and thumb contain a total of
4 bones, each of which is a phalanx bone of the hand.

 Humerus

The humerus is the single bone of the upper arm region (Figure 8.5). At its proximal end is the head of the humerus.
 This is the large, round, smooth region that faces medially. The head articulates with the glenoid cavity of the scapula to
orm the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint.
