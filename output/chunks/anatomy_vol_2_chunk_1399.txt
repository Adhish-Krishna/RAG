After secreting antibodies for a specific period, they die, as most of their energy is devoted
to making antibodies and not to maintaining themselves. Thus, plasma cells are said to be terminally differentiated.

 The final B cell of interest is the memory B cell, which results from the clonal expansion of an activated B cell.
 Memory B cells function in a way similar to memory T cells. They lead to a stronger and faster secondary response when
compared to the primary response, as illustrated below.

 Antibody Structure

Antibodies are glycoproteins consisting of two types of polypeptide chains with attached carbohydrates. The heavy chain
and the light chain are the two polypeptides that form the antibody. The main differences between the classes of antibodies
are in the differences between their heavy chains, but as you shall see, the light chains have an important role, forming part
of the antigen-binding site on the antibody molecules.
