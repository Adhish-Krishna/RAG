From this point to the ends of the collecting ducts, the filtrate or forming urine is undergoing modification through
secretion and reabsorption before true urine is produced. The first point at which the forming urine is modified is in the
PCT. Here, some substances are reabsorbed, whereas others are secreted. Note the use of the term “reabsorbed.” All of
these substances were “absorbed” in the digestive tract—99 percent of the water and most of the solutes filtered by the
nephron must be reabsorbed. Water and substances that are reabsorbed are returned to the circulation by the peritubular
and vasa recta capillaries. It is important to understand the difference between the glomerulus and the peritubular and vasa
recta capillaries. The glomerulus has a relatively high pressure inside its capillaries and can sustain this by dilating the
afferent arteriole while constricting the efferent arteriole. This assures adequate filtration pressure even as the systemic
blood pressure varies. Movement of water into the peritubular capillaries and vasa recta will be influenced primarily by
osmolarity and concentration gradients.
