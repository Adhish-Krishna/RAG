These cells then become slightly more specialized,
and are referred to as multipotent cells.

 A multipotent stem cell has the potential to differentiate into different types of cells within a given cell lineage or
small number of lineages, such as a red blood cell or white blood cell.

 Finally, multipotent cells can become further specialized oligopotent cells. An oligopotent stem cell is limited to
becoming one of a few different cell types. In contrast, a unipotent cell is fully specialized and can only reproduce to
generate more of its own specific cell type.

 Stem cells are unique in that they can also continually divide and regenerate new stem cells instead of further
specializing. There are different stem cells present at different stages of a humanâ€™s life. They include the embryonic stem
cells of the embryo, fetal stem cells of the fetus, and adult stem cells in the adult. One type of adult stem cell is the epithelial
stem cell, which gives rise to the keratinocytes in the multiple layers of epithelial cells in the epidermis of skin.
