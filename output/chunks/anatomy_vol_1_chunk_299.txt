Antioxidants work by being oxidized themselves, halting the destructive reaction cascades initiated by the free
radicals. Sometimes though, ROS accumulate beyond the capacity of such defenses.

 Oxidative stress is the term used to describe damage to cellular components caused by ROS. Due to their characteristic
unpaired electrons, ROS can set off chain reactions where they remove electrons from other molecules, which then become
oxidized and reactive, and do the same to other molecules, causing a chain reaction. ROS can cause permanent damage to
cellular lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. Damaged DNA can lead to genetic mutations and even cancer. A
mutation is a change in the nucleotide sequence in a gene within a cell’s DNA, potentially altering the protein coded by that
gene. Other diseases believed to be triggered or exacerbated by ROS include Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular diseases,
diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, arthritis, Huntington’s disease, and schizophrenia, among many others.
