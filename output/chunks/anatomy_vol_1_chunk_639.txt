Inside the nasal area of the skull, the nasal cavity is divided into halves by the nasal septum. The upper portion of the
nasal septum is formed by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone and the lower portion is the vomer bone. Each
side of the nasal cavity is triangular in shape, with a broad inferior space that narrows superiorly. When looking into the
nasal cavity from the front of the skull, two bony plates are seen projecting from each lateral wall. The larger of these is the
inferior nasal concha, an independent bone of the skull. Located just above the inferior concha is the middle nasal concha,
which is part of the ethmoid bone. A third bony plate, also part of the ethmoid bone, is the superior nasal concha. It is much
smaller and out of sight, above the middle concha. The superior nasal concha is located just lateral to the perpendicular
plate, in the upper nasal cavity.
