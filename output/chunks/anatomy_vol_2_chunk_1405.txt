IgE is usually associated with allergies and anaphylaxis. It is present in the lowest concentration in the blood, because
its Fc region binds strongly to an IgE-specific Fc receptor on the surfaces of mast cells. IgE makes mast cell degranulation
very specific, such that if a person is allergic to peanuts, there will be peanut-specific IgE bound to his or her mast cells. In
this person, eating peanuts will cause the mast cells to degranulate, sometimes causing severe allergic reactions, including
anaphylaxis, a severe, systemic allergic response that can cause death.

 Clonal Selection of B Cells

Clonal selection and expansion work much the same way in B cells as in T cells. Only B cells with appropriate antigen
specificity are selected for and expanded (Figure 21.23). Eventually, the plasma cells secrete antibodies with antigenic
specificity identical to those that were on the surfaces of the selected B cells.
