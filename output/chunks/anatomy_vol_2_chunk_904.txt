This process also wrings out of the clot a small amount of fluid called serum, which is blood plasma
without its clotting factors.

 To restore normal blood flow as the vessel heals, the clot must eventually be removed. Fibrinolysis is the gradual
degradation of the clot. Again, there is a fairly complicated series of reactions that involves factor XII and protein-
catabolizing enzymes. During this process, the inactive protein plasminogen is converted into the active plasmin, which
gradually breaks down the fibrin of the clot. Additionally, bradykinin, a vasodilator, is released, reversing the effects of the
serotonin and prostaglandins from the platelets. This allows the smooth muscle in the walls of the vessels to relax and helps
to restore the circulation.

 Plasma Anticoagulants

An anticoagulant is any substance that opposes coagulation. Several circulating plasma anticoagulants play a role in
limiting the coagulation process to the region of injury and restoring a normal, clot-free condition of blood.
