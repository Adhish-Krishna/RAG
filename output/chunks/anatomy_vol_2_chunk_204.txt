When the substantia nigra pars compacta is silent, the body is in a passive state, and movement is inhibited.
 To illustrate this situation, while a student is sitting listening to a lecture, the substantia nigra pars compacta would be silent
and the student less likely to get up and walk around. Likewise, while the professor is lecturing, and walking around at the
front of the classroom, the professor’s substantia nigra pars compacta would be active, in keeping with his or her activity
level.

 Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/basalnucleil) to learn about the basal nuclei (also known as the basal
ganglia), which have two pathways that process information within the cerebrum. As shown in this video, the direct
pathway is the shorter pathway through the system that results in increased activity in the cerebral cortex and increased
motor activity. The direct pathway is described as resulting in “disinhibition” of the thalamus. What does disinhibition
mean? What are the two neurons doing individually to cause this?
