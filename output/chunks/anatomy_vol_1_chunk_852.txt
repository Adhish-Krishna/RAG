On the proximal radius, the narrowed region below the head is the neck; distal
to this is the radial tuberosity. The shaft portions of both the ulna and radius have an interosseous border, whereas the distal
ends of each bone have a pointed styloid process. The distal radioulnar joint is found between the head of the ulna and the
ulnar notch of the radius. The distal end of the radius articulates with the proximal carpal bones, but the ulna does not.


 324 CHAPTER 8 | THE APPENDICULAR SKELETON

The base of the hand is formed by eight carpal bones. The carpal bones are united into two rows of bones. The
proximal row contains (from lateral to medial) the scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, and pisiform bones. The scaphoid, lunate,
and triquetrum bones contribute to the formation of the radiocarpal joint. The distal row of carpal bones contains (from
medial to lateral) the hamate, capitate, trapezoid, and trapezium bones (“So Long To Pinky, Here Comes The Thumb”).
