Current treatments for managing osteoporosis include bisphosphonates (the same medications often used in
Pagetâ€™s disease), calcitonin, and estrogen (for women only). Minimizing the risk of falls, for example, by removing
tripping hazards, is also an important step in managing the potential outcomes from the disease.

 Hormones That Influence Osteoclasts

Bone modeling and remodeling require osteoclasts to resorb unneeded, damaged, or old bone, and osteoblasts to lay down
new bone. Two hormones that affect the osteoclasts are parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin.

PTH stimulates osteoclast proliferation and activity. As a result, calcium is released from the bones into the circulation,
thus increasing the calcium ion concentration in the blood. PTH also promotes the reabsorption of calcium by the kidney
tubules, which can affect calcium homeostasis (see below).
