There is also a small population of neurons that control vasodilation in the vessels of the brain and skeletal muscles
by relaxing the smooth muscle fibers in the vessel tunics. Many of these are cholinergic neurons, that is, they release
acetylcholine, which in turn stimulates the vesselsâ€™ endothelial cells to release nitric oxide (NO), which causes vasodilation.
 Others release norepinephrine that binds to B2 receptors. A few neurons release NO directly as a neurotransmitter.

 Recall that mild stimulation of the skeletal muscles maintains muscle tone. A similar phenomenon occurs with vascular
tone in vessels. As noted earlier, arterioles are normally partially constricted: With maximal stimulation, their radius may
be reduced to one-half of the resting state. Full dilation of most arterioles requires that this sympathetic stimulation be
suppressed. When it is, an arteriole can expand by as much as 150 percent. Such a significant increase can dramatically
affect resistance, pressure, and flow.
