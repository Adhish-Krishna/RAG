However, the flattened and vertically positioned thoracic
articular processes allow for the greatest range of rotation within the vertebral column. The lumbar region allows for
considerable extension, flexion, and lateral flexion, but the orientation of the articular processes largely prohibits rotation.

 The articulations formed between the skull, the atlas (C1 vertebra), and the axis (C2 vertebra) differ from the
articulations in other vertebral areas and play important roles in movement of the head. The atlanto-occipital joint is
formed by the articulations between the superior articular processes of the atlas and the occipital condyles on the base of
the skull. This articulation has a pronounced U-shaped curvature, oriented along the anterior-posterior axis. This allows the
skull to rock forward and backward, producing flexion and extension of the head. This moves the head up and down, as
when shaking your head “yes.”

The atlantoaxial joint, between the atlas and axis, consists of three articulations.
