The significant recovery of solutes from the PCT lumen to the interstitial space creates an osmotic gradient that
promotes water recovery. As noted before, water moves through channels created by the aquaporin proteins. These proteins
are found in all cells in varying amounts and help regulate water movement across membranes and through cells by creating
a passageway across the hydrophobic lipid bilayer membrane. Changing the number of aquaporin proteins in membranes of
the collecting ducts also helps to regulate the osmolarity of the blood. The movement of many positively charged ions also
creates an electrochemical gradient. This charge promotes the movement of negative ions toward the interstitial spaces and
the movement of positive ions toward the lumen.

Reabsorption and Secretion in the Loop of Henle

The loop of Henle consists of two sections: thick and thin descending and thin and thick ascending sections.
