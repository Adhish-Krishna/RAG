Body Cavities and Serous Membranes

The body maintains its internal organization by means of membranes, sheaths, and other structures that separate
compartments. The dorsal (posterior) cavity and the ventral (anterior) cavity are the largest body compartments (Figure
1.15). These cavities contain and protect delicate internal organs, and the ventral cavity allows for significant changes in
the size and shape of the organs as they perform their functions. The lungs, heart, stomach, and intestines, for example, can
expand and contract without distorting other tissues or disrupting the activity of nearby organs.
