However, the partial pressure gradients
are opposite of those present at the respiratory membrane. The partial pressure of oxygen in tissues is low, about 40 mm Hg,
because oxygen is continuously used for cellular respiration. In contrast, the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood is about
100 mm Hg. This creates a pressure gradient that causes oxygen to dissociate from hemoglobin, diffuse out of the blood,
cross the interstitial space, and enter the tissue. Hemoglobin that has little oxygen bound to it loses much of its brightness,
so that blood returning to the heart is more burgundy in color.

 Considering that cellular respiration continuously produces carbon dioxide, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is
lower in the blood than it is in the tissue, causing carbon dioxide to diffuse out of the tissue, cross the interstitial fluid,
and enter the blood.
