When no sound is present, and the stereocilia are standing straight, a small amount of

Stereocilia

Figure 14.8 Hair Cell The hair cell is a mechanoreceptor with an array of stereocilia emerging from its apical surface.
 The stereocilia are tethered together by proteins that open ion channels when the array is bent toward the tallest
member of their array, and closed when the array is bent toward the shortest member of their array.
