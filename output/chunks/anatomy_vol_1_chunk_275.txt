Filtration
is an extremely important process in the body. For example, the circulatory system uses filtration to move plasma and
substances across the endothelial lining of capillaries and into surrounding tissues, supplying cells with the nutrients.
 Filtration pressure in the kidneys provides the mechanism to remove wastes from the bloodstream.

 Active Transport

For all of the transport methods described above, the cell expends no energy. Membrane proteins that aid in the passive
transport of substances do so without the use of ATP. During active transport, ATP is required to move a substance across a
membrane, often with the help of protein carriers, and usually against its concentration gradient.

 One of the most common types of active transport involves proteins that serve as pumps. The word “pump” probably
conjures up thoughts of using energy to pump up the tire of a bicycle or a basketball. Similarly, energy from ATP is
required for these membrane proteins to transport substances—molecules or ions—across the membrane, usually against
their concentration gradients (from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration).
