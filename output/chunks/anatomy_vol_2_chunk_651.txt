The ICP arises from the medullaâ€”specifically from the inferior olive, which is visible as a
bulge on the ventral surface of the brain stem. The MCP is the ventral surface of the pons. The SCP projects into the
midbrain.

 These connections can also be broadly described by their functions. The ICP conveys sensory input to the cerebellum,
partially from the spinocerebellar tract, but also through fibers of the inferior olive. The MCP is part of the cortico-ponto-
cerebellar pathway that connects the cerebral cortex with the cerebellum and preferentially targets the lateral regions of the
cerebellum. It includes a copy of the motor commands sent from the precentral gyrus through the corticospinal tract, arising
from collateral branches that synapse in the gray matter of the pons, along with input from other regions such as the visual
cortex.
