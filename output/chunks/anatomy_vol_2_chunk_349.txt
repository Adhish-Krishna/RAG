The eye is also divided into two cavities: the anterior cavity and the posterior cavity. The anterior cavity is the space

led the aqueous humor.

 The posterior cavity is the space behind the lens that extends to the posterior side of the interior eyeball, where the retina is

located. The posterior cavity is filled with a more viscous fluid called the vitreous humor.
 The retina is composed of several layers and contains specialized cells for the initial processi

ng of visual stimuli. The

photoreceptors (rods and cones) change their membrane potential when stimulated by light energy. The change in membrane
potential alters the amount of neurotransmitter that the photoreceptor cells release onto bipolar cells in the outer synaptic
layer. It is the bipolar cell in the retina that connects a photoreceptor to a retinal ganglion cell (RGC) in the inner synaptic

layer.
