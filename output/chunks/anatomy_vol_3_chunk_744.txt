The earliest changes occur during the menopausal transition, often referred to as peri-menopause, when a
womenâ€™s cycle becomes irregular but does not stop entirely. Although the levels of estrogen are still nearly the
same as before the transition, the level of progesterone produced by the corpus luteum is reduced. This decline in
progesterone can lead to abnormal growth, or hyperplasia, of the endometrium. This condition is a concern because it
increases the risk of developing endometrial cancer. Two harmless conditions that can develop during the transition are
uterine fibroids, which are benign masses of cells, and irregular bleeding. As estrogen levels change, other symptoms
that occur are hot flashes and night sweats, trouble sleeping, vaginal dryness, mood swings, difficulty focusing, and
thinning of hair on the head along with the growth of more hair on the face.
