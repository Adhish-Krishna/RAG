Finally, stretching of the myometrium and cervix by a full-term fetus in the vertex (head-down) position is regarded as
a stimulant to uterine contractions. The sum of these changes initiates the regular contractions known as true labor, which
become more powerful and more frequent with time. The pain of labor is attributed to myometrial hypoxia during uterine
contractions.

 Stages of Childbirth

The process of childbirth can be divided into three stages: cervical dilation, expulsion of the newborn, and afterbirth (Figure
28.21).

 Cervical Dilation

For vaginal birth to occur, the cervix must dilate fully to 10 cm in diameter—wide enough to deliver the newborn’s head.
 The dilation stage is the longest stage of labor and typically takes 6-12 hours. However, it varies widely and may take
minutes, hours, or days, depending in part on whether the mother has given birth before; in each subsequent labor, this stage
tends to be shorter.
