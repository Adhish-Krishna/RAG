Aldosterone stimulates principal
cells to manufacture luminal Na* and K* channels as well as Na"/K* ATPase pumps on the basal membrane of the cells.
 When aldosterone output increases, more Na’ is recovered from the forming urine and water follows the Na” passively. As
the pump recovers Na” for the body, it is also pumping K” into the forming urine, since the pump moves K" in the opposite
direction. When aldosterone decreases, more Na” remains in the forming urine and more K’ is recovered in the circulation.
 Symport channels move Na* and CI together. Still other channels in the principal cells secrete K* into the collecting duct
in direct proportion to the recovery of Na”.

 Intercalated cells play significant roles in regulating blood pH. Intercalated cells reabsorb K* and HCO3” while

secreting H”. This function lowers the acidity of the plasma while increasing the acidity of the urine.
