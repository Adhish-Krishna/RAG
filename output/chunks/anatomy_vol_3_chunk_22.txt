Several bones that help form the walls of the nasal cavity have air-containing spaces called the paranasal sinuses,
which serve to warm and humidify incoming air. Sinuses are lined with a mucosa. Each paranasal sinus is named for
its associated bone: frontal sinus, maxillary sinus, sphenoidal sinus, and ethmoidal sinus. The sinuses produce mucus and
lighten the weight of the skull.

 The nares and anterior portion of the nasal cavities are lined with mucous membranes, containing sebaceous glands and
hair follicles that serve to prevent the passage of large debris, such as dirt, through the nasal cavity.
