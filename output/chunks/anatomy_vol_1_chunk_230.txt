In contrast, RNA consists of a single strand of sugar-phosphate backbone studded with bases. Messenger RNA
(mRNA) is created during protein synthesis to carry the genetic instructions from the DNA to the cell’s protein
manufacturing plants in the cytoplasm, the ribosomes.

 Adenosine Triphosphate

The nucleotide adenosine triphosphate (ATP), is composed of a ribose sugar, an adenine base, and three phosphate groups
(Figure 2.30). ATP is classified as a high energy compound because the two covalent bonds linking its three phosphates
store a significant amount of potential energy. In the body, the energy released from these high energy bonds helps fuel the
body’s activities, from muscle contraction to the transport of substances in and out of cells to anabolic chemical reactions.
