Most water and solutes are recovered by this second capillary bed. This filtrate is processed and finally gathered
by collecting ducts that drain into the minor calyces, which merge to form major calyces; the filtrate then proceeds to the
renal pelvis and finally the ureters.

 25.4 Microscopic Anatomy of the Kidney

The functional unit of the kidney, the nephron, consists of the renal corpuscle, PCT, loop of Henle, and DCT. Cortica
nephrons have short loops of Henle, whereas juxtamedullary nephrons have long loops of Henle extending into the medulla.
 About 15 percent of nephrons are juxtamedullary. The glomerulus is a capillary bed that filters blood principally based on
particle size. The filtrate is captured by Bowmanâ€™s capsule and directed to the PCT. A filtration membrane is formed by the
fused basement membranes of the podocytes and the capillary endothelial cells that they embrace. Contractile mesangial
cells further perform a role in regulating the rate at which the blood is filtered.
