The Cranial Nerves The anatomical arrangement of the roots of the cranial nerves observed from an
inferior view of the brain.

 Three of the cranial nerves also contain autonomic fibers, and a fourth is almost purely a component of the autonomic
system. The oculomotor, facial, and glossopharyngeal nerves contain fibers that contact autonomic ganglia. The oculomotor
fibers initiate pupillary constriction, whereas the facial and glossopharyngeal fibers both initiate salivation. The vagus nerve
primarily targets autonomic ganglia in the thoracic and upper abdominal cavities.

Visit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/NYTmeningitis) to read about a man who wakes with a headache and
a loss of vision. His regular doctor sent him to an ophthalmologist to address the vision loss. The ophthalmologist
recognizes a greater problem and immediately sends him to the emergency room. Once there, the patient undergoes a
large battery of tests, but a definite cause cannot be found.
