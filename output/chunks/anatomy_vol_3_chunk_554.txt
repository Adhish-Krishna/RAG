This loss of conformation may be a consequence of the breaking of hydrogen bonds. Move the pH away from the optimum
for a specific enzyme and you may severely hamper its function throughout the body, including hormone binding, central
nervous system signaling, or myocardial contraction. Proper kidney function is essential for pH homeostasis.

Stem Cells and Repair of Kidney Damage

Stem cells are unspecialized cells that can reproduce themselves via cell division, sometimes after years of inactivity.
 Under certain conditions, they may differentiate into tissue-specific or organ-specific cells with special functions. In
some cases, stem cells may continually divide to produce a mature cell and to replace themselves. Stem cell therapy
has an enormous potential to improve the quality of life or save the lives of people suffering from debilitating or life-
threatening diseases. There have been several studies in animals, but since stem cell therapy is still in its infancy, there
have been limited experiments in humans.
