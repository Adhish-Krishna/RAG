21.6 | Diseases Associated with Depressed or Overactive
Immune Responses

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Discuss inherited and acquired immunodeficiencies
¢ Explain the four types of hypersensitivity and how they differ
* Give an example of how autoimmune disease breaks tolerance

This section is about how the immune system goes wrong. When it goes haywire, and becomes too weak or too strong, it
leads to a state of disease. The factors that maintain immunological homeostasis are complex and incompletely understood.
