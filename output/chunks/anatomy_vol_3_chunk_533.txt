It does so by stimulating the movement of
aquaporin proteins into the apical cell membrane of principal cells of the collecting ducts to form water channels, allowing
the transcellular movement of water from the lumen of the collecting duct into the interstitial space in the medulla of the
kidney by osmosis. From there, it enters the vasa recta capillaries to return to the circulation. Water is attracted by the high
osmotic environment of the deep kidney medulla.

 Endothelin

Endothelins, 21-amino acid peptides, are extremely powerful vasoconstrictors. They are produced by endothelial cells of
the renal blood vessels, mesangial cells, and cells of the DCT. Hormones stimulating endothelin release include angiotensin
I, bradykinin, and epinephrine. They do not typically influence blood pressure in healthy people. On the other hand, in
people with diabetic kidney disease, endothelin is chronically elevated, resulting in sodium retention. They also diminish
GER by damaging the podocytes and by potently vasoconstricting both the afferent and efferent arterioles.
