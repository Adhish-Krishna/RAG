As more Tc cells are developed

946 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM

during an immune response, they overwhelm the ability of the virus to cause disease. In addition, each Tc cell can kill more
than one target cell, making them especially effective. Tc cells are so important in the antiviral immune response that some
speculate that this was the main reason the adaptive immune response evolved in the first place.

 Regulatory T Cells

Regulatory T cells (Treg), or suppressor T cells, are the most recently discovered of the types listed here, so less is
understood about them. In addition to CD4, they bear the molecules CD25 and FOXP3. Exactly how they function is still
under investigation, but it is known that they suppress other T cell immune responses. This is an important feature of
the immune response, because if clonal expansion during immune responses were allowed to continue uncontrolled, these
responses could lead to autoimmune diseases and other medical issues.
