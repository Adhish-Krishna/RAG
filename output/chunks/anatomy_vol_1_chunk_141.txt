A
second shell is necessary to hold the electrons in all elements larger than hydrogen and helium.

 Lithium (Li), whose atomic number is 3, has three electrons. Two of these fill the first electron shell, and the third
spills over into a second shell. The second electron shell can accommodate as many as eight electrons. Carbon, with its six
electrons, entirely fills its first shell, and half-fills its second. With ten electrons, neon (Ne) entirely fills its two electron
shells. Again, a look at the periodic table reveals that all of the elements in the second row, from lithium to neon, have just
two electron shells. Atoms with more than ten electrons require more than two shells. These elements occupy the third and

subsequent rows of the periodic table.
