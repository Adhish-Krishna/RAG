[he medial compartment includes the adductors, pectineus, and the gracilis. The anterior compartment comprises the
quadriceps femoris, quadriceps tendon, patellar ligament, and the sartorius. The quadriceps femoris is made of four muscles:
the rectus femoris, the vastus lateralis, the vastus medius, and the vastus intermedius, which together extend the knee. The
posterior compartment of the thigh includes the hamstrings: the biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and the semimembranosus,
which all flex the knee.
 The muscles of the leg that move the foot and toes are divided into anterior, lateral, superficial- and deep-posterior
compartments. The anterior compartment includes the tibialis anterior, the extensor hallucis longus, the extensor digitorum
longus, and the fibularis (peroneus) tertius. The lateral compartment houses the fibularis (peroneus) longus and the
fibularis (peroneus) brevis. The superficial posterior compartment has the gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris; and the deep
posterior compartment has the popliteus, tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus, and flexor hallucis longus.
