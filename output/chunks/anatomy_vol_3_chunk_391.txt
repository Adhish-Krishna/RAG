Once inside these cells, glucose is immediately converted into glucose-6-phosphate. By doing this, a concentration
gradient is established where glucose levels are higher in the blood than in the cells. This allows for glucose to continue
moving from the blood to the cells where it is needed. Insulin also stimulates the storage of glucose as glycogen in the liver
and muscle cells where it can be used for later energy needs of the body. Insulin also promotes the synthesis of protein in
muscle. As you will see, muscle protein can be catabolized and used as fuel in times of starvation.

 If energy is exerted shortly after eating, the dietary fats and sugars that were just ingested will be processed and used
immediately for energy. If not, the excess glucose is stored as glycogen in the liver and muscle cells, or as fat in adipose
tissue; excess dietary fat is also stored as triglycerides in adipose tissues.
