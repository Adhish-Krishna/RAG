It has a 10-fold lower affinity for its receptor, so its effects are less than those of ANH. Its role may be to
provide “fine tuning” for the regulation of blood pressure. BNP’s longer biologic half-life makes it a good diagnostic marker
of congestive heart failure (Figure 25.21).

 Parathyroid Hormone

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is an 84-amino acid peptide produced by the parathyroid glands in response to decreased
circulating Ca** levels. Among its targets is the PCT, where it stimulates the hydroxylation of calcidiol to calcitriol

(1,25-hydroxycholecalciferol, the active form of vitamin D). It also blocks reabsorption of phosphate (PO3 ), causing its
loss in the urine. The retention of phosphate would result in the formation of calcium phosphate in the plasma, reducing

circulating Ca** levels. By ridding the blood of phosphate, higher circulating Ca** levels are permitted.
