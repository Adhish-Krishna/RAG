 Figure 17.17 Adrenal Glands Both adrenal glands sit atop the kidneys and are composed of an outer cortex and an
inner medulla, all surrounded by a connective tissue capsule. The cortex can be subdivided into additional zones, all of
which produce different types of hormones. LM x 204. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan

in greater detail.

 The adrenal gland consists of an outer cortex of glandular tissue and an inner medulla of nervous tissue. The cortex
itself is divided into three zones: the zona glomerulosa, the zona fasciculata, and the zona reticularis. Each region secretes
its own set of hormones.

 The adrenal cortex, as a component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, secretes steroid hormones
important for the regulation of the long-term stress response, blood pressure and blood volume, nutrient uptake and
storage, fluid and electrolyte balance, and inflammation.
