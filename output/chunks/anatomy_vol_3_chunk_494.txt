GFR can be estimated closely by intravenous administration of inulin. Inulin is a plant
polysaccharide that is neither reabsorbed nor secreted by the kidney. Its appearance in the urine is directly proportional
to the rate at which it is filtered by the renal corpuscle. However, since measuring inulin clearance is cumbersome in the
clinical setting, most often, the GFR is estimated by measuring naturally occurring creatinine, a protein-derived molecule
produced by muscle metabolism that is not reabsorbed and only slightly secreted by the nephron.

 By the end of this section, you will be able to:

¢ List specific transport mechanisms occurring in different parts of the nephron, including active transport, osmosis,
‘acilitated diffusion, and passive electrochemical gradients

¢ List the different membrane proteins of the nephron, including channels, transporters, and ATPase pumps
¢ Compare and contrast passive and active tubular reabsorption
