CHAPTER 28 | DEVELOPMENT AND INHERITANCE

Neural plate border Neural plate  Ectoderm

@ Neuroectodermal tissues differentiate from the
ectoderm and thicken into the neural plate. The
neural plate border separates the ectoderm
from the neural plate.

Neural crest ends eventually joining at the neural plate
borders, which are now referred to as the
neural crest.

 Ectoderm

® The closure of the neural tube disconnects the
neural crest from the epidermis. Neural crest
cells differentiate to form most of the peripheral

(6) The notochord degenerates and only persists as
the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs.
