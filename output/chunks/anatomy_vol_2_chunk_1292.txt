While the vessels are developing, the pluripotent stem cells begin to form the blood.

 Vascular tubes also develop on the blood islands, and they eventually connect to one another as well as to the
developing, tubular heart. Thus, the developmental pattern, rather than beginning from the formation of one central vessel
and spreading outward, occurs in many regions simultaneously with vessels later joining together. This angiogenesis—the
creation of new blood vessels from existing ones—continues as needed throughout life as we grow and develop.

 Blood vessel development often follows the same pattern as nerve development and travels to the same target tissues
and organs. This occurs because the many factors directing growth of nerves also stimulate blood vessels to follow a
similar pattern. Whether a given vessel develops into an artery or a vein is dependent upon local concentrations of signaling
proteins.

 As the embryo grows within the mother’s uterus, its requirements for nutrients and gas exchange also grow.
