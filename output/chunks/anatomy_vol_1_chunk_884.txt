In newborns and infants, the areas of connective tissue between the bones are much wider, especially in those areas on
the top and sides of the skull that will become the sagittal, coronal, squamous, and lambdoid sutures. These broad areas of
connective tissue are called fontanelles (Figure 9.6). During birth, the fontanelles provide flexibility to the skull, allowing
the bones to push closer together or to overlap slightly, thus aiding movement of the infantâ€™s head through the birth canal.
 After birth, these expanded regions of connective tissue allow for rapid growth of the skull and enlargement of the brain.
 The fontanelles greatly decrease in width during the first year after birth as the skull bones enlarge. When the connective
tissue between the adjacent bones is reduced to a narrow layer, these fibrous joints are now called sutures. At some sutures,
the connective tissue will ossify and be converted into bone, causing the adjacent bones to fuse to each other.
