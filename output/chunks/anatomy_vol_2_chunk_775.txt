In addition, the drugs can
cause significant and dangerous side effects. For example, anabolic steroid use can increase cholesterol levels, raise
blood pressure, and damage the liver. Altered testosterone levels (both too low or too high) have been implicated in
causing structural damage to the heart, and increasing the risk for cardiac arrhythmias, heart attacks, congestive heart
failure, and sudden death. Paradoxically, steroids can have a feminizing effect in males, including shriveled testicles
and enlarged breast tissue. In females, their use can cause masculinizing effects such as an enlarged clitoris and growth
of facial hair. In both sexes, their use can promote increased aggression (commonly known as “roid-rage”), depression,
sleep disturbances, severe acne, and infertility.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the location and structure of the pancreas, and the morphology and function of the pancreatic islets
* Compare and contrast the functions of insulin and glucagon

The pancreas is a long, slender organ, most of which is located posterior to the bottom half of the stomach (Figure 17.18).
