Located at the opening between the left atrium and left ventricle is the mitral valve, also called the bicuspid valve

or the left atrioventricular valve. Structurally, this valve consists of two cusps, known as the anterior medial cusp and tl
posterior medial cusp, compared to the three cusps of the tricuspid valve. In a clinical setting, the valve is referred to

the mitral valve, rather than the bicuspid valve. The two cusps of the mitral valve are attached by chordae tendineae to two

papillary muscles that project from the wall of the ventricle.

 At the base of the aorta is the aortic semilunar valve, or the aortic valve, which prevents backflow from the aorta.
 normally is composed of three flaps. When the ventricle relaxes and blood attempts to flow back into the ventricle from t
aorta, blood will fill the cusps of the valve, causing it to close and producing an audible sound.

In Figure 19.13a, the two atrioventricular valves are open and the two semilunar valves are closed.
