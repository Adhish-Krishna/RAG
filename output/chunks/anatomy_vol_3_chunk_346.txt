Each 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is subsequently dephosphorylated (i.e., a phosphate is removed) by phosphoglycerate
kinase into 3-phosphoglycerate. Each phosphate released in this reaction can convert one molecule of ADP into one high-
energy ATP molecule, resulting in a gain of two ATP molecules.

 The enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase then converts the 3-phosphoglycerate molecules into 2-phosphoglycerate. The
enolase enzyme then acts upon the 2-phosphoglycerate molecules to convert them into phosphoenolpyruvate molecules.
 The last step of glycolysis involves the dephosphorylation of the two phosphoenolpyruvate molecules by pyruvate kinase
to create two pyruvate molecules and two ATP molecules.

 In summary, one glucose molecule breaks down into two pyruvate molecules, and creates two net ATP molecules and
two NADH molecules by glycolysis. Therefore, glycolysis generates energy for the cell and creates pyruvate molecules
that can be processed further through the aerobic Krebs cycle (also called the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid

gluconeogenesis.
