 Right Atrium

The right atrium serves as the receiving chamber for blood returning to the heart from the systemic circulation. The two
major systemic veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae, and the large coronary vein called the coronary sinus that
drains the heart myocardium empty into the right atrium. The superior vena cava drains blood from regions superior to the
diaphragm: the head, neck, upper limbs, and the thoracic region. It empties into the superior and posterior portions of the
right atrium. The inferior vena cava drains blood from areas inferior to the diaphragm: the lower limbs and abdominopelvic
region of the body.
