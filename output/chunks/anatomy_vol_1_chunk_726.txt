However, growth, remodeling, and ossification
(bone formation) continue for several decades after birth before the adult skeleton is fully formed. Knowledge of the
developmental processes that give rise to the skeleton is important for understanding the abnormalities that may arise in
skeletal structures.

 Development of the Skull

During the third week of embryonic development, a rod-like structure called the notochord develops dorsally along the
length of the embryo. The tissue overlying the notochord enlarges and forms the neural tube, which will give rise to the
brain and spinal cord. By the fourth week, mesoderm tissue located on either side of the notochord thickens and separates
into a repeating series of block-like tissue structures, each of which is called a somite. As the somites enlarge, each one
