Total pressure is the sum of all the partial pressures of a gaseous mixture.
 Dalton’s law describes the behavior of nonreactive gases in a gaseous mixture and states that a specific gas type in a mixture
exerts its own pressure; thus, the total pressure exerted by a mixture of gases is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases
in the mixture.
