would lose their integrity during powerful movements, resulting in muscle damage. 32 When a muscle contracts, the force of
movement is transmitted through the tendon, which pulls on the bone to produce skeletal movement. 33 Produce movement of the
skeleton, maintain posture and body position, support soft tissues, encircle openings of the digestive, urinary, and other tracts, and

maintain body temperature. 34 The opening of voltage-gated sodium channels, followed by the influx of Naâ€™, transmits an Action

Potential after the membrane has sufficiently depolarized. The delayed opening of potassium channels allows K* to exit the cell,
to repolarize the membrane. 35 Without T-tubules, action potential conduction into the interior of the cell would happen much
more slowly, causing delays between neural stimulation and muscle contraction, resulting in slower, weaker contractions.
