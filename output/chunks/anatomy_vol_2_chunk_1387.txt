Clonal selection is the process of antigen binding only to those T cells that have receptors specific to that antigen.
 Each T cell that is activated has a specific receptor “hard-wired” into its DNA, and all of its progeny will have identical
DNA and T cell receptors, forming clones of the original T cell.

receptors, called clones. The clones with receptors specific for antigens on the pathogen are selected for and
expanded.

 Clonal Selection and Expansion

The clonal selection theory was proposed by Frank Burnet in the 1950s.
