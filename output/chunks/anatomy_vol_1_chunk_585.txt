The longitudinal growth of bone is a result of cellular division in
the proliferative zone and the maturation of cells in the zone of maturation and hypertrophy.

 Most of the chondrocytes in the zone of calcified matrix, the zone closest to the diaphysis, are dead because the matrix
around them has calcified. Capillaries and osteoblasts from the diaphysis penetrate this zone, and the osteoblasts secrete
bone tissue on the remaining calcified cartilage. Thus, the zone of calcified matrix connects the epiphyseal plate to the
diaphysis. A bone grows in length when osseous tissue is added to the diaphysis.

 Bones continue to grow in length until early adulthood. The rate of growth is controlled by hormones, which will be
discussed later. When the chondrocytes in the epiphyseal plate cease their proliferation and bone replaces the cartilage,
longitudinal growth stops. All that remains of the epiphyseal plate is the epiphyseal line (Figure 6.19).
