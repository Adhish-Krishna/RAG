If the temperature is too high, the hypothalamus can initiate several processes to lower it. These include
increasing the circulation of the blood to the surface of the body to allow for the dissipation of heat through the skin and
initiation of sweating to allow evaporation of water on the skin to cool its surface. Conversely, if the temperature falls
below the set core temperature, the hypothalamus can initiate shivering to generate heat. The body uses more energy and
generates more heat. In addition, thyroid hormone will stimulate more energy use and heat production by cells throughout
the body. An environment is said to be thermoneutral when the body does not expend or release energy to maintain its
core temperature. For a naked human, this is an ambient air temperature of around 84 Â°F. If the temperature is higher,
for example, when wearing clothes, the body compensates with cooling mechanisms. The body loses heat through the
mechanisms of heat exchange.
