The mineralocorticoids, chiefly aldosterone, cause
sodium and fluid retention, which increases blood volume and blood pressure.

17.7 The Pineal Gland

The pineal gland is an endocrine structure of the diencephalon of the brain, and is located inferior and posterior to the
thalamus. It is made up of pinealocytes. These cells produce and secrete the hormone melatonin in response to low light
levels. High blood levels of melatonin induce drowsiness. Jet lag, caused by traveling across several time zones, occurs
because melatonin synthesis takes several days to readjust to the light-dark patterns in the new environment.

 17.8 Gonadal and Placental Hormones

The male and female reproductive system is regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone
(LH) produced by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the
hypothalamus.
