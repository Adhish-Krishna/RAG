Pathways Involving Cell Membrane Hormone Receptors

Hydrophilic, or water-soluble, hormones are unable to diffuse through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane and must
therefore pass on their message to a receptor located at the surface of the cell. Except for thyroid hormones, which are
lipid-soluble, all amino acidâ€”derived hormones bind to cell membrane receptors that are located, at least in part, on the
extracellular surface of the cell membrane. Therefore, they do not directly affect the transcription of target genes, but instead
initiate a signaling cascade that is carried out by a molecule called a second messenger. In this case, the hormone is called
a first messenger.

 The second messenger used by most hormones is cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). In the cAMP second
messenger system, a water-soluble hormone binds to its receptor in the cell membrane (Step 1 in Figure 17.5).
