CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS

32. Darcy and Raul are having difficulty conceiving a child.
 Darcy ovulates every 28 days, and Raul’s sperm count is
normal. If we could observe Raul’s sperm about an hour
after ejaculation, however, we’d see that they appear to be
moving only sluggishly. When Raul’s sperm eventually
encounter Darcy’s oocyte, they appear to be incapable of
generating an adequate acrosomal reaction. Which process
has probably gone wrong?

Saturday night, she has unprotected sex with her boyfriend.
 On Tuesday morning, she experiences the twinge of mid-
