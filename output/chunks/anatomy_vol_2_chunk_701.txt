Hormones that bind to this type of receptor must be able to cross
the cell membrane. Steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol and therefore can readily diffuse through the lipid bilayer
of the cell membrane to reach the intracellular receptor (Figure 17.4). Thyroid hormones, which contain benzene rings
studded with iodine, are also lipid-soluble and can enter the cell.

 The location of steroid and thyroid hormone binding differs slightly: a steroid hormone may bind to its receptor within
the cytosol or within the nucleus. In either case, this binding generates a hormone-receptor complex that moves toward
the chromatin in the cell nucleus and binds to a particular segment of the cellâ€™s DNA. In contrast, thyroid hormones bind
to receptors already bound to DNA. For both steroid and thyroid hormones, binding of the hormone-receptor complex
with DNA triggers transcription of a target gene to mRNA, which moves to the cytosol and directs protein synthesis by
ribosomes.
