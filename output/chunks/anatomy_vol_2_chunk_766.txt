Derived from the amino acid
tyrosine, they are chemically classified as catecholamines.

 The secretion of medullary epinephrine and norepinephrine is controlled by a neural pathway that originates from the
hypothalamus in response to danger or stress (the SAM pathway). Both epinephrine and norepinephrine signal the liver and
skeletal muscle cells to convert glycogen into glucose, resulting in increased blood glucose levels. These hormones increase
the heart rate, pulse, and blood pressure to prepare the body to fight the perceived threat or flee from it. In addition, the
pathway dilates the airways, raising blood oxygen levels. It also prompts vasodilation, further increasing the oxygenation
of important organs such as the lungs, brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. At the same time, it triggers vasoconstriction to
blood vessels serving less essential organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and skin, and downregulates some
components of the immune system.
