Figure 28.11 Cross-Section of the Placenta In the placenta, maternal and fetal blood components are conducted
through the surface of the chorionic villi, but maternal and fetal bloodstreams never mix directly.

 The placenta develops throughout the embryonic period and during the first several weeks of the fetal period;
placentation is complete by weeks 14-16. As a fully developed organ, the placenta provides nutrition and excretion,
respiration, and endocrine function (Table 28.1 and Figure 28.12). It receives blood from the fetus through the umbilical
arteries. Capillaries in the chorionic villi filter fetal wastes out of the blood and return clean, oxygenated blood to the fetus
through the umbilical vein. Nutrients and oxygen are transferred from maternal blood surrounding the villi through the
capillaries and into the fetal bloodstream.
