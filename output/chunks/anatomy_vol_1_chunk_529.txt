These are serious
burns that may appear white, red, or black; they require medical attention and will heal slowly without it. A fourth-degree
burn is even more severe, affecting the underlying muscle and bone. Oddly, third and fourth-degree burns are usually not
as painful because the nerve endings themselves are damaged. Full-thickness burns cannot be repaired by the body, because
the local tissues used for repair are damaged and require excision (debridement), or amputation in severe cases, followed
by grafting of the skin from an unaffected part of the body, or from skin grown in tissue culture for grafting purposes.
