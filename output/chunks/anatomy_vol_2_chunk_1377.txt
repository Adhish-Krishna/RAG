(0) A pathogen or extracellular antigen is
phagocytized by an antigen-presenting
cell (dendritic cell here) and placed into
a vesicle. Ingested pathogens are
digested by lysosomes to extract their
antigens.

 Figure 21.17 Antigen Processing and Presentation

Two distinct types of MHC molecules, MHC class I and MHC class II, play roles in antigen presentation. Although
produced from different genes, they both have similar functions. They bring processed antigen to the surface of the cell
via a transport vesicle and present the antigen to the T cell and its receptor.
