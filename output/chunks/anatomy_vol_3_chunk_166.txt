In contrast, parasympathetic activation (the rest-
and-digest response) increases GI secretion and motility by stimulating neurons of the enteric nervous system.

 Blood Supply

The blood vessels serving the digestive system have two functions. They transport the protein and carbohydrate nutrients
absorbed by mucosal cells after food is digested in the lumen. Lipids are absorbed via lacteals, tiny structures of the
lymphatic system. The blood vesselsâ€™ second function is to supply the organs of the alimentary canal with the nutrients and
oxygen needed to drive their cellular processes.

 Specifically, the more anterior parts of the alimentary canal are supplied with blood by arteries branching off the
aortic arch and thoracic aorta. Below this point, the alimentary canal is supplied with blood by arteries branching from the
abdominal aorta. The celiac trunk services the liver, stomach, and duodenum, whereas the superior and inferior mesenteric
arteries supply blood to the remaining small and large intestines.
