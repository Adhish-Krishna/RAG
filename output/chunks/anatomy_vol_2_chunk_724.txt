The more water reabsorbed from the filtrate, the greater the amount of water that is returned to the blood

and the less that is excreted in the urine. A greater concentration of water results in a reduced concentration of solutes.
 ADH is also known as vasopressin because, in very high concentrations, it causes constriction of blood vessels, which
increases blood pressure by increasing peripheral resistance. The release of ADH is controlled by a negative feedback loop.
 As blood osmolarity decreases, the hypothalamic osmoreceptors sense the change and prompt a corresponding decrease in
the secretion of ADH. As a result, less water is reabsorbed from the urine filtrate.

 Interestingly, drugs can affect the secretion of ADH. For example, alcohol consumption inhibits the release of ADH,
resulting in increased urine production that can eventually lead to dehydration and a hangover. A disease called diabetes
insipidus is characterized by chronic underproduction of ADH that causes chronic dehydration.
