At sea level, there is a
large amount of oxygen reserve in venous blood (even though venous blood is thought of as “deoxygenated”) from which
the muscles can draw during physical exertion. Because the oxygen saturation is much lower at higher altitudes, this venous
reserve is small, resulting in pathological symptoms of low blood oxygen levels. You may have heard that it is important
to drink more water when traveling at higher altitudes than you are accustomed to. This is because your body will increase
micturition (urination) at high altitudes to counteract the effects of lower oxygen levels. By removing fluids, blood plasma
levels drop but not the total number of erythrocytes. In this way, the overall concentration of erythrocytes in the blood
increases, which helps tissues obtain the oxygen they need.

 Acute mountain sickness (AMS), or altitude sickness, is a condition that results from acute exposure to high altitudes
due to a low partial pressure of oxygen at high altitudes.
