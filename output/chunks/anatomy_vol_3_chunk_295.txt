The small intestine is highly efficient at this, absorbing
monosaccharides at an estimated rate of 120 grams per hour. All normally digested dietary carbohydrates are absorbed;
indigestible fibers are eliminated in the feces. The monosaccharides glucose and galactose are transported into the
epithelial cells by common protein carriers via secondary active transport (that is, co-transport with sodium ions). The
monosaccharides leave these cells via facilitated diffusion and enter the capillaries through intercellular clefts. The
monosaccharide fructose (which is in fruit) is absorbed and transported by facilitated diffusion alone. The monosaccharides
combine with the transport proteins immediately after the disaccharides are broken down.

 Protein Absorption

Active transport mechanisms, primarily in the duodenum and jejunum, absorb most proteins as their breakdown products,
amino acids. Almost all (95 to 98 percent) protein is digested and absorbed in the small intestine. The type of carrier that
transports an amino acid varies. Most carriers are linked to the active transport of sodium.
