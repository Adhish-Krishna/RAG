Artery walls that are constantly stressed
by blood flowing at high pressure are also more likely to be injured—which means that hypertension can promote
arteriosclerosis, as well as result from it.

 Recall that tissue injury causes inflammation. As inflammation spreads into the artery wall, it weakens and scars
it, leaving it stiff (sclerotic). As a result, compliance is reduced. Moreover, circulating triglycerides and cholesterol can
seep between the damaged lining cells and become trapped within the artery wall, where they are frequently joined by
leukocytes, calcium, and cellular debris. Eventually, this buildup, called plaque, can narrow arteries enough to impair
blood flow. The term for this condition, atherosclerosis (athero- = “porridge”) describes the mealy deposits (Figure
20.14).
