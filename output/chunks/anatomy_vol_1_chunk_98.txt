The disadvantage of irradiation to the patient and the
operator is now attenuated by proper shielding and by limiting exposure.

 Modern Medical Imaging

X-rays can depict a two-dimensional image of a body region, and only from a single angle. In contrast, more recent medical
imaging technologies produce data that is integrated and analyzed by computers to produce three-dimensional images or
images that reveal aspects of body functioning.

Computed Tomography

Tomography refers to imaging by sections. Computed tomography (CT) is a noninvasive imaging technique that uses
computers to analyze several cross-sectional X-rays in order to reveal minute details about structures in the body (Figure
1.19a). The technique was invented in the 1970s and is based on the principle that, as X-rays pass through the body, they
are absorbed or reflected at different levels.
