When blood
leaving an arteriole first enters a capillary bed, the CHP is quite high—about 35 mm Hg. Gradually, this initial CHP declines
as the blood moves through the capillary so that by the time the blood has reached the venous end, the CHP has dropped
to approximately 18 mm Hg. In comparison, the plasma proteins remain suspended in the blood, so the BCOP remains
‘airly constant at about 25 mm Hg throughout the length of the capillary and considerably below the osmotic pressure in the
interstitial fluid.

 The net filtration pressure (NFP) represents the interaction of the hydrostatic and osmotic pressures, driving fluid out
of the capillary. It is equal to the difference between the CHP and the BCOP. Since filtration is, by definition, the movement
of fluid out of the capillary, when reabsorption is occurring, the NFP is a negative number.
