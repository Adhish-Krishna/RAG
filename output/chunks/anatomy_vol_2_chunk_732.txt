TSH
is released from the anterior pituitary in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus. As
discussed shortly, it triggers the secretion of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland. In a classic negative feedback loop,
elevated levels of thyroid hormones in the bloodstream then trigger a drop in production of TRH and subsequently TSH.

 Adrenocorticotropic Hormone

The adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), also called corticotropin, stimulates the adrenal cortex (the more superficial
“bark” of the adrenal glands) to secrete corticosteroid hormones such as cortisol. ACTH come from a precursor molecule

known as pro-opiomelanotropin (POMC) which produces several biologically active molecules when cleaved, including
ACTH, melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and the brain opioid peptides known as endorphins.
