Scoliosis is the most common vertebral abnormality among girls. The cause is usually unknown, but it may result
from weakness of the back muscles, defects such as differential growth rates in the right and left sides of the vertebral
column, or differences in the length of the lower limbs. When present, scoliosis tends to get worse during adolescent
growth spurts. Although most individuals do not require treatment, a back brace may be recommended for growing
children. In extreme cases, surgery may be required.

 Excessive vertebral curves can be identified while an individual stands in the anatomical position. Observe the
vertebral profile from the side and then from behind to check for kyphosis or lordosis. Then have the person bend
forward. If scoliosis is present, an individual will have difficulty in bending directly forward, and the right and left
sides of the back will not be level with each other in the bent position.
