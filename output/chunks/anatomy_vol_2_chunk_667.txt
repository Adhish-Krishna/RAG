Input to the muscles comes from the descending cortical input of
upper motor neurons and the direct innervation of lower motor neurons.

 Reflexes can either be based on deep stimulation of tendons or superficial stimulation of the skin. The presence of
reflexive contractions helps to differentiate motor disorders between the upper and lower motor neurons. The specific signs
associated with motor disorders can establish the difference further, based on the type of paralysis, the state of muscle tone,
and specific indicators such as pronator drift or the Babinski sign.

 16.5 The Coordination and Gait Exams

The cerebellum is an important part of motor function in the nervous system. It apparently plays a role in procedural
learning, which would include motor skills such as riding a bike or throwing a football. The basis for these roles is likely to
be tied into the role the cerebellum plays as a comparator for voluntary movement.

 The motor commands from the cerebral hemispheres travel along the corticospinal pathway, which passes through
the pons.
