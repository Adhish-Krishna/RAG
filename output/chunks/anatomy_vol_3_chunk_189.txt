Those who stake this claim cite its
strength proportionate to its size. Although it is difficult to quantify the relative strength of different muscles, it remains
indisputable that the tongue is a workhorse, facilitating ingestion, mechanical digestion, chemical digestion (lingual lipase),
sensation (of taste, texture, and temperature of food), swallowing, and vocalization.
 The tongue is attached to the mandible, the styloid processes of the temporal bones, and the hyoid bone. The hyoid
is unique in that it only distantly/indirectly articulates with other bones. The tongue is positioned over the floor of the oral
cavity. A medial septum extends the entire length of the tongue, dividing it into symmetrical halves.
 Beneath its mucous membrane covering, each half of the tongue is composed of the same number and type of intrinsic
and extrinsic skeletal muscles. The intrinsic muscles (those within the tongue) are the longitudinalis inferior, longitudinalis
superior, transversus linguae, and verticalis linguae muscles.
