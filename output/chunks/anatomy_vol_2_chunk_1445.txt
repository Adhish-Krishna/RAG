Figure 21.30 Erythroblastosis Fetalis Erythroblastosis fetalis (hemolytic disease of the newborn) is the result of
an immune response in an Rh-negative mother who has multiple children with an Rh-positive father. During the first
birth, fetal blood enters the mother’s circulatory system, and anti-Rh antibodies are made. During the gestation of the
second child, these antibodies cross the placenta and attack the blood of the fetus. The treatment for this disease is
to give the mother anti-Rh antibodies (RhoGAM) during the first pregnancy to destroy Rh-positive fetal red blood cells
from entering her system and causing the anti-Rh antibody response in the first place.
