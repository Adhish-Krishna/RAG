The skin acts as a sense organ because the epidermis, dermis, and the hypodermis contain specialized sensory nerve
structures that detect touch, surface temperature, and pain. These receptors are more concentrated on the tips of the fingers,
which are most sensitive to touch, especially the Meissner corpuscle (tactile corpuscle) (Figure 5.15), which responds to
light touch, and the Pacinian corpuscle (lamellated corpuscle), which responds to vibration. Merkel cells, seen scattered in
the stratum basale, are also touch receptors. In addition to these specialized receptors, there are sensory nerves connected to
each hair follicle, pain and temperature receptors scattered throughout the skin, and motor nerves innervate the arrector pili
muscles and glands. This rich innervation helps us sense our environment and react accordingly.

 Figure 5.15 Light Micrograph of a Meissneer Corpuscle In this micrograph of a skin cross-section, you can see a
Meissner corpuscle (arrow), a type of touch receptor located in a dermal papilla adjacent to the basement membrane
and stratum basale of the overlying epidermis.
