Phosphate levels move in the opposite direction. When
Ca** levels are low, PTH inhibits reabsorption of HPO} ~ so that its blood level drops, allowing Ca*~ levels to rise. PTH
also stimulates the renal conversion of calcidiol into calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D. Calcitriol then stimulates the

intestines to absorb more Caâ€˜ from the diet.

Regulation of H*, Bicarbonate, and pH

The acid-base homeostasis of the body is a function of chemical buffers and physiologic buffering provided by the lungs

and kidneys. Buffers, especially proteins, HCO3 ~ , and ammonia have a very large capacity to absorb or release H* as

needed to resist a change in pH. They can act within fractions of a second.
