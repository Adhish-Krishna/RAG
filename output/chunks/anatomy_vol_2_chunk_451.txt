It is referred to as the thoracolumbar system to
reflect this anatomical basis. A central neuron in the lateral horn of any of these spinal regions projects to ganglia adjacent
to the vertebral column through the ventral spinal roots. The majority of ganglia of the sympathetic system belong to a
network of sympathetic chain ganglia that runs alongside the vertebral column. The ganglia appear as a series of clusters
of neurons linked by axonal bridges. There are typically 23 ganglia in the chain on either side of the spinal column. Three
correspond to the cervical region, 12 are in the thoracic region, four are in the lumbar region, and four correspond to the
sacral region. The cervical and sacral levels are not connected to the spinal cord directly through the spinal roots, but through
ascending or descending connections through the bridges within the chain.

 A diagram that shows the connections of the sympathetic system is somewhat like a circuit diagram that shows the
electrical connections between different receptacles and devices.
