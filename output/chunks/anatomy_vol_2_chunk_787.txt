Uncontrolled diabetes can
also lead to a dangerous form of metabolic acidosis called ketoacidosis. Deprived of glucose, cells increasingly rely
on fat stores for fuel. However, in a glucose-deficient state, the liver is forced to use an alternative lipid metabolism
pathway that results in the increased production of ketone bodies (or ketones), which are acidic. The build-up of
ketones in the blood causes ketoacidosis, which—if left untreated—may lead to a life-threatening “diabetic coma.”
 Together, these complications make diabetes the seventh leading cause of death in the United States.

Diabetes is diagnosed when lab tests reveal that blood glucose levels are higher than normal, a condition called
hyperglycemia. The treatment of diabetes depends on the type, the severity of the condition, and the ability of the
patient to make lifestyle changes. As noted earlier, moderate weight loss, regular physical activity, and consumption
of a healthful diet can reduce blood glucose levels.
