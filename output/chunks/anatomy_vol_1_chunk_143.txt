If the
valence shell is not full, the atom is reactive; meaning it will tend to react with other atoms in ways that make the valence
shell full. Consider hydrogen, with its one electron only half-filling its valence shell. This single electron is likely to be
drawn into relationships with the atoms of other elements, so that hydrogen’s single valence shell can be stabilized.

 All atoms (except hydrogen and helium with their single electron shells) are most stable when there are exactly eight
electrons in their valence shell. This principle is referred to as the octet rule, and it states that an atom will give up, gain,
or share electrons with another atom so that it ends up with eight electrons in its own valence shell. For example, oxygen,
with six electrons in its valence shell, is likely to react with other atoms in a way that results in the addition of two electrons
to oxygen’s valence shell, bringing the number to eight.
