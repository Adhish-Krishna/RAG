These serve to resist excess forward or backward bending movements of the vertebral column,
respectively.

 The anterior longitudinal ligament runs down the anterior side of the entire vertebral column, uniting the vertebral
bodies. It serves to resist excess backward bending of the vertebral column. Protection against this movement is particularly
important in the neck, where extreme posterior bending of the head and neck can stretch or tear this ligament, resulting in a
painful whiplash injury. Prior to the mandatory installation of seat headrests, whiplash injuries were common for passengers
involved in a rear-end automobile collision.

 The supraspinous ligament is located on the posterior side of the vertebral column, where it interconnects the spinous
processes of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. This strong ligament supports the vertebral column during forward bending
motions. In the posterior neck, where the cervical spinous processes are short, the supraspinous ligament expands to become
the nuchal ligament (nuchae =
