Without
checking the contraction, the mug would be thrown from the overexertion of the muscles expecting to lift a heavier object.

 Several subtests of the cerebellum assess the ability to alternate movements, or switch between muscle groups that may
be antagonistic to each other. In the finger-to-nose test, the patient touches their finger to the examiner’s finger and then to
their nose, and then back to the examiner’s finger, and back to the nose. The examiner moves the target finger to assess a
range of movements. A similar test for the lower extremities has the patient touch their toe to a moving target, such as the
examiner’s finger. Both of these tests involve flexion and extension around a joint—the elbow or the knee and the shoulder
or hip—as well as movements of the wrist and ankle. The patient must switch between the opposing muscles, like the biceps
and triceps brachii, to move their finger from the target to their nose.
