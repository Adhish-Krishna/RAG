The resulting reduction in
circulating testosterone concentrations can lead to symptoms of andropause, also known as male menopause. While
the reduction in sex steroids in men is akin to female menopause, there is no clear sign—such as a lack of a
menstrual period—to denote the initiation of andropause. Instead, men report feelings of fatigue, reduced muscle
mass, depression, anxiety, irritability, loss of libido, and insomnia. A reduction in spermatogenesis resulting in lowered
fertility is also reported, and sexual dysfunction can also be associated with andropausal symptoms.

 Whereas some researchers believe that certain aspects of andropause are difficult to tease apart from aging in
general, testosterone replacement is sometimes prescribed to alleviate some symptoms. Recent studies have shown
a benefit from androgen replacement therapy on the new onset of depression in elderly men; however, other studies
caution against testosterone replacement for long-term treatment of andropause symptoms, showing that high doses
can sharply increase the risk of both heart disease and prostate cancer.
