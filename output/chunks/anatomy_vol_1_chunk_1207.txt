For one thing, walking would expend more energy if the heads of the femurs were not secured
in the acetabula of the pelvis. The body’s center of gravity is in the area of the pelvis. If the center of gravity were not to
remain fixed, standing up would be difficult as well. Therefore, what the leg muscles lack in range of motion and versatility,
they make up for in size and power, facilitating the body’s stabilization, posture, and movement.

 Gluteal Region Muscles That Move the Femur

Most muscles that insert on the femur (the thigh bone) and move it, originate on the pelvic girdle. The psoas major and
iliacus make up the iliopsoas group. Some of the largest and most powerful muscles in the body are the gluteal muscles
or gluteal group. The gluteus maximus is the largest; deep to the gluteus maximus is the gluteus medius, and deep to the
gluteus medius is the gluteus minimus, the smallest of the trio (Figure 11.29 and Figure 11.30).
