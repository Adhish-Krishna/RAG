A sudden drop in oxygenation can affect skin color, causing the
skin to initially turn ashen (white). With a prolonged reduction in oxygen levels, dark red deoxyhemoglobin becomes

“blue”). This happens when the oxygen supply is restricted, as when someone is experiencing difficulty in breathing
because of asthma or a heart attack. However, in these cases the effect on skin color has nothing do with the skin’s
