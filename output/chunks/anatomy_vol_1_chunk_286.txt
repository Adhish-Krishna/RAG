Eukaryotic cells, including all animal cells, also contain various
cellular organelles. An organelle (“little organ”) is one of several different types of membrane-enclosed bodies in the
cell, each performing a unique function. Just as the various bodily organs work together in harmony to perform all of a
human’s functions, the many different cellular organelles work together to keep the cell healthy and performing all of its
important functions. The organelles and cytosol, taken together, compose the cell’s cytoplasm. The nucleus is a cell’s
central organelle, which contains the cell’s DNA (Figure 3.13).
