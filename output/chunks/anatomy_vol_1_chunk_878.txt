Amphiarthrosis

 An amphiarthrosis is a joint that has limited mobility. An example of this type of joint is the cartilaginous joint that unites
the bodies of adjacent vertebrae. Filling the gap between the vertebrae is a thick pad of fibrocartilage called an intervertebral
disc (Figure 9.3). Each intervertebral disc strongly unites the vertebrae but still allows for a limited amount of movement
between them. However, the small movements available between adjacent vertebrae can sum together along the length of
the vertebral column to provide for large ranges of body movements.

 Another example of an amphiarthrosis is the pubic symphysis of the pelvis. This is a cartilaginous joint in which the
pubic regions of the right and left hip bones are strongly anchored to each other by fibrocartilage. This joint normally has
very little mobility. The strength of the pubic symphysis is important in conferring weight-bearing stability to the pelvis.
