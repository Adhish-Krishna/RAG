Dead cardiac muscle tissue
is replaced by scar tissue, which cannot contract. As scar tissue accumulates, the heart loses its ability to pump because
of the loss of contractile power. However, some minor regeneration may occur due to stem cells found in the blood that
occasionally enter cardiac tissue.

As muscle cells die, they are not regenerated but instead are replaced by connective tissue and adipose tissue, which do
not possess the contractile abilities of muscle tissue. Muscles atrophy when they are not used, and over time if atrophy
is prolonged, muscle cells die. It is therefore important that those who are susceptible to muscle atrophy exercise to
maintain muscle function and prevent the complete loss of muscle tissue. In extreme cases, when movement is not
possible, electrical stimulation can be introduced to a muscle from an external source. This acts as a substitute for
endogenous neural stimulation, stimulating the muscle to contract and preventing the loss of proteins that occurs with
a lack of use.
