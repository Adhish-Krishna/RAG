sperm deposited after they leave the ejaculatory duct?

 The Penis

The penis is the male organ of copulation (sexual intercourse). It is flaccid for non-sexual actions, such as urination, and
turgid and rod-like with sexual arousal. When erect, the stiffness of the organ allows it to penetrate into the vagina and
deposit semen into the female reproductive tract.

engorging corporal tissue

Engorging causes corporal tissue
to swell, erecting the penis

Â® Engorged corporal tissue compresses penile
veins and venules, maintaining erection
