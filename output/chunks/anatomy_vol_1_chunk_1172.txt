Perpendicular to it
is the intermediate internal oblique, extending superiorly and medially, the direction the thumbs usually go when the other
fingers are in the pants pocket. The deep muscle, the transversus abdominis, is arranged transversely around the abdomen,
similar to the front of a belt on a pair of pants. This arrangement of three bands of muscles in different orientations allows
various movements and rotations of the trunk. The three layers of muscle also help to protect the internal abdominal organs
in an area where there is no bone.

 The linea alba is a white, fibrous band that is made of the bilateral rectus sheaths that join at the anterior midline of the
body. These enclose the rectus abdominis muscles (a pair of long, linear muscles, commonly called the “sit-up” muscles)
that originate at the pubic crest and symphysis, and extend the length of the body’s trunk.
