This intermediate messenger is messenger
RNA (mRNA), a single-stranded nucleic acid that carries a copy of the genetic code for a single gene out of the nucleus
and into the cytoplasm where it is used to produce proteins.

 There are several different types of RNA, each having different functions in the cell. The structure of RNA is similar
to DNA with a few small exceptions. For one thing, unlike DNA, most types of RNA, including mRNA, are single-stranded
and contain no complementary strand. Second, the ribose sugar in RNA contains an additional oxygen atom compared with
DNA. Finally, instead of the base thymine, RNA contains the base uracil. This means that adenine will always pair up with
uracil during the protein synthesis process.

 Gene expression begins with the process called transcription, which is the synthesis of a strand of mRNA that is
complementary to the gene of interest.
