A division of the nervous system that is related to the autonomic nervous system is the enteric nervous system. The
word enteric refers to the digestive organs, so this represents the nervous tissue that is part of the digestive system. There
are a few myenteric plexuses in which the nervous tissue in the wall of the digestive tract organs can directly influence
digestive function. If stretch receptors in the stomach are activated by the filling and distension of the stomach, a short
reflex will directly activate the smooth muscle fibers of the stomach wall to increase motility to digest the excessive food
in the stomach. No CNS involvement is needed because the stretch receptor is directly activating a neuron in the wall of
the stomach that causes the smooth muscle to contract. That neuron, connected to the smooth muscle, is a postganglionic
parasympathetic neuron that can be controlled by a fiber found in the vagus nerve.
