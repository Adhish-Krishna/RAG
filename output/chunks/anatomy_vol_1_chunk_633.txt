The bones of the skeleton serve
as the primary storage site for important minerals such as calcium and phosphate. The bone marrow found within bones
stores fat and houses the blood-cell producing tissue of the body.

 The skeleton is subdivided into two major divisions—the axial and appendicular.

 The Axial Skeleton

The skeleton is subdivided into two major divisions—the axial and appendicular. The axial skeleton forms the vertical,
central axis of the body and includes all bones of the head, neck, chest, and back (Figure 7.2). It serves to protect the brain,
spinal cord, heart, and lungs. It also serves as the attachment site for muscles that move the head, neck, and back, and for
muscles that act across the shoulder and hip joints to move their corresponding limbs.

 The axial skeleton of the adult consists of 80 bones, including the skull, the vertebral column, and the thoracic cage.
