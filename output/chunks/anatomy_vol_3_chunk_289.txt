Nucleic Acid Digestion

The nucleic acids DNA and RNA are found in most of the foods you eat. Two types of pancreatic nuclease are
responsible for their digestion: deoxyribonuclease, which digests DNA, and ribonuclease, which digests RNA. The
nucleotides produced by this digestion are further broken down by two intestinal brush border enzymes ( nucleosidase and
phosphatase) into pentoses, phosphates, and nitrogenous bases, which can be absorbed through the alimentary canal wall.
 The large food molecules that must be broken down into subunits are summarized Table 23.9

Absorbable Food Substances

Source Substance

Carbohydrates | Monosaccharides: glucose, galactose, and fructose

Proteins Single amino acids, dipeptides, and tripeptides

Triglycerides |Monoacylglycerides, glycerol, and free fatty acids

Nucleic acids |Pentose sugars, phosphates, and nitrogenous bases

Absorption

The mechanical and digestive processes have one goal: to convert food into molecules small enough to be absorbed by
the epithelial cells of the intestinal villi.
