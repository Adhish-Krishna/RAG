Control centers in the brain play roles in regulating physiological parameters
and keeping them within the normal range. As the body works to maintain homeostasis, any significant deviation from the
normal range will be resisted and homeostasis restored through a process called negative feedback. Negative feedback is
a mechanism that prevents a physiological response from going beyond the normal range by reversing the action once the
normal range is exceeded. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all times,
and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.

 Negative Feedback

A negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a). A sensor, also referred to a receptor, is a
component of a feedback system that monitors a physiological value. This value is reported to the control center. The
control center is the component in a feedback system that compares the value to the normal range. If the value deviates too
much from the set point, then the control center activates an effector.
