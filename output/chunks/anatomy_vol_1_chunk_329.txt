tRNAs bring the appropriate amino acids in sequence to the
growing polypeptide chain by matching their anti-codons with codons on the MRNA strand.

Much like the processes of DNA replication and transcription, translation consists of three main stages: initiation,
elongation, and termination. Initiation takes place with the binding of a ribosome to an MRNA transcript. The elongation
stage involves the recognition of a tRNA anticodon with the next mRNA codon in the sequence. Once the anticodon and
codon sequences are bound (remember, they are complementary base pairs), the tRNA presents its amino acid cargo and the
growing polypeptide strand is attached to this next amino acid. This attachment takes place with the assistance of various
enzymes and requires energy. The tRNA molecule then releases the mRNA strand, the mRNA strand shifts one codon over
in the ribosome, and the next appropriate tRNA arrives with its matching anticodon.
