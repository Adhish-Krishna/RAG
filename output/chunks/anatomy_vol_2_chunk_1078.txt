The QT interval represents the time from the start of depolarization to repolarization of the ventricles,
and includes the period of ventricular systole. Extremely high levels of calcium may induce cardiac arrest. Drugs known as
calcium channel blockers slow HR by binding to these channels and blocking or slowing the inward movement of calcium
ions.

 Caffeine and Nicotine

Caffeine and nicotine are not found naturally within the body. Both of these nonregulated drugs have an excitatory effect
on membranes of neurons in general and have a stimulatory effect on the cardiac centers specifically, causing an increase in
HR. Caffeine works by increasing the rates of depolarization at the SA node, whereas nicotine stimulates the activity of the
sympathetic neurons that deliver impulses to the heart.

Although it is the worldâ€™s most widely consumed psychoactive drug, caffeine is legal and not regulated.
