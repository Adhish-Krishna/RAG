The video summarizes the extent of the bodyâ€™s reactions
and describes several effects of the autonomic system in
response to fear. On the basis of what you have already
studied about autonomic function, which effect would you
expect to be associated with parasympathetic, rather than
sympathetic, activity?

6. Watch this video  (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/
3Dmovies) to learn about the side effects of 3-D movies. As
discussed in this video, movies that are shot in 3-D can cause
motion sickness, which elicits the autonomic symptoms of
nausea and sweating. The disconnection between the
perceived motion on the screen and the lack of any change
in equilibrium stimulates these symptoms. Why do you think
sitting close to the screen or right in the middle of the theater
makes motion sickness during a 3-D movie worse?
