The forearm flexors include the biceps brachii, brachialis, and brachioradialis. The extensors are the triceps brachii
and anconeus. The pronators are the pronator teres and the pronator quadratus. The supinator is the only one that turns the
orearm anteriorly.
 The extrinsic muscles of the hands originate along the forearm and insert into the hand in order to facilitate crude
movements of the wrists, hands, and fingers. The superficial anterior compartment of the forearm produces flexion. These
muscles are the flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor carpi ulnaris, and the flexor digitorum superficialis. The deep
anterior compartment produces flexion as well. These are the flexor pollicis longus and the flexor digitorum profundus.
 The rest of the compartments produce extension. The extensor carpi radialis longus, extensor carpi radialis brevis, extensor
digitorum, extensor digiti minimi, and extensor carpi ulnaris are the muscles found in the superficial posterior compartment.
