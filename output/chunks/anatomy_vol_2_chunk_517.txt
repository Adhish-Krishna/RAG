A related molecule, called pseudoephedrine, was much more commonly used in these applications than was
phenylephrine, until the molecule became useful in the illicit production of amphetamines. Phenylephrine is not as effective
as a drug because it can be partially broken down in the digestive tract before it is ever absorbed. Like the adrenergic agents,
phenylephrine is effective in dilating the pupil, known as mydriasis (Figure 15.14). Phenylephrine is used during an eye
exam in an ophthalmologist’s or optometrist’s office for this purpose. It can also be used to increase blood pressure in
situations in which cardiac function is compromised, such as under anesthesia or during septic shock.

 Figure 15.14 Mydriasis The sympathetic system causes pupillary dilation when norepinephrine binds to an
adrenergic receptor in the radial fibers of the iris smooth muscle. Phenylephrine mimics this action by binding to the
same receptor when drops are applied onto the surface of the eye in a doctor’s office.
