Moreover, the secretions of exocrine glands
are not hormones, but compounds that have an immediate physiologic function. For example, pancreatic juice contains enzymes
that help digest food. 40 True. Neurotransmitters can be classified as paracrines because, upon their release from a neuron’s
axon terminals, they travel across a microscopically small cleft to exert their effect on a nearby neuron or muscle cell. 41 In
both cAMP and IP3-calcium signaling, a hormone binds to a cell membrane hormone receptor that is coupled to a G protein.
 The G protein becomes activated when the hormone binds. In the case of cAMP signaling, the activated G protein activates
adenylyl cyclase, which causes ATP to be converted to cAMP. This second messenger can then initiate other signaling events,
such as a phosphorylation cascade. In the case of IP3—calcium signaling, the activated G protein activates phospholipase C, which
cleaves a membrane phospholipid compound into DAG and IP3.
