An inability to control bleeding, infection, and pain made surgeries infrequent, and
those that were performed—such as wound suturing, amputations, tooth and tumor removals, skull drilling, and cesarean
births—did not greatly advance knowledge about internal anatomy. Theories about the function of the body and about
disease were therefore largely based on external observations and imagination. During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries,
however, the detailed anatomical drawings of Italian artist and anatomist Leonardo da Vinci and Flemish anatomist Andreas
Vesalius were published, and interest in human anatomy began to increase. Medical schools began to teach anatomy using
human dissection; although some resorted to grave robbing to obtain corpses. Laws were eventually passed that enabled
students to dissect the corpses of criminals and those who donated their bodies for research. Still, it was not until the late
nineteenth century that medical researchers discovered non-surgical methods to look inside the living body.

X-Rays

German physicist Wilhelm Réntgen (1845-1923) was experimenting with electrical current when he discovered that a
mysterious and invisible “ray” would pass through his flesh but leave an outline of his bones on a screen coated with a metal
compound.
