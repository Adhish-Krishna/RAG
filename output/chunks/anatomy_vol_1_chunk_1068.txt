Using these criteria, there are three main types of skeletal muscle fibers. Slow oxidative (SO)
fibers contract relatively slowly and use aerobic respiration (oxygen and glucose) to produce ATP. Fast oxidative (FO)
fibers have fast contractions and primarily use aerobic respiration, but because they may switch to anaerobic respiration
(glycolysis), can fatigue more quickly than SO fibers. Lastly, fast glycolytic (FG) fibers have fast contractions and
primarily use anaerobic glycolysis. The FG fibers fatigue more quickly than the others. Most skeletal muscles in a human
contain(s) all three types, although in varying proportions.

 The speed of contraction is dependent on how quickly myosinâ€™s ATPase hydrolyzes ATP to produce cross-bridge
action. Fast fibers hydrolyze ATP approximately twice as quickly as slow fibers, resulting in much quicker cross-bridge
cycling (which pulls the thin filaments toward the center of the sarcomeres at a faster rate).
