Skin that
has four layers of cells is referred to as “thin skin.” From deep to superficial, these layers are the stratum basale, stratum
spinosum, stratum granulosum, and stratum corneum. Most of the skin can be classified as thin skin. “Thick skin” is found
only on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. It has a fifth layer, called the stratum lucidum, located between the
stratum corneum and the stratum granulosum (Figure 5.3).

Figure 5.3 Thin Skin versus Thick Skin These slides show cross-sections of the epidermis and dermis of (a) thin
and (b) thick skin. Note the significant difference in the thickness of the epithelial layer of the thick skin. From top, LM

The cells in all of the layers except the stratum basale are called keratinocytes.
