These include naming the muscle after its shape, its size compared to other muscles in the area, its location in the body
or the location of its attachments to the skeleton, how many origins it has, or its action.

 The skeletal muscle’s anatomical location or its relationship to a particular bone often determines its name. For
example, the frontalis muscle is located on top of the frontal bone of the skull. Similarly, the shapes of some muscles are
very distinctive and the names, such as orbicularis, reflect the shape. For the buttocks, the size of the muscles influences
the names: gluteus maximus (largest), gluteus medius (medium), and the gluteus minimus (smallest). Names were given
to indicate length— brevis (short), longus (long)—and to identify position relative to the midline: lateralis (to the outside
away from the midline), and medialis (toward the midline).
