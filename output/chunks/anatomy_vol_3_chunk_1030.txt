Generally, a pulse pressure should be at least 25 percent of the systolic pressure, but not more than 100 mm Hg. Since 25
percent of 130 = 32.5, the patient’s pulse pressure of 45 is normal. The patient’s mean arterial pressure is 85 + 1/3 (45) = 85 + 15=
100. Normally, the mean arterial blood pressure falls within the range of 70 — 110 mmHg, so 100 is normal. 32 People who stand
upright all day and are inactive overall have very little skeletal muscle activity in the legs. Pooling of blood in the legs and feet is
common. Venous return to the heart is reduced, a condition that in turn reduces cardiac output and therefore oxygenation of tissues
throughout the body. This could at least partially account for the patient’s fatigue and shortness of breath, as well as her “spaced
out” feeling, which commonly reflects reduced oxygen to the brain.
