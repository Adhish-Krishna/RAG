At the Gj checkpoint, the cell must be ready for
DNA synthesis to occur. At the G2 checkpoint the cell must be fully prepared for mitosis. Even during mitosis, a crucial stop
and go checkpoint in metaphase ensures that the cell is fully prepared to complete cell division. The metaphase checkpoint
ensures that all sister chromatids are properly attached to their respective microtubules and lined up at the metaphase plate
before the signal is given to separate them during anaphase.

 Figure 3.33 Control of the Cell Cycle Cells proceed through the cell cycle under the control of a variety of molecules,
such as cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases. These control molecules determine whether or not the cell is prepared
to move into the following stage.
