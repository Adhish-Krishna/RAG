The five major peritoneal folds are described in Table 23.2.
 Note that during fetal development, certain digestive structures, including the first portion of the small intestine (called the
duodenum), the pancreas, and portions of the large intestine (the ascending and descending colon, and the rectum) remain
completely or partially posterior to the peritoneum. Thus, the location of these organs is described as retroperitoneal.
