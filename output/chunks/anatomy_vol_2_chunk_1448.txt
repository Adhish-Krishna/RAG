Immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine A have made transplants more successful, but matching the MHC
molecules is still key. In humans, there are six MHC molecules that show the most polymorphisms, three class I molecules
(A, B, and C) and three class II molecules called DP, DQ, and DR. A successful transplant usually requires a match between
at least 3-4 of these molecules, with more matches associated with greater success. Family members, since they share a
similar genetic background, are much more likely to share MHC molecules than unrelated individuals do. In fact, due to
the extensive polymorphisms in these MHC molecules, unrelated donors are found only through a worldwide database. The
system is not foolproof however, as there are not enough individuals in the system to provide the organs necessary to treat
all patients needing them.
