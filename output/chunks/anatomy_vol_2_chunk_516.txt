These drugs either bind to particular
adrenergic receptors and mimic norepinephrine at the synapses between sympathetic postganglionic fibers and their
targets, or they increase the production and release of norepinephrine from postganglionic fibers. Also, to increase the
effectiveness of adrenergic chemicals released from the fibers, some of these drugs may block the removal or reuptake of
the neurotransmitter from the synapse.

 A common sympathomimetic drug is phenylephrine, which is a common component of decongestants. It can also be
used to dilate the pupil and to raise blood pressure. Phenylephrine is known as an a-adrenergic agonist, meaning that
it binds to a specific adrenergic receptor, stimulating a response. In this role, phenylephrine will bind to the adrenergic
receptors in bronchioles of the lungs and cause them to dilate. By opening these structures, accumulated mucus can be
cleared out of the lower respiratory tract. Phenylephrine is often paired with other pharmaceuticals, such as analgesics, as

in the “sinus” version of many over-the-counter drugs, such as Tylenol Sinus” or Excedrin Sinus®, or in expectorants for

chest congestion such as in Robitussin CF®.
