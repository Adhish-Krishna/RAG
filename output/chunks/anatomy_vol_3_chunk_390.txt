The Absorptive State

The absorptive state, or the fed state, occurs after a meal when your body is digesting the food and absorbing the nutrients
(catabolism exceeds anabolism). Digestion begins the moment you put food into your mouth, as the food is broken down
into its constituent parts to be absorbed through the intestine. The digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth, whereas
the digestion of proteins and fats begins in the stomach and small intestine. The constituent parts of these carbohydrates,
fats, and proteins are transported across the intestinal wall and enter the bloodstream (sugars and amino acids) or the
lymphatic system (fats). From the intestines, these systems transport them to the liver, adipose tissue, or muscle cells that
will process and use, or store, the energy.

 Depending on the amounts and types of nutrients ingested, the absorptive state can linger for up to 4 hours. The
ingestion of food and the rise of glucose concentrations in the bloodstream stimulate pancreatic beta cells to release insulin
into the bloodstream, where it initiates the absorption of blood glucose by liver hepatocytes, and by adipose and muscle
cells.
