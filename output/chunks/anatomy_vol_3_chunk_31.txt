Continuous with the laryngopharynx, the superior portion of the larynx is lined with stratified squamous epithelium,
transitioning into pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium that contains goblet cells. Similar to the nasal cavity and
nasopharynx, this specialized epithelium produces mucus to trap debris and pathogens as they enter the trachea. The cilia
beat the mucus upward towards the laryngopharynx, where it can be swallowed down the esophagus.

 Trachea

The trachea (windpipe) extends from the larynx toward the lungs (Figure 22.9a). The trachea is formed by 16 to 20
stacked, C-shaped pieces of hyaline cartilage that are connected by dense connective tissue. The trachealis muscle and
elastic connective tissue together form the fibroelastic membrane, a flexible membrane that closes the posterior surface
of the trachea, connecting the C-shaped cartilages. The fibroelastic membrane allows the trachea to stretch and expand
slightly during inhalation and exhalation, whereas the rings of cartilage provide structural support and prevent the trachea
from collapsing.
