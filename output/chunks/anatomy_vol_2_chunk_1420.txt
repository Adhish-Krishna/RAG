Immune responses in some mucosal tissues such as the Peyer’s patches (see Figure 21.11) in the small intestine take
up particulate antigens by specialized cells known as microfold or M cells (Figure 21.27). These cells allow the body to
sample potential pathogens from the intestinal lumen. Dendritic cells then take the antigen to the regional lymph nodes,
where an immune response is mounted.

Figure 21.27 IgA Immunity The nasal-associated lymphoid tissue and Peyer’s patches of the small intestine
generate IgA immunity. Both use M cells to transport antigen inside the body so that immune responses can be
mounted.

Defenses against Bacteria and Fungi

The body fights bacterial pathogens with a wide variety of immunological mechanisms, essentially trying to find one that is
effective.
