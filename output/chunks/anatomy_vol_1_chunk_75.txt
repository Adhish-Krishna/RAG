Which organ has primary control over the amount of water in the body?

Positive Feedback

Positive feedback intensifies a change in the body’s physiological condition rather than reversing it. A deviation from the
normal range results in more change, and the system moves farther away from the normal range. Positive feedback in the
body is normal only when there is a definite end point. Childbirth and the body’s response to blood loss are two examples
of positive feedback loops that are normal but are activated only when needed.

 Childbirth at full term is an example of a situation in which the maintenance of the existing body state is not desired.
 Enormous changes in the mother’s body are required to expel the baby at the end of pregnancy. And the events of childbirth,
once begun, must progress rapidly to a conclusion or the life of the mother and the baby are at risk.
