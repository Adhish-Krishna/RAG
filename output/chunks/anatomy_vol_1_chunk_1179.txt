Intercostal Muscles The external intercostals are located laterally on the sides of the body. The internal
intercostals are located medially near the sternum. The innermost intercostals are located deep to both the internal
and external intercostals.

 The 11 pairs of superficial external intercostal muscles aid in inspiration of air during breathing because when they
contract, they raise the rib cage, which expands it. The 11 pairs of internal intercostal muscles, just under the externals,
are used for expiration because they draw the ribs together to constrict the rib cage. The innermost intercostal muscles are
the deepest, and they act as synergists for the action of the internal intercostals.

 Muscles of the Pelvic Floor and Perineum

The pelvic floor is a muscular sheet that defines the inferior portion of the pelvic cavity. The pelvic diaphragm, spanning
anteriorly to posteriorly from the pubis to the coccyx, comprises the levator ani and the ischiococcygeus. Its openings
include the anal canal and urethra, and the vagina in women.
