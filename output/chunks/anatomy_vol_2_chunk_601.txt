For example, the
line that represents 20/200 vision would have larger letters so that they are legible to the person with normal acuity at
200 feet.

 The optic nerves from both sides enter the cranium through the respective optic canals and meet at the optic chiasm
at which fibers sort such that the two halves of the visual field are processed by the opposite sides of the brain. Deficits in
visual field perception often suggest damage along the length of the optic pathway between the orbit and the diencephalon.
 For example, loss of peripheral vision may be the result of a pituitary tumor pressing on the optic chiasm (Figure 16.8). The
pituitary, seated in the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone, is directly inferior to the optic chiasm. The axons that decussate
in the chiasm are from the medial retinae of either eye, and therefore carry information from the peripheral visual field.
