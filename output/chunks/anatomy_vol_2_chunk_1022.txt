This passage takes approximately 25 ms.

The Purkinje fibers are additional myocardial conductive fibers that spread the impulse to the myocardial contractile
cells in the ventricles. They extend throughout the myocardium from the apex of the heart toward the atrioventricular septum
and the base of the heart. The Purkinje fibers have a fast inherent conduction rate, and the electrical impulse reaches all of
the ventricular muscle cells in about 75 ms (see Figure 19.19, step 5). Since the electrical stimulus begins at the apex, the
contraction also begins at the apex and travels toward the base of the heart, similar to squeezing a tube of toothpaste from
the bottom. This allows the blood to be pumped out of the ventricles and into the aorta and pulmonary trunk. The total time
elapsed from the initiation of the impulse in the SA node until depolarization of the ventricles is approximately 225 ms.

Membrane Potentials and lon Movement in Cardiac Conductive Cells

Action potentials are considerably different between cardiac conductive cells and cardiac contractive cells.
