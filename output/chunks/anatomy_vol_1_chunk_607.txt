The small intestine is also affected by PTH, albeit indirectly. Because another function of PTH is to stimulate the
synthesis of vitamin D, and because vitamin D promotes intestinal absorption of calcium, PTH indirectly increases calcium
uptake by the small intestine. Calcitonin, a hormone secreted by the thyroid gland, has some effects that counteract those
of PTH. Calcitonin inhibits osteoclast activity and stimulates calcium uptake by the bones, thus reducing the concentration
of calcium ions in the blood. As evidenced by their opposing functions in maintaining calcium homeostasis, PTH and
calcitonin are generally not secreted at the same time. Table 6.6 summarizes the hormones that influence the skeletal
system.

 Hormones That Affect the Skeletal System

Hormone Role
Growth . oo. - .
hormone Increases length of long bones, enhances mineralization, and improves bone density
Thyroxine Stimulates bone growth and promotes synthesis of bone matrix
Sex Promote osteoblastic activity and production of bone matrix; responsible for adolescent growth
hormones spurt; promote conversion of epiphyseal plate to epiphyseal line
Calcitriol Stimulates absorption of calcium and phosphate from digestive tract
