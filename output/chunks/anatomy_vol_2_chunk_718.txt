This complex
secretes several hormones that directly produce responses in target tissues, as well as hormones that regulate the synthesis
and secretion of hormones of other glands. In addition, the hypothalamus-pituitary complex coordinates the messages
of the endocrine and nervous systems. In many cases, a stimulus received by the nervous system must pass through the
hypothalamus-pituitary complex to be translated into hormones that can initiate a response.

 The hypothalamus is a structure of the diencephalon of the brain located anterior and inferior to the thalamus (Figure
17.7). It has both neural and endocrine functions, producing and secreting many hormones. In addition, the hypothalamus
is anatomically and functionally related to the pituitary gland (or hypophysis), a bean-sized organ suspended from it
by a stem called the infundibulum (or pituitary stalk).
