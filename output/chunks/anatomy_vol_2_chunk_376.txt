During head movement,
the eye muscles move the eyes in the opposite direction as the head movement, keeping the visual stimulus centered
in the field of view.

 The connections of the optic nerve are more complicated than those of other cranial nerves. Instead of the connections
being between each eye and the brain, visual information is segregated between the left and right sides of the visual field.
 In addition, some of the information from one side of the visual field projects to the opposite side of the brain. Within each
eye, the axons projecting from the medial side of the retina decussate at the optic chiasm. For example, the axons from the
medial retina of the left eye cross over to the right side of the brain at the optic chiasm. However, within each eye, the axons
projecting from the lateral side of the retina do not decussate. For example, the axons from the lateral retina of the right eye
project back to the right side of the brain.
