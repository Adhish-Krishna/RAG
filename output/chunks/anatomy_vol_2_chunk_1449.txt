One disease of transplantation occurs with bone marrow transplants, which are used to treat various diseases, including
SCID and leukemia. Because the bone marrow cells being transplanted contain lymphocytes capable of mounting an
immune response, and because the recipient’s immune response has been destroyed before receiving the transplant, the
donor cells may attack the recipient tissues, causing graft-versus-host disease. Symptoms of this disease, which usually
include a rash and damage to the liver and mucosa, are variable, and attempts have been made to moderate the disease by
first removing mature T cells from the donor bone marrow before transplanting it.

 Immune Responses Against Cancer

It is clear that with some cancers, for example Kaposi’s sarcoma, a healthy immune system does a good job at controlling
them (Figure 21.31). This disease, which is caused by the human herpesvirus, is almost never observed in individuals with
strong immune systems, such as the young and immunocompetent.
