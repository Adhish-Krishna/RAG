It prompts the production of erythrocytes. Some athletes use synthetic EPO as a performance-
enhancing drug (called blood doping) to increase RBC counts and subsequently increase oxygen delivery to tissues
throughout the body. EPO is a banned substance in most organized sports, but it is also used medically in the treatment
of certain anemia, specifically those triggered by certain types of cancer, and other disorders in which increased
erythrocyte counts and oxygen levels are desirable.

megakaryocytes into platelets.

 * Cytokines are glycoproteins secreted by a wide variety of cells, including red bone marrow, leukocytes, macrophages,
fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. They act locally as autocrine or paracrine factors, stimulating the proliferation o
progenitor cells and helping to stimulate both nonspecific and specific resistance to disease.
