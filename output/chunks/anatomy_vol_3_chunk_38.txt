In addition, asthma is the
most frequent cause of hospitalization in children.

 Asthma is a chronic disease characterized by inflammation and edema of the airway, and bronchospasms (that
is, constriction of the bronchioles), which can inhibit air from entering the lungs. In addition, excessive mucus
secretion can occur, which further contributes to airway occlusion (Figure 22.12). Cells of the immune system, such
as eosinophils and mononuclear cells, may also be involved in infiltrating the walls of the bronchi and bronchioles.

 Bronchospasms occur periodically and lead to an “asthma attack.” An attack may be triggered by environmental
factors such as dust, pollen, pet hair, or dander, changes in the weather, mold, tobacco smoke, and respiratory
infections, or by exercise and stress.
