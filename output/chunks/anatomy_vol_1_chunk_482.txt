Figure 5.7 Layers of the Dermis_ This stained slide shows the two components of the dermis—the papillary layer
and the reticular layer. Both are made of connective tissue with fibers of collagen extending from one to the other,
making the border between the two somewhat indistinct. The dermal papillae extending into the epidermis belong to
the papillary layer, whereas the dense collagen fiber bundles below belong to the reticular layer. LM x 10. (credit:

Papillary Layer

The papillary layer is made of loose, areolar connective tissue, which means the collagen and elastin fibers of this layer
form a loose mesh. This superficial layer of the dermis projects into the stratum basale of the epidermis to form finger-like
dermal papillae (see Figure 5.7). Within the papillary layer are fibroblasts, a small number of fat cells (adipocytes), and
an abundance of small blood vessels.
