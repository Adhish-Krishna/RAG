into the hyperosmotic cytoplasm, causing the
pathogen to lyse.

 Figure 21.13 Complement Cascade and Function The classical pathway, used during adaptive immune responses,
occurs when C1 reacts with antibodies that have bound an antigen.

 The splitting of the C3 protein is the common step to both pathways. In the alternate pathway, C3 is activated
spontaneously and, after reacting with the molecules factor P, factor B, and factor D, splits apart. The larger fragment, C3b,
binds to the surface of the pathogen and C3a, the smaller fragment, diffuses outward from the site of activation and attracts
phagocytes to the site of infection. Surface-bound C3b then activates the rest of the cascade, with the last five proteins,
C5-C9, forming the membrane-attack complex (MAC). The MAC can kill certain pathogens by disrupting their osmotic
balance. The MAC is especially effective against a broad range of bacteria. The classical pathway is similar, except the
early stages of activation require the presence of antibody bound to antigen, and thus is dependent on the adaptive immune
response.
