For example, the tongue and throat muscles of some individuals with obstructive
sleep apnea may relax excessively, causing the muscles to push into the airway. Another example is obesity, which is
a known risk factor for sleep apnea, as excess adipose tissue in the neck region can push the soft tissues towards the
lumen of the airway, causing the trachea to narrow.

 In central sleep apnea, the respiratory centers of the brain do not respond properly to rising carbon dioxide
levels and therefore do not stimulate the contraction of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles regularly. As a result,
inspiration does not occur and breathing stops for a short period. In some cases, the cause of central sleep apnea
is unknown. However, some medical conditions, such as stroke and congestive heart failure, may cause damage to
the pons or medulla oblongata. In addition, some pharmacologic agents, such as morphine, can affect the respiratory
centers, causing a decrease in the respiratory rate.
