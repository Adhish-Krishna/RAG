A muscle may also stop contracting when it runs out of ATP and
becomes fatigued.

 The release of calcium ions initiates muscle contractions. Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/calciumrole)
to learn more about the role of calcium. (a) What are “T-tubules” and what is their role? (b) Please describe how actin-
binding sites are made available for cross-bridging with myosin heads during contraction.

 The molecular events of muscle fiber shortening occur within the fiber’s sarcomeres (see Figure 10.10). The
contraction of a striated muscle fiber occurs as the sarcomeres, linearly arranged within myofibrils, shorten as myosin heads
pull on the actin filaments.

 The region where thick and thin filaments overlap has a dense appearance, as there is little space between the filaments.
 This zone where thin and thick filaments overlap is very important to muscle contraction, as it is the site where filament
movement starts.
