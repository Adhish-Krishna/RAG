Along with constricting the pupil through the
smooth muscle of the iris, pilocarpine will also cause the ciliary muscle to contract. This will open perforations at the base
of the cornea, allowing for the drainage of aqueous humor from the anterior compartment of the eye and, therefore, reducing
intraocular pressure related to glaucoma.

 Atropine and scopolamine are part of a class of muscarinic antagonists that come from the Atropa genus of plants that
include belladonna or deadly nightshade (Figure 15.15). The name of one of these plants, belladonna, refers to the fact
that extracts from this plant were used cosmetically for dilating the pupil. The active chemicals from this plant block the
muscarinic receptors in the iris and allow the pupil to dilate, which is considered attractive because it makes the eyes appear
larger. Humans are instinctively attracted to anything with larger eyes, which comes from the fact that the ratio of eye-to-
head size is different in infants (or baby animals) and can elicit an emotional response.
