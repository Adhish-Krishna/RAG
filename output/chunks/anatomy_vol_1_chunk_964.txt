Small surgical instruments are also inserted via
additional incisions. These tools allow a surgeon to remove or repair a torn meniscus or to reconstruct a ruptured
cruciate ligament. The current method for anterior cruciate ligament replacement involves using a portion of the
patellar ligament. Holes are drilled into the cruciate ligament attachment points on the tibia and femur, and the patellar
ligament graft, with small areas of attached bone still intact at each end, is inserted into these holes. The bone-to-bone
sites at each end of the graft heal rapidly and strongly, thus enabling a rapid recovery.

Figure 9.20 Knee Injury A strong blow to the lateral side of the extended knee will cause three injuries, in
sequence: tearing of the tibial collateral ligament, damage to the medial meniscus, and rupture of the anterior
cruciate ligament.
