The recommendation for daily
intake/consumption of potassium is 4700 mg. Potassium is excreted, both actively and passively, through the renal tubules,
especially the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts. Potassium participates in the exchange with sodium in the renal
tubules under the influence of aldosterone, which also relies on basolateral sodium-potassium pumps.

 Hypokalemia is an abnormally low potassium blood level. Similar to the situation with hyponatremia, hypokalemia
can occur because of either an absolute reduction of potassium in the body or a relative reduction of potassium in the blood
due to the redistribution of potassium. An absolute loss of potassium can arise from decreased intake, frequently related to
starvation. It can also come about from vomiting, diarrhea, or alkalosis.

 Some insulin-dependent diabetic patients experience a relative reduction of potassium in the blood from the
redistribution of potassium. When insulin is administered and glucose is taken up by cells, potassium passes through the cell

membrane along with glucose, decreasing the amount of potassium in the blood and IF, which can cause hyperpolarization
of the cell membranes of neurons, reducing their responses to stimuli.
