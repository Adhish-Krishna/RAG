Figure 7.23 Parts of a Typical Vertebra A typical vertebra consists of a body and a vertebral arch. The arch is
formed by the paired pedicles and paired laminae. Arising from the vertebral arch are the transverse, spinous, superior
articular, and inferior articular processes. The vertebral foramen provides for passage of the spinal cord. Each spinal
nerve exits through an intervertebral foramen, located between adjacent vertebrae. Intervertebral discs unite the
bodies of adjacent vertebrae.

Figure 7.24 Intervertebral Disc The bodies of adjacent vertebrae are separated and united by an intervertebral disc,
which provides padding and allows for movements between adjacent vertebrae. The disc consists of a fibrous outer
layer called the anulus fibrosus and a gel-like center called the nucleus pulposus.
