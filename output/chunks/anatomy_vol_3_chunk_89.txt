This
large difference in partial pressure creates a very strong pressure gradient that causes oxygen to rapidly cross the respiratory
membrane from the alveoli into the blood.

 The partial pressure of carbon dioxide is also different between the alveolar air and the blood of the capillary. However,
the partial pressure difference is less than that of oxygen, about 5 mm Hg. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood
of the capillary is about 45 mm Hg, whereas its partial pressure in the alveoli is about 40 mm Hg. However, the solubility of
carbon dioxide is much greater than that of oxygen—by a factor of about 20—in both blood and alveolar fluids. As a result,
the relative concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide that diffuse across the respiratory membrane are similar.

 Internal Respiration

Internal respiration is gas exchange that occurs at the level of body tissues (Figure 22.23). Similar to external respiration,
internal respiration also occurs as simple diffusion due to a partial pressure gradient.
