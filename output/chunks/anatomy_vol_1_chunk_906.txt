Another example is the radiocarpal joint of the
wrist, between the shallow depression at the distal end of the radius bone and the rounded scaphoid, lunate, and triquetrum
carpal bones. In this case, the articulation area has a more oval (elliptical) shape. Functionally, condyloid joints are biaxial
joints that allow for two planes of movement. One movement involves the bending and straightening of the fingers or the
anterior-posterior movements of the hand. The second movement is a side-to-side movement, which allows you to spread
your fingers apart and bring them together, or to move your hand in a medial-going or lateral-going direction.

 Saddle Joint

At a saddle joint, both of the articulating surfaces for the bones have a saddle shape, which is concave in one direction and
convex in the other (see Figure 9.10c).
