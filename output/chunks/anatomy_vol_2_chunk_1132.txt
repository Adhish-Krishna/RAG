Substances that can pass between cells include metabolic products, such as glucose, water, and small
hydrophobic molecules like gases and hormones, as well as various leukocytes. Continuous capillaries not associated with
the brain are rich in transport vesicles, contributing to either endocytosis or exocytosis. Those in the brain are part of the
blood-brain barrier. Here, there are tight junctions and no intercellular clefts, plus a thick basement membrane and astrocyte
extensions called end feet; these structures combine to prevent the movement of nearly all substances.

Figure 20.5 Types of Capillaries The three major types of capillaries: continuous, fenestrated, and sinusoid.

Fenestrated Capillaries

A fenestrated capillary is one that has pores (or fenestrations) in addition to tight junctions in the endothelial lining.
