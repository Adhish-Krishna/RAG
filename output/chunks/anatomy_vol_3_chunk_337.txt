CHAPTER 24 | METABOLISM AND NUTRITION 1085

Carbohydrates are organic molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. The family of carbohydrates
includes both simple and complex sugars. Glucose and fructose are examples of simple sugars, and starch, glycogen,
and cellulose are all examples of complex sugars. The complex sugars are also called polysaccharides and are made of
multiple monosaccharide molecules.
