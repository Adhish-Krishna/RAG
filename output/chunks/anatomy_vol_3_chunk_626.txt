The bicarbonate is regulated in the
blood by sodium, as are the phosphate ions. When sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), comes into contact with a strong acid,
such as HCl, carbonic acid (H2COs3), which is a weak acid, and NaCl are formed. When carbonic acid comes into contact
with a strong base, such as NaOH, bicarbonate and water are formed.

NaHCO; + HCl > H,CO3+NaCl

(sodium bicarbonate) + (strong acid) â€” (weak acid) + (salt)
H,CO;3 + NaOH > HCO3. + H,O
(weak acid) + (strong base) > (bicarbonate) + (water)

As with the phosphate buffer, a weak acid or weak base captures the free ions, and a significant change in pH is
prevented. Bicarbonate ions and carbonic acid are present in the blood in a 20:1 ratio if the blood pH is within the normal
range.
