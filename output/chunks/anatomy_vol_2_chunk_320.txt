Olfactory System: Anosmia

Blunt force trauma to the face, such as that common in many car accidents, can lead to the loss of the olfactory
nerve, and subsequently, loss of the sense of smell. This condition is known as anosmia. When the frontal lobe of
the brain moves relative to the ethmoid bone, the olfactory tract axons may be sheared apart. Professional fighters
often experience anosmia because of repeated trauma to face and head. In addition, certain pharmaceuticals, such as
antibiotics, can cause anosmia by killing all the olfactory neurons at once.
