calcium drop, parathyroid hormone (PTH) secreted by the parathyroid glands stimulates the release of calcium ions from
bone matrices and increases the reabsorption of calcium by the kidneys. PTH also upregulates the activation of vitamin D
in the kidney, which then facilitates intestinal calcium ion absorption.
