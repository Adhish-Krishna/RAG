Neurotransmitters act locally and rapidly. When an electrical signal in the form of an action potential arrives
at the synaptic terminal, they diffuse across the synaptic cleft (the gap between a sending neuron and a receiving neuron
or muscle cell). Once the neurotransmitters interact (bind) with receptors on the receiving (post-synaptic) cell, the receptor
stimulation is transduced into a response such as continued electrical signaling or modification of cellular response. The
target cell responds within milliseconds of receiving the chemical “message”; this response then ceases very quickly once
the neural signaling ends. In this way, neural communication enables body functions that involve quick, brief actions, such
as movement, sensation, and cognition. In contrast, the endocrine system uses just one method of communication: chemical
signaling. These signals are sent by the endocrine organs, which secrete chemicals—the hormone—into the extracellular
fluid.
