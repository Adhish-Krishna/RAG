After entering the circulation, approximately one-third migrate to the spleen for storage for later release in response to
any rupture in a blood vessel. They then become activated to perform their primary function, which is to limit blood loss.

 Platelets remain only about 10 days, then are phagocytized by macrophages.

 Platelets are critical to hemostasis, the stoppage of blood flow following damage to a vessel. They also secrete a variety
of growth factors essential for growth and repair of tissue, particularly connective tissue. Infusions of concentrated platelets

are now being used in some therapies to stimulate healing.
