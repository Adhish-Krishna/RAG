On the inferior aspect of the skull, each half of the sphenoid bone forms two thin, vertically oriented bony plates.
 These are the medial pterygoid plate and lateral pterygoid plate (pterygoid = “wing-shaped”). The right and left medial
pterygoid plates form the posterior, lateral walls of the nasal cavity. The somewhat larger lateral pterygoid plates serve as
attachment sites for chewing muscles that fill the infratemporal space and act on the mandible.
