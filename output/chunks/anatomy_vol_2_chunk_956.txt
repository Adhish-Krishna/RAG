Figure 19.4 Dual System of the Human Blood Circulation Blood flows from the right atrium to the right ventricle,
where it is pumped into the pulmonary circuit. The blood in the pulmonary artery branches is low in oxygen but relatively
high in carbon dioxide. Gas exchange occurs in the pulmonary capillaries (oxygen into the blood, carbon dioxide out),
and blood high in oxygen and low in carbon dioxide is returned to the left atrium. From here, blood enters the left
ventricle, which pumps it into the systemic circuit. Following exchange in the systemic capillaries (oxygen and nutrients
out of the capillaries and carbon dioxide and wastes in), blood returns to the right atrium and the cycle is repeated.

 Membranes, Surface Features, and Layers

Our exploration of more in-depth heart structures begins by examining the membrane that surrounds the heart, the
prominent surface features of the heart, and the layers that form the wall of the heart.
