The opposing signals to the heart would both
depolarize and hyperpolarize the heart cells that establish the rhythm of the heartbeat, likely causing arrhythmia. Only
the sympathetic system governs systemic blood pressure so nicotine would cause an increase.

CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 635

Sympathetic Effect

The neurochemistry of the sympathetic system is based on the adrenergic system. Norepinephrine and epinephrine influence
target effectors by binding to the a-adrenergic or B-adrenergic receptors. Drugs that affect the sympathetic system affect
these chemical systems. The drugs can be classified by whether they enhance the functions of the sympathetic system or
interrupt those functions. A drug that enhances adrenergic function is known as a sympathomimetic drug, whereas a drug
that interrupts adrenergic function is a sympatholytic drug.

 Sympathomimetic Drugs

When the sympathetic system is not functioning correctly or the body is in a state of homeostatic imbalance, these drugs
act at postganglionic terminals and synapses in the sympathetic efferent pathway.
