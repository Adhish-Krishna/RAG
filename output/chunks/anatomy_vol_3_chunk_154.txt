23.1 | Overview of the Digestive System

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Identify the organs of the alimentary canal from proximal to distal, and briefly state their function
* Identify the accessory digestive organs and briefly state their function
 ¢ Describe the four fundamental tissue layers of the alimentary canal

Contrast the contributions of the enteric and autonomic nervous systems to digestive system functioning
¢ Explain how the peritoneum anchors the digestive organs

The function of the digestive system is to break down the foods you eat, release their nutrients, and absorb those nutrients
into the body. Although the small intestine is the workhorse of the system, where the majority of digestion occurs, and

where most of the released nutrients are absorbed into the blood or lymph, each of the digestive system organs makes a vital
contribution to this process (Figure 23.2).
