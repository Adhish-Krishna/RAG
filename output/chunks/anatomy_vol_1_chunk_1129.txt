When you first get up and start moving, your joints feel stiff for a number of reasons. After proper stretching and
warm-up, the synovial fluid may become less viscous, allowing for better joint function.

 Patterns of Fascicle Organization

Skeletal muscle is enclosed in connective tissue scaffolding at three levels. Each muscle fiber (cell) is covered by
endomysium and the entire muscle is covered by epimysium. When a group of muscle fibers is “bundled” as a unit within
the whole muscle by an additional covering of a connective tissue called perimysium, that bundled group of muscle fibers
is called a fascicle. Fascicle arrangement by perimysia is correlated to the force generated by a muscle; it also affects the
range of motion of the muscle. Based on the patterns of fascicle arrangement, skeletal muscles can be classified in several

ways. What follows are the most common fascicle arrangements.

 Parallel muscles have fascicles that are arranged in the same direction as the long axis of the muscle (Figure 11.3).
