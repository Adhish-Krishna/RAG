The tegmentum of the midbrain and pons continues into the medulla because this gray matter is

the reticular formation, is related to sleep and wakefulness, such as general brain activity and attention.

 The Cerebellum

The cerebellum, as the name suggests, is the “little brain.” It is covered in gyri and sulci like the cerebrum, and looks like a
