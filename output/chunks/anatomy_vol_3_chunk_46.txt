Pleura of the Lungs

Each lung is enclosed within a cavity that is surrounded by the pleura. The pleura (plural = pleurae) is a serous membrane
that surrounds the lung. The right and left pleurae, which enclose the right and left lungs, respectively, are separated by the
mediastinum. The pleurae consist of two layers. The visceral pleura is the layer that is superficial to the lungs, and extends

into and lines the lung fissures (Figure 22.14). In contrast, the parietal pleura is the outer layer that connects to the thoracic
wall, the mediastinum, and the diaphragm. The visceral and parietal pleurae connect to each other at the hilum. The pleural
cavity is the space between the visceral and parietal layers.

The pleurae perform two major functions: They produce pleural fluid and create cavities that separate the major organs.
