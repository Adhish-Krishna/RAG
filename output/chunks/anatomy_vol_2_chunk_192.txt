The
pattern of these folds of tissue indicates specific regions of the cerebral cortex.

 The head is limited by the size of the birth canal, and the brain must fit inside the cranial cavity of the skull. Extensive
folding in the cerebral cortex enables more gray matter to fit into this limited space. If the gray matter of the cortex were
peeled off of the cerebrum and laid out flat, its surface area would be roughly equal to one square meter.

 The folding of the cortex maximizes the amount of gray matter in the cranial cavity. During embryonic development,
as the telencephalon expands within the skull, the brain goes through a regular course of growth that results in everyoneâ€™s
brain having a similar pattern of folds. The surface of the brain can be mapped on the basis of the locations of large gyri and
sulci. Using these landmarks, the cortex can be separated into four major regions, or lobes (Figure 13.7).
