The adjoining regions are each referred to
as association areas. Primary areas are where sensory information is initially received from the thalamus for conscious
perception, or—in the case of the primary motor cortex—where descending commands are sent down to the brain stem or
spinal cord to execute movements (Figure 16.5).

Figure 16.5 Types of Cortical Areas The cerebral cortex can be described as containing three types of processing
regions: primary, association, and integration areas.
