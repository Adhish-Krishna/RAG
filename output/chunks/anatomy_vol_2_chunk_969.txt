Since these openings and valves structurally weaken the atrioventricular septum, the remaining tissue is
heavily reinforced with dense connective tissue called the cardiac skeleton, or skeleton of the heart. It includes four rings
that surround the openings between the atria and ventricles, and the openings to the pulmonary trunk and aorta, and serve as
the point of attachment for the heart valves. The cardiac skeleton also provides an important boundary in the heart electrical
conduction system.
