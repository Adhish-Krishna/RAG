Proteins are not stored for later use, so excess proteins must be converted into glucose or
triglycerides, and used to supply energy or build energy reserves. Although the body can synthesize proteins from amino
acids, food is an important source of those amino acids, especially because humans cannot synthesize all of the 20 amino
acids used to build proteins.


 1104 CHAPTER 24 | METABOLISM AND NUTRITION

 The digestion of proteins begins in the stomach. When protein-rich foods enter the stomach, they are greeted by a
mixture of the enzyme pepsin and hydrochloric acid (HCI; 0.5 percent). The latter produces an environmental pH of 1.5-3.5
that denatures proteins within food. Pepsin cuts proteins into smaller polypeptides and their constituent amino acids. When
the food-gastric juice mixture (chyme) enters the small intestine, the pancreas releases sodium bicarbonate to neutralize
the HCl. This helps to protect the lining of the intestine. The small intestine also releases digestive hormones, including
secretin and CCK, which stimulate digestive processes to break down the proteins further.
