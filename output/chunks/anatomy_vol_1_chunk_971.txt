The
embryonic tissue that gives rise to all bones, cartilages, and connective tissues of the body is called mesenchyme. In the
head, mesenchyme will accumulate at those areas that will become the bones that form the top and sides of the skull. The
mesenchyme in these areas will develop directly into bone through the process of intramembranous ossification, in which
mesenchymal cells differentiate into bone-producing cells that then generate bone tissue. The mesenchyme between the
areas of bone production will become the fibrous connective tissue that fills the spaces between the developing bones.
 Initially, the connective tissue-filled gaps between the bones are wide, and are called fontanelles. After birth, as the skull
bones grow and enlarge, the gaps between them decrease in width and the fontanelles are reduced to suture joints in which
the bones are united by a narrow layer of fibrous connective tissue.
