(The basal nuclei are also referred to as the basal ganglia,
although that is potentially confusing because the term ganglia is typically used for peripheral structures.)

 The major structures of the basal nuclei that control movement are the caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus, which
are located deep in the cerebrum. The caudate is a long nucleus that follows the basic C-shape of the cerebrum from the
frontal lobe, through the parietal and occipital lobes, into the temporal lobe. The putamen is mostly deep in the anterior
regions of the frontal and parietal lobes. Together, the caudate and putamen are called the striatum. The globus pallidus is
a layered nucleus that lies just medial to the putamen; they are called the lenticular nuclei because they look like curved
pieces fitting together like lenses. The globus pallidus has two subdivisions, the external and internal segments, which are
lateral and medial, respectively.
