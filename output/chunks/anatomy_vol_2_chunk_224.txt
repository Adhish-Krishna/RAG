Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/!/graymatter) to learn about the gray matter of the spinal cord that
receives input from fibers of the dorsal (posterior) root and sends information out through the fibers of the ventral
(anterior) root. As discussed in this video, these connections represent the interactions of the CNS with peripheral
structures for both sensory and motor functions. The cervical and lumbar spinal cords have enlargements as a result of
larger populations of neurons. What are these enlargements responsible for?

Basal Nuclei

Parkinson’s disease is a disorder of the basal nuclei, specifically of the substantia nigra, that demonstrates the effects
of the direct and indirect pathways. Parkinson’s disease is the result of neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta
dying. These neurons release dopamine into the striatum. Without that modulatory influence, the basal nuclei are stuck
in the indirect pathway, without the direct pathway being activated.
