This
interrelationship of cardiovascular and respiratory control cannot be overemphasized.

 Other neural mechanisms can also have a significant impact on cardiovascular function. These include the limbic
system that links physiological responses to psychological stimuli, as well as generalized sympathetic and parasympathetic
stimulation.

 Endocrine Regulation

Endocrine control over the cardiovascular system involves the catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, as well as
several hormones that interact with the kidneys in the regulation of blood volume.

Epinephrine and Norepinephrine

The catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine are released by the adrenal medulla, and enhance and extend the
body’s sympathetic or “fight-or-flight” response (see Figure 20.17). They increase heart rate and force of contraction, while
temporarily constricting blood vessels to organs not essential for flight-or-fight responses and redirecting blood flow to the
liver, muscles, and heart.
