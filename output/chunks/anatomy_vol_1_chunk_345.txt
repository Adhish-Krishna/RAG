The Cell Cycle Out of Control: Implications

Most people understand that cancer or tumors are caused by abnormal cells that multiply continuously. If the abnormal cells
continue to divide unstopped, they can damage the tissues around them, spread to other parts of the body, and eventually
result in death. In healthy cells, the tight regulation mechanisms of the cell cycle prevent this from happening, while failures
of cell cycle control can cause unwanted and excessive cell division. Failures of control may be caused by inherited genetic
abnormalities that compromise the function of certain “stop” and “go” signals. Environmental insult that damages DNA can
also cause dysfunction in those signals. Often, a combination of both genetic predisposition and environmental factors lead
to cancer.

 The process of a cell escaping its normal control system and becoming cancerous may actually happen throughout the
body quite frequently. Fortunately, certain cells of the immune system are capable of recognizing cells that have become
cancerous and destroying them.
