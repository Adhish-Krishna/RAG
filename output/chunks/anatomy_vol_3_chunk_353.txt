The enzyme
succinyl CoA dehydrogenase then converts succinyl CoA into succinate and forms the high-energy molecule GTP, which
transfers its energy to ADP to produce ATP. Succinate dehydrogenase then converts succinate into fumarate, forming a
molecule of FADH2. Fumarase then converts fumarate into malate, which malate dehydrogenase then converts back into

oxaloacetate while reducing NAD* to NADH. Oxaloacetate is then ready to combine with the next acetyl CoA to start the
Krebs cycle again (see Figure 24.7). For each turn of the cycle, three NADH, one ATP (through GTP), and one FADH2 are
created. Each carbon of pyruvate is converted into CO2, which is released as a byproduct of oxidative (aerobic) respiration.

 Oxidative Phosphorylation and the Electron Transport Chain

The electron transport chain (ETC) uses the NADH and FADH? produced by the Krebs cycle to generate ATP. Electrons
from NADH and FADH)2 are transferred through protein complexes embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane by
a series of enzymatic reactions.
