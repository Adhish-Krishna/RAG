Figure 7.25 Cervical Vertebrae A typical cervical vertebra has a small body, a bifid spinous process, transverse
processes that have a transverse foramen and are curved for spinal nerve passage. The atlas (C1 vertebra) does not
have a body or spinous process. It consists of an anterior and a posterior arch and elongated transverse processes.
 The axis (C2 vertebra) has the upward projecting dens, which articulates with the anterior arch of the atlas.

Thoracic Vertebrae

The bodies of the thoracic vertebrae are larger than those of cervical vertebrae (Figure 7.26). The characteristic feature
for a typical midthoracic vertebra is the spinous process, which is long and has a pronounced downward angle that causes
it to overlap the next inferior vertebra.
