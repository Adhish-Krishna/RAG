Many epithelial cells are capable of secretion and release mucous and specific chemical compounds onto their apical
surfaces. The epithelium of the small intestine releases digestive enzymes, for example. Cells lining the respiratory tract
secrete mucous that traps incoming microorganisms and particles. A glandular epithelium contains many secretory cells.

The Epithelial Cell

Epithelial cells are typically characterized by the polarized distribution of organelles and membrane-bound proteins between
their basal and apical surfaces. Particular structures found in some epithelial cells are an adaptation to specific functions.
 Certain organelles are segregated to the basal sides, whereas other organelles and extensions, such as cilia, when present,
are on the apical surface.

 Cilia are microscopic extensions of the apical cell membrane that are supported by microtubules. They beat in unison
and move fluids as well as trapped particles. Ciliated epithelium lines the ventricles of the brain where it helps circulate the
cerebrospinal fluid.
