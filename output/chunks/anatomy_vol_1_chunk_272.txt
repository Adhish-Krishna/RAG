Their diffusion is facilitated by membrane proteins that form sodium channels (or “pores”), so that Na*
ions can move down their concentration gradient from outside the cells to inside the cells. There are many other solutes that
must undergo facilitated diffusion to move into a cell, such as amino acids, or to move out of a cell, such as wastes. Because
facilitated diffusion is a passive process, it does not require energy expenditure by the cell.

 Water also can move freely across the cell membrane of all cells, either through protein channels or by slipping
between the lipid tails of the membrane itself. Osmosis is the diffusion of water through a semipermeable membrane
(Figure 3.7).

 Semipermeable membrane

Figure 3.7 Osmosis Osmosis is the diffusion of water through a semipermeable membrane down its concentration
gradient. If a membrane is permeable to water, though not to a solute, water will equalize its own concentration by
diffusing to the side of lower water concentration (and thus the side of higher solute concentration).
