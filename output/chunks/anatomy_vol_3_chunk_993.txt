41 Axons of pain sensing sensory neurons are thin and unmyelinated so that it takes longer for that sensation
to reach the brain than other sensations. 42 EPSP1 = +5 mV, EPSP2 = +7 mV, EPSP 3 = +10 mV, IPSP1 = -4 mV, IPSP2 =
-3mV.5+7+10-4-3=+15 mV. 43 Different neurotransmitters have different receptors. Thus, the type of receptor in the
postsynaptic cell is what determines which ion channels open. Acetylcholine binding to the nicotinic receptor causes cations to
cross the membrane. GABA binding to its receptor causes the anion chloride to cross the membrane.

1 The three regions (forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain) appear to be approximately equal in size when they are first established,
but the midbrain in the adult is much smaller than the othersâ€”suggesting that it does not increase in size nearly as much as the
forebrain or hindbrain.
