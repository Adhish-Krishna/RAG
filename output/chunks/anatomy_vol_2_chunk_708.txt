Upon binding calcium, calmodulin is able to modulate protein kinase within the cell. Examples of
hormones that use calcium ions as a second messenger system include angiotensin II, which helps regulate blood pressure
through vasoconstriction, and growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), which causes the pituitary gland to release
growth hormones.

 Factors Affecting Target Cell Response

You will recall that target cells must have receptors specific to a given hormone if that hormone is to trigger a response.
 But several other factors influence the target cell response. For example, the presence of a significant level of a hormone
circulating in the bloodstream can cause its target cells to decrease their number of receptors for that hormone. This
process is called downregulation, and it allows cells to become less reactive to the excessive hormone levels. When the
level of a hormone is chronically reduced, target cells engage in upregulation to increase their number of receptors.
