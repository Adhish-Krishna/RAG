As these mediators are released with mast cell
degranulation, type I hypersensitivity reactions are usually rapid and occur within just a few minutes, hence the term
immediate hypersensitivity.

 Most allergens are in themselves nonpathogenic and therefore innocuous. Some individuals develop mild allergies,
which are usually treated with antihistamines. Others develop severe allergies that may cause anaphylactic shock, which
can potentially be fatal within 20 to 30 minutes if untreated. This drop in blood pressure (shock) with accompanying
contractions of bronchial smooth muscle is caused by systemic mast cell degranulation when an allergen is eaten (for
example, shellfish and peanuts), injected (by a bee sting or being administered penicillin), or inhaled (asthma). Because
epinephrine raises blood pressure and relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, it is routinely used to counteract the effects of
anaphylaxis and can be lifesaving. Patients with known severe allergies are encouraged to keep automatic epinephrine
injectors with them at all times, especially when away from easy access to hospitals.
