An element
is a pure substance that is distinguished from all other matter by the fact that it cannot be created or broken down by
ordinary chemical means. While your body can assemble many of the chemical compounds needed for life from their
constituent elements, it cannot make elements. They must come from the environment. A familiar example of an element

that you must take in is calcium (Ca**). Calcium is essential to the human body; it is absorbed and used for a number of
processes, including strengthening bones. When you consume dairy products your digestive system breaks down the food
into components small enough to cross into the bloodstream. Among these is calcium, which, because it is an element,
cannot be broken down further. The elemental calcium in cheese, therefore, is the same as the calcium that forms your
bones. Some other elements you might be familiar with are oxygen, sodium, and iron.
