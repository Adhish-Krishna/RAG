What other organ system gets involved, and what part of the brain coordinates the two
systems for the entire response, including epinephrine (adrenaline) and cortisol?

CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 621

15.2 | Autonomic Reflexes and Homeostasis

 By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Compare the structure of somatic and autonomic reflex arcs
¢ Explain the differences in sympathetic and parasympathetic reflexes
¢ Differentiate between short and long reflexes

¢ Determine the effect of the autonomic nervous system on the regulation of the various organ systems on the basis of
the signaling molecules involved
 ¢ Describe the effects of drugs that affect autonomic function

The autonomic nervous system regulates organ systems through circuits that resemble the reflexes described in the somatic
nervous system. The main difference between the somatic and autonomic systems is in what target tissues are effectors.
 Somatic responses are solely based on skeletal muscle contraction. The autonomic system, however, targets cardiac and
smooth muscle, as well as glandular tissue.
