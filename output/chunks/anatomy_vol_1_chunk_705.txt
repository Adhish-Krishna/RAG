The superior articular processes of thoracic vertebrae face anteriorly and the inferior
processes face posteriorly. These orientations are important determinants for the type and range of movements available to
the thoracic region of the vertebral column.

 Thoracic vertebrae have several additional articulation sites, each of which is called a facet, where a rib is attached.
 Most thoracic vertebrae have two facets located on the lateral sides of the body, each of which is called a costal facet (costal
= “tib”). These are for articulation with the head (end) of a rib. An additional facet is located on the transverse process for
articulation with the tubercle of a rib.
