Axons from these ganglionic neurons then project the short distance to those target effectors.

 Chemical Signaling in the Autonomic Nervous System

Where an autonomic neuron connects with a target, there is a synapse. The electrical signal of the action potential causes
the release of a signaling molecule, which will bind to receptor proteins on the target cell. Synapses of the autonomic

system are classified as either cholinergic, meaning that acetylcholine (ACh) is released, or adrenergic, meaning that
norepinephrine is released. The terms cholinergic and adrenergic refer not only to the signaling molecule that is released
but also to the class of receptors that each binds.

 The cholinergic system includes two classes of receptor: the nicotinic receptor and the muscarinic receptor. Both
receptor types bind to ACh and cause changes in the target cell. The nicotinic receptor is a ligand-gated cation channel
and the muscarinic receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor.
