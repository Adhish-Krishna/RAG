It is also called brittle bone disease. The disease is present from birth and affects a person throughout life.

 The genetic mutation that causes OI affects the bodyâ€™s production of collagen, one of the critical components
of bone matrix. The severity of the disease can range from mild to severe. Those with the most severe forms of the
disease sustain many more fractures than those with a mild form. Frequent and multiple fractures typically lead to bone
deformities and short stature. Bowing of the long bones and curvature of the spine are also common in people afflicted
with OI. Curvature of the spine makes breathing difficult because the lungs are compressed.

 Because collagen is such an important structural protein in many parts of the body, people with OI may also
experience fragile skin, weak muscles, loose joints, easy bruising, frequent nosebleeds, brittle teeth, blue sclera, and
hearing loss.
