Figure 15.5 Autonomic Varicosities The connection between autonomic fibers and target effectors is not the same
as the typical synapse, such as the neuromuscular junction. Instead of a synaptic end bulb, a neurotransmitter is
released from swellings along the length of a fiber that makes an extended network of connections in the target effector.

Fight or Flight? What About Fright and Freeze?

The original usage of the epithet “fight or flight” comes from a scientist named Walter Cannon who worked at Harvard
in 1915. The concept of homeostasis and the functioning of the sympathetic system had been introduced in France

preparing to stand and fight or run away.
