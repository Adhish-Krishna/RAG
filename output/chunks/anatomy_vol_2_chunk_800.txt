oxytocin hypothalamic hormone stored in the posterior pituitary gland and important in stimulating uterine contractions
in labor, milk ejection during breastfeeding, and feelings of attachment (also produced in males)

PP cell minor cell type in the pancreas that secretes the hormone pancreatic polypeptide

pancreas organ with both exocrine and endocrine functions located posterior to the stomach that is important for
digestion and the regulation of blood glucose

pancreatic islets specialized clusters of pancreatic cells that have endocrine functions; also called islets of Langerhans
paracrine chemical signal that elicits a response in neighboring cells; also called paracrine factor

parathyroid glands small, round glands embedded in the posterior thyroid gland that produce parathyroid hormone
(PTH)

parathyroid hormone (PTH) peptide hormone produced and secreted by the parathyroid glands in response to low
blood calcium levels

phosphodiesterase (PDE) cytosolic enzyme that deactivates and degrades cAMP

phosphorylation cascade signaling event in which multiple protein kinases phosphorylate the next protein substrate
by transferring a phosphate group from ATP to the protein

pineal gland endocrine gland that secretes melatonin, which is important in regulating the sleep-wake cycle
pinealocyte cell of the pineal gland that produces and secretes the hormone melatonin
pituitary dwarfism disorder in children caused when abnormally low levels of GH result in growth retardation

pituitary gland bean-sized organ suspended from the hypothalamus that produces, stores, and secretes hormones in
response to hypothalamic stimulation (also called hypophysis)

progesterone predominantly female sex hormone important in regulating the female reproductive cycle and the
maintenance of pregnancy

prolactin (PRL) anterior pituitary hormone that promotes development of the mammary glands and the production of
breast milk

protein kinase enzyme that initiates a phosphorylation cascade upon activation

second messenger molecule that initiates a signaling cascade in response to hormone binding on a cell membrane
receptor and activation of a G protein

stage of exhaustion stage three of the general adaptation syndrome; the body’s long-term response to stress mediated
by the hormones of the adrenal cortex

stage of resistance stage two of the general adaptation syndrome; the body’s continued response to stress after stage
one diminishes

testosterone steroid hormone secreted by the male testes and important in the maturation of sperm cells, growth and
development of the male reproductive system, and the development of male secondary sex characteristics

thymosins hormones produced and secreted by the thymus that play an important role in the development and
differentiation of T cells

thymus organ that is involved in the development and maturation of T-cells and is particularly active during infancy and
childhood

thyroid gland large endocrine gland responsible for the synthesis of thyroid hormones

thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) anterior pituitary hormone that triggers secretion of thyroid hormones by the
thyroid gland (also called thyrotropin)

thyroxine (also, tetraiodothyronine, T4) amino acid—derived thyroid hormone that is more abundant but less potent than
T3 and often converted to T3 by target cells

triiodothyronine (also, T3) amino acid—derived thyroid hormone that is less abundant but more potent than T4

upregulation increase in the number of hormone receptors, typically in response to chronically reduced levels of a
hormone

zona fasciculata intermediate region of the adrenal cortex that produce hormones called glucocorticoids

zona glomerulosa most superficial region of the adrenal cortex, which produces the hormones collectively referred to
as mineralocorticoids

zona reticularis deepest region of the adrenal cortex, which produces the steroid sex hormones called androgens
CHAPTER REVIEW

17.1 An Overview of the Endocrine System

The endocrine system consists of cells, tissues, and organs that secrete hormones critical to homeostasis.
