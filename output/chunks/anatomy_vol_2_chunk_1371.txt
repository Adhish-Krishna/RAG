The secondary adaptive response often eliminates a pathogen before it can cause
significant tissue damage or any symptoms. Without symptoms, there is no disease, and the individual is not even aware
of the infection. This secondary response is the basis of immunological memory, which protects us from getting diseases
repeatedly from the same pathogen. By this mechanism, an individualâ€™s exposure to pathogens early in life spares the person
from these diseases later in life.

 Self Recognition

A third important feature of the adaptive immune response is its ability to distinguish between self-antigens, those that are
normally present in the body, and foreign antigens, those that might be on a potential pathogen. As T and B cells mature,
there are mechanisms in place that prevent them from recognizing self-antigen, preventing a damaging immune response
against the body. These mechanisms are not 100 percent effective, however, and their breakdown leads to autoimmune
diseases, which will be discussed later in this chapter.
