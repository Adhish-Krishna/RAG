Another way of saying this is: If plasma osmolarity
rises, more water is recovered and urine volume decreases; if plasma osmolarity decreases, less water is recovered and urine
volume increases. This function is regulated by the posterior pituitary hormone ADH (vasopressin). With mild dehydration,
plasma osmolarity rises slightly. This increase is detected by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, which stimulates the
release of ADH from the posterior pituitary. If plasma osmolarity decreases slightly, the opposite occurs.
 When stimulated by ADH, aquaporin channels are inserted into the apical membrane of principal cells, which line
the collecting ducts. As the ducts descend through the medulla, the osmolarity surrounding them increases (due to the
countercurrent mechanisms described above). If aquaporin water channels are present, water will be osmotically pulled
rom the collecting duct into the surrounding interstitial space and into the peritubular capillaries. Therefore, the final urine

will be more concentrated.
