The first group is
the organs that make up the alimentary canal. Accessory digestive organs comprise the second group and are critical for
orchestrating the breakdown of food and the assimilation of its nutrients into the body. Accessory digestive organs, despite
their name, are critical to the function of the digestive system.

 Alimentary Canal Organs

Also called the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or gut, the alimentary canal (aliment- = “to nourish”) is a one-way tube about
7.62 meters (25 feet) in length during life and closer to 10.67 meters (35 feet) in length when measured after death, once
smooth muscle tone is lost. The main function of the organs of the alimentary canal is to nourish the body. This tube
begins at the mouth and terminates at the anus. Between those two points, the canal is modified as the pharynx, esophagus,
stomach, and small and large intestines to fit the functional needs of the body.
