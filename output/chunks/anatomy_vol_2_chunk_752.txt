In addition, PTH initiates the production of the steroid hormone calcitriol (also known as
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D), which is the active form of vitamin D3, in the kidneys. Calcitriol then stimulates increased
absorption of dietary calcium by the intestines. A negative feedback loop regulates the levels of PTH, with rising blood
calcium levels inhibiting further release of PTH.
