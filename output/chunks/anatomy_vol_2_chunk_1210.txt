Eventually, even the best-trained athletes will fatigue
and must undergo a period of rest following exercise. Cardiac output and distribution of blood then return to normal.

 Regular exercise promotes cardiovascular health in a variety of ways. Because an athlete’s heart is larger than a
nonathlete’s, stroke volume increases, so the athletic heart can deliver the same amount of blood as the nonathletic heart but
with a lower heart rate. This increased efficiency allows the athlete to exercise for longer periods of time before muscles
fatigue and places less stress on the heart. Exercise also lowers overall cholesterol levels by removing from the circulation
a complex form of cholesterol, triglycerides, and proteins known as low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), which are widely
associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Although there is no way to remove deposits of plaque from the
walls of arteries other than specialized surgery, exercise does promote the health of vessels by decreasing the rate of plaque
formation and reducing blood pressure, so the heart does not have to generate as much force to overcome resistance.
