 Figure 2.4 The Periodic Table of the Elements (credit: R.A. Dragoset, A. Musgrove, C.W. Clark, W.C. Martin)

Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/ptable) to view the periodic table. In the periodic table of the
elements, elements in a single row have the same number of electrons that can participate in a chemical reaction.
 These electrons are known as “valence electrons.” For example, the elements in the first row all have a single valence
electron, an electron that can be “donated” in a chemical reaction with another atom.
