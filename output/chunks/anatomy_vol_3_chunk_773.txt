The dramatic changes of fertilization, embryonic development, and fetal
development are followed by remarkable adaptations of the newborn to life outside the womb. An offspring’s normal
development depends upon the appropriate synthesis of structural and functional proteins. This, in turn, is governed by the
genetic material inherited from the parental egg and sperm, as well as environmental factors.

 28.1 | Fertilization

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the obstacles that sperm must overcome to reach an oocyte
¢ Explain capacitation and its importance in fertilization
¢ Summarize the events that occur as a sperm fertilizes an oocyte

Fertilization occurs when a sperm and an oocyte (egg) combine and their nuclei fuse. Because each of these reproductive
cells is a haploid cell containing half of the genetic material needed to form a human being, their combination forms a
diploid cell.
