Testosterone negatively
feeds back to the
hypothalamus and
pituitary, inhibiting
further release of
GnRH, FSH, and LH.

LH stimulates

the Leydig cells to
release testosterone.
 FSH stimulates the
Sertoli cells to release
ABP. ABP binds to
testosterone, keeping
the latter at a high
concentration.

Figure 27.8 Regulation of Testosterone Production The hypothalamus and pituitary gland regulate the production
of testosterone and the cells that assist in spermatogenesis. GnRH activates the anterior pituitary to produce LH
and FSH, which in turn stimulate Leydig cells and Sertoli cells, respectively. The system is a negative feedback loop
because the end products of the pathway, testosterone and inhibin, interact with the activity of GnRH to inhibit their
own production.
