anatomical underpinnings. The German neurologist and histologist Korbinian Brodmann, who made a careful study of the
cytoarchitecture of the cerebrum around the turn of the nineteenth century, described approximately 50 regions of the
cortex that differed enough from each other to be considered separate areas (Figure 16.4). Brodmann made preparations

of many dif:

of neurons to find anatomical differences in the various parts of the cerebral cortex. Continued investigation into these
anatomical areas over the subsequent 100 or more years has demonstrated a strong correlation between the structures and the
functions attributed to those structures. For example, the first three areas in Brodmann’s list—which are in the postcentral

gyrus—com,

anguage function, and they can be subdivided on the basis of the particular part of language function that each

sis for parceling out areas of the cortex and attributing them to various functions has its root in pure

erent regions of the cerebral cortex to view with a microscope.
