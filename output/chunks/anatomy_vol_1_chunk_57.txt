The three basic classes of nutrients are
water, the energy-yielding and body-building nutrients, and the micronutrients (vitamins and minerals).

 The most critical nutrient is water. Depending on the environmental temperature and our state of health, we may be
able to survive for only a few days without water. The body’s functional chemicals are dissolved and transported in water,
and the chemical reactions of life take place in water. Moreover, water is the largest component of cells, blood, and the
fluid between cells, and water makes up about 70 percent of an adult’s body mass. Water also helps regulate our internal
temperature and cushions, protects, and lubricates joints and many other body structures.

 The energy-yielding nutrients are primarily carbohydrates and lipids, while proteins mainly supply the amino acids
that are the building blocks of the body itself.
