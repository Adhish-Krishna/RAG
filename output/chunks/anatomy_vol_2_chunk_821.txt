The heart pumps blood throughout the body in a network of blood vessels. Together, these
three components—blood, heart, and vessels—makes up the cardiovascular system. This chapter focuses on the medium of
transport: blood.

 18.1 | An Overview of Blood

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Identify the primary functions of blood in transportation, defense, and maintenance of homeostasis

* Name the fluid component of blood and the three major types of formed elements, and identify their relative
proportions in a blood sample

¢ Discuss the unique physical characteristics of blood
¢ Identify the composition of blood plasma, including its most important solutes and plasma proteins

Recall that blood is a connective tissue. Like all connective tissues, it is made up of cellular elements and an extracellular
matrix. The cellular elements—referred to as the formed elements—include red blood cells (RBCs), white blood
cells (WBCs), and cell fragments called platelets.
