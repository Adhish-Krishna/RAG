MIs
may be triggered by excessive exercise, in which the partially occluded artery is no longer able to pump sufficient
quantities of blood, or severe stress, which may induce spasm of the smooth muscle in the walls of the vessel.

 In the case of acute MI, there is often sudden pain beneath the sternum (retrosternal pain) called angina pectoris,
often radiating down the left arm in males but not in female patients. Until this anomaly between the sexes was
discovered, many female patients suffering MIs were misdiagnosed and sent home. In addition, patients typically
present with difficulty breathing and shortness of breath (dyspnea), irregular heartbeat (palpations), nausea and
vomiting, sweating (diaphoresis), anxiety, and fainting (syncope), although not all of these symptoms may be present.
