A formal mental status exam is not needed at this point;
the patient will demonstrate any possible deficits in that area during normal interactions with the interviewer. If cognitive
or language deficits are apparent, the interviewer can pursue mental status in more depth. All of this takes place in less than
5 minutes. The patient reports that he feels pins and needles in his left arm and leg, and has trouble feeling the tip of the
pen when he is touched on those limbs. This suggests a problem with the sensory systems between the spinal cord and the
brain. The emergency department has a lead to follow before a CT scan is performed. He is put on aspirin therapy to limit
the possibility of blood clots forming, in case the cause is an embolus—an obstruction such as a blood clot that blocks the
flow of blood in an artery or vein.

of tests that can be performed rapidly when a patient is initially brought into an emergency department.
