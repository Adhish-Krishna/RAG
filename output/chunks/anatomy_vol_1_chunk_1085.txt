Figure 10.22 Cardiac Muscle _ Intercalated discs are part of the cardiac muscle sarcolemma and they contain gap
junctions and desmosomes.

 Contractions of the heart (heartbeats) are controlled by specialized cardiac muscle cells called pacemaker cells that
directly control heart rate. Although cardiac muscle cannot be consciously controlled, the pacemaker cells respond to signals
from the autonomic nervous system (ANS) to speed up or slow down the heart rate. The pacemaker cells can also respond
to various hormones that modulate heart rate to control blood pressure.

 The wave of contraction that allows the heart to work as a unit, called a functional syncytium, begins with the
pacemaker cells. This group of cells is self-excitable and able to depolarize to threshold and fire action potentials on their
own, a feature called autorhythmicity; they do this at set intervals which determine heart rate.
