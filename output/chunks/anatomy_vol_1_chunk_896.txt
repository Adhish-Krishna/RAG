This
gives the bones of a synovial joint the ability to move smoothly against each other, allowing for increased joint mobility.

Figure 9.8 Synovial Joints Synovial joints allow for smooth movements between the adjacent bones. The joint is
surrounded by an articular capsule that defines a joint cavity filled with synovial fluid. The articulating surfaces of the
bones are covered by a thin layer of articular cartilage. Ligaments support the joint by holding the bones together and
resisting excess or abnormal joint motions.

 Structural Features of Synovial Joints

Synovial joints are characterized by the presence of a joint cavity. The walls of this space are formed by the articular
capsule, a fibrous connective tissue structure that is attached to each bone just outside the area of the boneâ€™s articulating
surface.
