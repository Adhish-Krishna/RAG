Hair loss can also result from the
aging process, or the influence of hormones.

 Hair Color

Similar to the skin, hair gets its color from the pigment melanin, produced by melanocytes in the hair papilla. Different
hair color results from differences in the type of melanin, which is genetically determined. As a person ages, the melanin
production decreases, and hair tends to lose its color and becomes gray and/or white.

 Nails

The nail bed is a specialized structure of the epidermis that is found at the tips of our fingers and toes. The nail body is
ormed on the nail bed, and protects the tips of our fingers and toes as they are the farthest extremities and the parts of
the body that experience the maximum mechanical stress (Figure 5.13). In addition, the nail body forms a back-support for
picking up small objects with the fingers. The nail body is composed of densely packed dead keratinocytes. The epidermis
in this part of the body has evolved a specialized structure upon which nails can form.
