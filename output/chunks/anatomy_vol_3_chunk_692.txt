In men, LH binds to receptors on Leydig cells in the
testes and upregulates the production of testosterone.

 A negative feedback loop predominantly controls the synthesis and secretion of both FSH and LH. Low blood
concentrations of testosterone stimulate the hypothalamic release of GnRH. GnRH then stimulates the anterior pituitary
to secrete LH into the bloodstream. In the testis, LH binds to LH receptors on Leydig cells and stimulates the release of
testosterone. When concentrations of testosterone in the blood reach a critical threshold, testosterone itself will bind to
androgen receptors on both the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary, inhibiting the synthesis and secretion of GnRH and
LH, respectively. When the blood concentrations of testosterone once again decline, testosterone no longer interacts with
the receptors to the same degree and GnRH and LH are once again secreted, stimulating more testosterone production. This
same process occurs with FSH and inhibin to control spermatogenesis.

Declines in Leydig cell activity can occur in men beginning at 40 to 50 years of age.
