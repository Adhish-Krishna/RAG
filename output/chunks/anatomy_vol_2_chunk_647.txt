The left and right anterior corticospinal tracts are
directly adjacent to each other. The likelihood of trauma to the spinal cord resulting in a hemisection that affects one
anterior column, but not the other, is very unlikely. Either the axial musculature will not be affected at all, or there will
be bilateral losses in the trunk.

 Sensory discrimination can pinpoint the level of damage in the spinal cord. Below the hemisection, pain stimuli
will be perceived in the damaged side, but not fine touch. The opposite is true on the other side. The pain fibers on
the side with motor function cross the midline in the spinal cord and ascend in the contralateral lateral column as far
as the hemisection. The dorsal column will be intact ipsilateral to the source on the intact side and reach the brain for
conscious perception. The trauma would be at the level just before sensory discrimination returns to normal, helping to
pinpoint the trauma.
