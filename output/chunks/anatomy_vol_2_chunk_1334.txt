Bone Marrow

In the embryo, blood cells are made in the yolk sac. As development proceeds, this function is taken over by the spleen,
lymph nodes, and liver. Later, the bone marrow takes over most hematopoietic functions, although the final stages of the
differentiation of some cells may take place in other organs. The red bone marrow is a loose collection of cells where
hematopoiesis occurs, and the yellow bone marrow is a site of energy storage, which consists largely of fat cells (Figure
21.6). The B cell undergoes nearly all of its development in the red bone marrow, whereas the immature T cell, called a
thymocyte, leaves the bone marrow and matures largely in the thymus gland.
