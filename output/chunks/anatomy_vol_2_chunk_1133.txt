These make the capillary permeable to larger molecules. The number of fenestrations and their degree of permeability vary,
however, according to their location. Fenestrated capillaries are common in the small intestine, which is the primary site of
nutrient absorption, as well as in the kidneys, which filter the blood. They are also found in the choroid plexus of the brain
and many endocrine structures, including the hypothalamus, pituitary, pineal, and thyroid glands.

 Sinusoid Capillaries

A sinusoid capillary (or sinusoid) is the least common type of capillary. Sinusoid capillaries are flattened, and they
have extensive intercellular gaps and incomplete basement membranes, in addition to intercellular clefts and fenestrations.
 This gives them an appearance not unlike Swiss cheese. These very large openings allow for the passage of the largest
molecules, including plasma proteins and even cells. Blood flow through sinusoids is very slow, allowing more time for
exchange of gases, nutrients, and wastes.
