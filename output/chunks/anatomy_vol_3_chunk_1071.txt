Excessive milk supply creates
breast engorgement and leakage. 44 By using large sample sizes, Mendel minimized the effect of random variability resulting
from chance. This allowed him to identify true ratios corresponding to dominant-recessive inheritance. 45 The only way an
affected daughter could be born is if the female carrier mated with a male who was affected. In this case, 50 percent of the daughters
would be affected. Alternatively, but exceedingly unlikely, the daughter could become affected by a spontaneous mutation.
