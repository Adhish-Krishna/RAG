Much
of the function of the autonomic system is based on the connections within an autonomic, or visceral, reflex.

 15.1 | Divisions of the Autonomic Nervous System

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

* Name the components that generate the sympathetic and parasympathetic responses of the autonomic nervous
system

¢ Explain the differences in output connections within the two divisions of the autonomic nervous system

¢ Describe the signaling molecules and receptor proteins involved in communication within the two divisions of the
autonomic nervous system

The nervous system can be divided into two functional parts: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous
system. The major differences between the two systems are evident in the responses that each produces. The somatic
nervous system causes contraction of skeletal muscles. The autonomic nervous system controls cardiac and smooth muscle,
as well as glandular tissue. The somatic nervous system is associated with voluntary responses (though many can happen
without conscious awareness, like breathing), and the autonomic nervous system is associated with involuntary responses,
such as those related to homeostasis.
