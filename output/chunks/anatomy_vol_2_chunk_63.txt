Unipolar neuron

Multipolar neuron

Figure 12.9 Neuron Classification by Shape Unipolar cells have one process that includes both the axon and
dendrite. Bipolar cells have two processes, the axon and a dendrite. Multipolar cells have more than two processes,
the axon and two or more dendrites.

 Unipolar cells have only one process emerging from the cell. True unipolar cells are only found in invertebrate
animals, so the unipolar cells in humans are more appropriately called “pseudo-unipolar” cells. Invertebrate unipolar cells
do not have dendrites. Human unipolar cells have an axon that emerges from the cell body, but it splits so that the
axon can extend along a very long distance. At one end of the axon are dendrites, and at the other end, the axon forms
synaptic connections with a target. Unipolar cells are exclusively sensory neurons and have two unique characteristics. First,
their dendrites are receiving sensory information, sometimes directly from the stimulus itself.
