However, the papillary muscles
also contract, placing tension on the chordae tendineae and holding the atrioventricular valves (tricuspid and mitral) in place to
prevent the valves from prolapsing and being forced back into the atria. The semilunar valves (pulmonary and aortic) lack chordae
tendineae and papillary muscles, but do not face the same pressure gradients as do the atrioventricular valves. As the ventricles
relax and pressure drops within the ventricles, there is a tendency for the blood to flow backward. However, the valves, consisting
of reinforced endothelium and connective tissue, fill with blood and seal off the opening preventing the return of blood. 28
The pulmonary circuit consists of blood flowing to and from the lungs, whereas the systemic circuit carries blood to and from
the entire body. The systemic circuit is far more extensive, consisting of far more vessels and offers much greater resistance to
the flow of blood, so the heart must generate a higher pressure to overcome this resistance.
