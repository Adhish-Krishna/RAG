The sagittal suture runs
at the midline on the top of the skull. It unites the right and left parietal bones with each other. The squamous suture is a curved
suture located on the lateral side of the skull. It unites the squamous portion of the temporal bone to the parietal bone. The lambdoid
suture is located on the posterior skull and has an inverted V-shape. It unites the occipital bone with the right and left parietal
bones. 31 The anterior cranial fossa is the shallowest of the three cranial fossae. It extends from the frontal bone anteriorly to the
lesser wing of the sphenoid bone posteriorly. It is divided at the midline by the crista galli and cribriform plates of the ethmoid
bone. The middle cranial fossa is located in the central skull, and is deeper than the anterior fossa. The middle fossa extends from
the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone anteriorly to the petrous ridge posteriorly. It is divided at the midline by the sella turcica.
