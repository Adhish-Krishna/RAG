This drug is nicotine. The effects of nicotine on the autonomic nervous system are important in considering the role
smoking can play in health.

 All ganglionic neurons of the autonomic system, in both sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia, are activated by
ACh released from preganglionic fibers. The ACh receptors on these neurons are of the nicotinic type, meaning that they are
ligand-gated ion channels. When the neurotransmitter released from the preganglionic fiber binds to the receptor protein, a
channel opens to allow positive ions to cross the cell membrane. The result is depolarization of the ganglia. Nicotine acts
as an ACh analog at these synapses, so when someone takes in the drug, it binds to these ACh receptors and activates the
ganglionic neurons, causing them to depolarize.

 Ganglia of both divisions are activated equally by the drug. For many target organs in the body, this results in no
net change. The competing inputs to the system cancel each other out and nothing significant happens.
