These layers are depicted in a
longitudinal cross-section of the hair follicle (Figure 5.12), although not all hair has a medullary layer. Hair texture (straight,
curly) is determined by the shape and structure of the cortex, and to the extent that it is present, the medulla. The shape and
structure of these layers are, in turn, determined by the shape of the hair follicle. Hair growth begins with the production of
keratinocytes by the basal cells of the hair bulb. As new cells are deposited at the hair bulb, the hair shaft is pushed through
the follicle toward the surface. Keratinization is completed as the cells are pushed to the skin surface to form the shaft of
hair that is externally visible. The external hair is completely dead and composed entirely of keratin. For this reason, our
hair does not have sensation. Furthermore, you can cut your hair or shave without damaging the hair structure because the
cut is superficial.
