Figure 27.15 Hormone Levels in Ovarian and Menstrual Cycles The correlation of the hormone levels and their
effects on the female reproductive system is shown in this timeline of the ovarian and menstrual cycles. The menstrual
cycle begins at day one with the start of menses. Ovulation occurs around day 14 of a 28-day cycle, triggered by the
LH surge.

1226 CHAPTER 27 | THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM

Proliferative Phase

Once menstrual flow ceases, the endometrium begins to proliferate again, marking the beginning of the proliferative phase
of the menstrual cycle (see Figure 27.15). It occurs when the granulosa and theca cells of the tertiary follicles begin to
produce increased amounts of estrogen. These rising estrogen concentrations stimulate the endometrial lining to rebuild.
 Recall that the high estrogen concentrations will eventually lead to a decrease in FSH as a result of negative feedback,
resulting in atresia of all but one of the developing tertiary follicles.
