Together these
articulations form the temporomandibular joint, which allows for opening and closing of the mouth (see Figure 7.5). The
broad U-shaped curve located between the coronoid and condylar processes is the mandibular notch.

Important landmarks for the mandible include the following:

¢ Alveolar process of the mandible—This is the upper border of the mandibular body and serves to anchor the lower
teeth.

 * Mental protuberance—The forward projection from the inferior margin of the anterior mandible that forms the chin
(mental = “chin”).

* Mental foramen—The opening located on each side of the anterior-lateral mandible, which is the exit site for a
sensory nerve that supplies the chin.

 * Mylohyoid line—This bony ridge extends along the inner aspect of the mandibular body (see Figure 7.11). The
muscle that forms the floor of the oral cavity attaches to the mylohyoid lines on both sides of the mandible.
