Light with a wavelength of 380 nm is blue whereas light with a
wavelength of 720 nm is dark red. All other colors fall between red and blue at various points along the wavelength scale.

 Opsin pigments are actually transmembrane proteins that contain a cofactor known as retinal. Retinal is a hydrocarbon
molecule related to vitamin A. When a photon hits retinal, the long hydrocarbon chain of the molecule is biochemically
altered. Specifically, photons cause some of the double-bonded carbons within the chain to switch from a cis to a trans

conformation. This process is called photoisomerization. Before interacting with a photon, retinalâ€™s flexible double-bonded
carbons are in the cis conformation. This molecule is referred to as 11-cis-retinal. A photon interacting with the molecule
causes the flexible double-bonded carbons to change to the trans- conformation, forming all-trans-retinal, which has a
straight hydrocarbon chain (Figure 14.17).
