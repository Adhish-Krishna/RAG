The large inferior nasal concha is an
independent bone, while the middle and superior conchae are parts of the ethmoid bone. The nasal septum is formed by the
perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone, the vomer bone, and the septal cartilage. The paranasal sinuses are air-filled spaces
located within the frontal, maxillary, sphenoid, and ethmoid bones.

 On the lateral skull, the zygomatic arch consists of two parts, the temporal process of the zygomatic bone anteriorly
and the zygomatic process of the temporal bone posteriorly. The temporal fossa is the shallow space located on the lateral
skull above the level of the zygomatic arch. The infratemporal fossa is located below the zygomatic arch and deep to the
ramus of the mandible.

 The hyoid bone is located in the upper neck and does not join with any other bone. It is held in position by muscles
and serves to support the tongue above, the larynx below, and the pharynx posteriorly.
