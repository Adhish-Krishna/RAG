Similarly, certain cells send chemical signals to other cells in the body that influence their behavior. This long-distance
intercellular communication, coordination, and control is critical for homeostasis, and it is the fundamental function of the
endocrine system.

 17.1 | An Overview of the Endocrine System

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 ¢ Distinguish the types of intercellular communication, their importance, mechanisms, and effects
¢ Identify the major organs and tissues of the endocrine system and their location in the body

Communication is a process in which a sender transmits signals to one or more receivers to control and coordinate actions.
 In the human body, two major organ systems participate in relatively “long distance” communication: the nervous system
and the endocrine system. Together, these two systems are primarily responsible for maintaining homeostasis in the body.

 Neural and Endocrine Signaling

The nervous system uses two types of intercellular communication—electrical and chemical signaling—either by the direct
action of an electrical potential, or in the latter case, through the action of chemical neurotransmitters such as serotonin or
norepinephrine.
