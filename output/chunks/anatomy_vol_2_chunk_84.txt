Imagine you are about to take a shower in the morning before going to school. You have turned on the faucet to start
the water as you prepare to get in the shower. After a few minutes, you expect the water to be a temperature that will be
comfortable to enter. So you put your hand out into the spray of water. What happens next depends on how your nervous
system interacts with the stimulus of the water temperature and what you do in response to that stimulus.

 Found in the skin of your fingers or toes is a type of sensory receptor that is sensitive to temperature, called a
thermoreceptor. When you place your hand under the shower (Figure 12.15), the cell membrane of the thermoreceptors
changes its electrical state (voltage). The amount of change is dependent on the strength of the stimulus (how hot the water
is). This is called a graded potential. If the stimulus is strong, the voltage of the cell membrane will change enough to
generate an electrical signal that will travel down the axon.
