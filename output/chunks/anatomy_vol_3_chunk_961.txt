These allow the hand to conform to objects being held. These arches maximize the amount
of surface contact between the hand and object, which enhances stability and increases sensory input. 3 Surgery may be required
if the fracture is unstable, meaning that the broken ends of the radius wonâ€™t stay in place to allow for proper healing. In this case,
metal plates and screws can be used to stabilize the fractured bone. 4 The obturator foramen is located between the ischium and
the pubis. The superior and inferior pubic rami contribute to the boundaries of the obturator foramen. 5 A hole is drilled into the
greater trochanter, the bone marrow (medullary) space inside the femur is enlarged, and finally an intramedullary rod is inserted
into the femur. This rod is then anchored to the bone with screws. 6 Metal cutting jigs are attached to the bones to ensure that
the bones are cut properly prior to the attachment of prosthetic components.
