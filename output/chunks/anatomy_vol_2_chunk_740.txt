The following steps outline the hormones’ assembly:
1. Binding of TSH to its receptors in the follicle cells of the thyroid gland causes the cells to actively transport iodide
ions (I) across their cell membrane, from the bloodstream into the cytosol. As a result, the concentration of iodide
ions “trapped” in the follicular cells is many times higher than the concentration in the bloodstream.

2. Iodide ions then move to the lumen of the follicle cells that border the colloid. There, the ions undergo oxidation (their

negatively charged electrons are removed). The oxidation of two iodide ions (2 I’) results in iodine (12), which passes
through the follicle cell membrane into the colloid.

3. In the colloid, peroxidase enzymes link the iodine to the tyrosine amino acids in thyroglobulin to produce two
intermediaries: a tyrosine attached to one iodine and a tyrosine attached to two iodines.
