The
autonomic system does not cause the heart to beat, it just speeds it up (sympathetic) or slows it down (parasympathetic).
 The mechanisms for this are not mutually exclusive, so the heart receives conflicting signals, and the rhythm of the heart
can be affected (Figure 15.13).

Figure 15.13 Autonomic Connections to Heart and Blood Vessels The nicotinic receptor is found on all autonomic
ganglia, but the cardiovascular connections are particular, and do not conform to the usual competitive projections
that would just cancel each other out when stimulated by nicotine.
