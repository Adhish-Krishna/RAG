CHAPTER 24 | METABOLISM AND NUTRITION

Krebs cycle is also commonly called the citric acid cycle or the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. During the Krebs cycle,
high-energy molecules, including ATP, NADH, and FADHg, are created. NADH and FADH? then pass electrons through
the electron transport chain in the mitochondria to generate more ATP molecules.
