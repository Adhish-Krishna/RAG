Structure of Formed Sperm

Sperm are smaller than most cells in the body; in fact, the volume of a sperm cell is 85,000 times less than that of the female
gamete. Approximately 100 to 300 million sperm are produced each day, whereas women typically ovulate only one oocyte
per month as is true for most cells in the body, the structure of sperm cells speaks to their function. Sperm have a distinctive
head, mid-piece, and tail region (Figure 27.6). The head of the sperm contains the extremely compact haploid nucleus
with very little cytoplasm. These qualities contribute to the overall small size of the sperm (the head is only 5 pm long).
 A structure called the acrosome covers most of the head of the sperm cell as a “cap” that is filled with lysosomal enzymes
important for preparing sperm to participate in fertilization.
