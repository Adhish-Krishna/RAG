CHAPTER 1] AN INTRODUCTION TO THE HUMAN BODY 33

Subdivisions of the Posterior (Dorsal) and Anterior (Ventral) Cavities

The posterior (dorsal) and anterior (ventral) cavities are each subdivided into smaller cavities. In the posterior (dorsal)
cavity, the cranial cavity houses the brain, and the spinal cavity (or vertebral cavity) encloses the spinal cord. Just as the
brain and spinal cord make up a continuous, uninterrupted structure, the cranial and spinal cavities that house them are also
continuous. The brain and spinal cord are protected by the bones of the skull and vertebral column and by cerebrospinal
fluid, a colorless fluid produced by the brain, which cushions the brain and spinal cord within the posterior (dorsal) cavity.
