The cells of the zona fasciculata produce hormones called glucocorticoids
because of their role in glucose metabolism. The most important of these is cortisol, some of which the liver converts
to cortisone. A glucocorticoid produced in much smaller amounts is corticosterone. In response to long-term stressors,
the hypothalamus secretes CRH, which in turn triggers the release of ACTH by the anterior pituitary. ACTH triggers the
release of the glucocorticoids. Their overall effect is to inhibit tissue building while stimulating the breakdown of stored
nutrients to maintain adequate fuel supplies. In conditions of long-term stress, for example, cortisol promotes the catabolism
of glycogen to glucose, the catabolism of stored triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol, and the catabolism of muscle
proteins into amino acids. These raw materials can then be used to synthesize additional glucose and ketones for use as body
uels. The hippocampus, which is part of the temporal lobe of the cerebral cortices and important in memory formation, is
highly sensitive to stress levels because of its many glucocorticoid receptors.
