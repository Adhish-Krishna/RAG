The ganglion is an enlargement of the nerve
root. Under microscopic inspection, it can be seen to include the cell bodies of the neurons, as well as bundles of fibers
that are the posterior nerve root (Figure 13.19). The cells of the dorsal root ganglion are unipolar cells, classifying them
by shape. Also, the small round nuclei of satellite cells can be seen surrounding—as if they were orbiting—the neuron cell
bodies.

Figure 13.19 Dorsal Root Ganglion The cell bodies of sensory neurons, which are unipolar neurons by shape, are
seen in this photomicrograph. Also, the fibrous region is composed of the axons of these neurons that are passing
through the ganglion to be part of the dorsal nerve root (tissue source: canine). LM x 40. (Micrograph provided by the

a section of the dorsal root ganglion (see also Figure 13.19) (tissue source: canine).
