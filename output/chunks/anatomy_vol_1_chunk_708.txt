It is formed by the fusion of five sacral vertebrae, a
process that does not begin until after the age of 20. On the anterior surface of the older adult sacrum, the lines of vertebral
fusion can be seen as four transverse ridges. On the posterior surface, running down the midline, is the median sacral crest,
a bumpy ridge that is the remnant of the fused spinous processes (median = “midline”; while medial = “toward, but not
necessarily at, the midline”). Similarly, the fused transverse processes of the sacral vertebrae form the lateral sacral crest.

 The sacral promontory is the anterior lip of the superior base of the sacrum. Lateral to this is the roughened auricular
surface, which joins with the ilium portion of the hipbone to form the immobile sacroiliac joints of the pelvis. Passing
inferiorly through the sacrum is a bony tunnel called the sacral canal, which terminates at the sacral hiatus near the inferior
tip of the sacrum.
