The name pia mater comes from the Latin for “tender mother,”
suggesting the thin membrane is a gentle covering for the brain. The pia extends into every convolution of the CNS, lining
the inside of the sulci in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. At the end of the spinal cord, a thin filament extends from the
inferior end of CNS at the upper lumbar region of the vertebral column to the sacral end of the vertebral column. Because the
spinal cord does not extend through the lower lumbar region of the vertebral column, a needle can be inserted through the
dura and arachnoid layers to withdraw CSF. This procedure is called a lumbar puncture and avoids the risk of damaging
the central tissue of the spinal cord. Blood vessels that are nourishing the central nervous tissue are between the pia mater
and the nervous tissue.
