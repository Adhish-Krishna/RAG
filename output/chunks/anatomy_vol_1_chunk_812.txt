Forensic Pathology and Forensic Anthropology

A forensic pathologist (also known as a medical examiner) is a medically trained physician who has been specifically
trained in pathology to examine the bodies of the deceased to determine the cause of death. A forensic pathologist
applies his or her understanding of disease as well as toxins, blood and DNA analysis, firearms and ballistics, and
other factors to assess the cause and manner of death. At times, a forensic pathologist will be called to testify under
oath in situations that involve a possible crime. Forensic pathology is a field that has received much media attention
on television shows or following a high-profile death.

 While forensic pathologists are responsible for determining whether the cause of someoneâ€™s death was natural,
a suicide, accidental, or a homicide, there are times when uncovering the cause of death is more complex, and
other skills are needed.
