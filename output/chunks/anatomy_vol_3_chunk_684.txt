A surgical procedure called circumcision, often performed for religious or social reasons, removes
the prepuce, typically within days of birth.
 Both sexual arousal and REM sleep (during which dreaming occurs) can induce an erection. Penile erections are the
result of vasocongestion, or engorgement of the tissues because of more arterial blood flowing into the penis than is leaving
in the veins. During sexual arousal, nitric oxide (NO) is released from nerve endings near blood vessels within the corpora
cavernosa and spongiosum. Release of NO activates a signaling pathway that results in relaxation of the smooth muscles
that surround the penile arteries, causing them to dilate. This dilation increases the amount of blood that can enter the penis
and induces the endothelial cells in the penile arterial walls to also secrete NO and perpetuate the vasodilation. The rapid
increase in blood volume fills the erectile chambers, and the increased pressure of the filled chambers compresses the thin-
walled penile venules, preventing venous drainage of the penis.
