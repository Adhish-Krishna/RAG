In the case of severe septal defects, including both tetralogy of Fallot and patent foramen ovale, failure of the
heart to develop properly can lead to a condition commonly known as a “blue baby.” Regardless of normal skin
pigmentation, individuals with this condition have an insufficient supply of oxygenated blood, which leads to cyanosis,
a blue or purple coloration of the skin, especially when active.

Septal defects are commonly first detected through auscultation, listening to the chest using a stethoscope. In this
case, instead of hearing normal heart sounds attributed to the flow of blood and closing of heart valves, unusual heart
sounds may be detected. This is often followed by medical imaging to confirm or rule out a diagnosis. In many cases,
treatment may not be needed. Some common congenital heart defects are illustrated in Figure 19.10.
