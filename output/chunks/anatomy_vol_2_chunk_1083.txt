These factors are
summarized in Table 19.1 and Table 19.2.

Preload

Preload is another way of expressing EDV. Therefore, the greater the EDV is, the greater the preload is. One of the primary
factors to consider is filling time, or the duration of ventricular diastole during which filling occurs. The more rapidly the
heart contracts, the shorter the filling time becomes, and the lower the EDV and preload are. This effect can be partially
overcome by increasing the second variable, contractility, and raising SV, but over time, the heart is unable to compensate
for decreased filling time, and preload also decreases.

 With increasing ventricular filling, both EDV or preload increase, and the cardiac muscle itself is stretched to a greater
degree. At rest, there is little stretch of the ventricular muscle, and the sarcomeres remain short. With increased ventricular
filling, the ventricular muscle is increasingly stretched and the sarcomere length increases.
