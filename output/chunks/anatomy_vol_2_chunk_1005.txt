The
anterior cardiac veins parallel the small cardiac arteries and drain the anterior surface of the right ventricle. Unlike these
other cardiac veins, it bypasses the coronary sinus and drains directly into the right atrium.

Heart: Coronary Artery Disease

Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. It occurs when the buildup of plaque—a fatty material
including cholesterol, connective tissue, white blood cells, and some smooth muscle cells—within the walls of the
arteries obstructs the flow of blood and decreases the flexibility or compliance of the vessels. This condition is called
atherosclerosis, a hardening of the arteries that involves the accumulation of plaque. As the coronary blood vessels
become occluded, the flow of blood to the tissues will be restricted, a condition called ischemia that causes the cells
to receive insufficient amounts of oxygen, called hypoxia.
