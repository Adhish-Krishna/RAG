The cardioaccelerator regions stimulate activity via sympathetic stimulation of the cardioaccelerator nerves, and
the cardioinhibitory centers decrease heart activity via parasympathetic stimulation as one component of the vagus nerve,
cranial nerve X. During rest, both centers provide slight stimulation to the heart, contributing to autonomic tone. This is
a similar concept to tone in skeletal muscles. Normally, vagal stimulation predominates as, left unregulated, the SA node
would initiate a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm.

 Both sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulations flow through a paired complex network of nerve fibers known
as the cardiac plexus near the base of the heart. The cardioaccelerator center also sends additional fibers, forming the
cardiac nerves via sympathetic ganglia (the cervical ganglia plus superior thoracic ganglia T1â€”T4) to both the SA and AV
nodes, plus additional fibers to the atria and ventricles.
