Underlying medical
conditions that can contribute to edema include congestive heart failure, kidney damage and kidney disease, disorders
that affect the veins of the legs, and cirrhosis and other liver disorders.

 Therapy for edema usually focuses on elimination of the cause. Activities that can reduce the effects of the
condition include appropriate exercises to keep the blood and lymph flowing through the affected areas. Other
therapies include elevation of the affected part to assist drainage, massage and compression of the areas to move the
fluid out of the tissues, and decreased salt intake to decrease sodium and water retention.
