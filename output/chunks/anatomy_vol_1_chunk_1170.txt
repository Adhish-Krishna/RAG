Posterior abdominal muscles (anterior view)

Figure 11.16 Muscles of the Abdomen (a) The anterior abdominal muscles include the medially located rectus
femoris, which is covered by a sheet of connective tissue called the linea alba. On the flanks of the body, medial to
the rectus femoris, the abdominal wall is composed of three layers. The external oblique muscles form the outermost
layer, while the internal oblique muscles form the middle layer, and the transverses abdominus forms the innermost
layer. (b) The muscles of the lower back move the lumbar spine but also assist in femur movements.
