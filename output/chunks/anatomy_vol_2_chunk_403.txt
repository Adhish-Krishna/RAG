This area is responsible for
controlling movements of the structures of speech production. The area is named after a French surgeon and anatomist who
studied patients who could not produce speech. They did not have impairments to understanding speech, only to producing
speech sounds, suggesting a damaged or underdeveloped Brocaâ€™s area.

CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 595

Primary Motor Cortex

The primary motor cortex is located in the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe. A neurosurgeon, Walter Penfield, described
much of the basic understanding of the primary motor cortex by electrically stimulating the surface of the cerebrum.
 Penfield would probe the surface of the cortex while the patient was only under local anesthesia so that he could observe
responses to the stimulation. This led to the belief that the precentral gyrus directly stimulated muscle movement. We now
know that the primary motor cortex receives input from several areas that aid in planning movement, and its principle output
stimulates spinal cord neurons to stimulate skeletal muscle contraction.
