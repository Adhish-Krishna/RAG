Muscle fatigue, which has many contributing factors, occurs when muscle can no longer contract. An oxygen debt is created
as a result of muscle use. The three types of muscle fiber are slow oxidative (SO), fast oxidative (FO) and fast glycolytic
(FG). SO fibers use aerobic metabolism to produce low power contractions over long periods and are slow to fatigue.
 FO fibers use aerobic metabolism to produce ATP but produce higher tension contractions than SO fibers. FG fibers use
anaerobic metabolism to produce powerful, high-tension contractions but fatigue quickly.

10.6 Exercise and Muscle Performance

Hypertrophy is an increase in muscle mass due to the addition of structural proteins. The opposite of hypertrophy is atrophy,
the loss of muscle mass due to the breakdown of structural proteins. Endurance exercise causes an increase in cellular
mitochondria, myoglobin, and capillary networks in SO fibers. Endurance athletes have a high level of SO fibers relative to
the other fiber types.
