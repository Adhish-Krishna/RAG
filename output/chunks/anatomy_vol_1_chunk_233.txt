THE CHEMICAL LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION

radioactive isotope unstable, heavy isotope that gives off subatomic particles, or electromagnetic energy, as it decays;
also called radioisotopes

reactant one or more substances that enter into the reaction
ribonucleic acid (RNA) ribose-containing nucleotide that helps manifest the genetic code as protein
