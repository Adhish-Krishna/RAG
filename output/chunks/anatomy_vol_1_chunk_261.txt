As its name suggests, an integral protein is a protein that is embedded in the membrane. A channel protein
is an example of an integral protein that selectively allows particular materials, such as certain ions, to pass into or out of
the cell.

Figure 3.4 Cell Membrane The cell membrane of the cell is a phospholipid bilayer containing many different
molecular components, including proteins and cholesterol, some with carbohydrate groups attached.

 Another important group of integral proteins are cell recognition proteins, which serve to mark a cellâ€™s identity so that
it can be recognized by other cells. A receptor is a type of recognition protein that can selectively bind a specific molecule
outside the cell, and this binding induces a chemical reaction within the cell.
