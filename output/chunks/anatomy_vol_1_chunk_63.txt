The
heart is stopped and an external heart-lung pump maintains circulation to the patient’s body. The heart is cooled further
and is maintained at a temperature below 15°C (60°F) for the duration of the surgery. This very cold temperature helps
the heart muscle to tolerate its lack of blood supply during the surgery.

 Some emergency department physicians use controlled hypothermia to reduce damage to the heart in patients
who have suffered a cardiac arrest. In the emergency department, the physician induces coma and lowers the patient’s
body temperature to approximately 91 degrees. This condition, which is maintained for 24 hours, slows the patient’s
metabolic rate. Because the patient’s organs require less blood to function, the heart’s workload is reduced.

 Narrow Range of Atmospheric Pressure

Pressure is a force exerted by a substance that is in contact with another substance. Atmospheric pressure is pressure
exerted by the mixture of gases (primarily nitrogen and oxygen) in the Earth’s atmosphere.
