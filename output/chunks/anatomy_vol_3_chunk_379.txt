 24.4 | Protein Metabolism

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Describe how the body digests proteins
¢ Explain how the urea cycle prevents toxic concentrations of nitrogen
¢ Differentiate between glucogenic and ketogenic amino acids
¢ Explain how protein can be used for energy

Much of the body is made of protein, and these proteins take on a myriad of forms. They represent cell signaling receptors,
signaling molecules, structural members, enzymes, intracellular trafficking components, extracellular matrix scaffolds, ion
pumps, ion channels, oxygen and CO2 transporters (hemoglobin). That is not even the complete list! There is protein in
bones (collagen), muscles, and tendons; the hemoglobin that transports oxygen; and enzymes that catalyze all biochemical
reactions. Protein is also used for growth and repair. Amid all these necessary functions, proteins also hold the potential to
serve as a metabolic fuel source.
