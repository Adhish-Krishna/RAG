The
midline regions of the cerebellum, the vermis and flocculonodular lobe, are involved in comparing visual information,
equilibrium, and proprioceptive feedback to maintain balance and coordinate movements such as walking, or gait, through
the descending output of the red nucleus (Figure 16.15). The lateral hemispheres are primarily concerned with planning
motor functions through frontal lobe inputs that are returned through the thalamic projections back to the premotor and
motor cortices. Processing in the midline regions targets movements of the axial musculature, whereas the lateral regions
target movements of the appendicular musculature. The vermis is referred to as the spinocerebellum because it primarily
receives input from the dorsal columns and spinocerebellar pathways. The flocculonodular lobe is referred to as the
vestibulocerebellum because of the vestibular projection into that region. Finally, the lateral cerebellum is referred to as the
cerebrocerebellum, reflecting the significant input from the cerebral cortex through the cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathway.
