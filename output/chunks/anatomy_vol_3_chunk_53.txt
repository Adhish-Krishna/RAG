Figure 22.15 Boyle's Law Inagas, pressure increases as volume decreases.

 Pulmonary ventilation is dependent on three types of pressure: atmospheric, intra-alveolar, and interpleural.
 Atmospheric pressure is the amount of force that is exerted by gases in the air surrounding any given surface, such as the
body. Atmospheric pressure can be expressed in terms of the unit atmosphere, abbreviated atm, or in millimeters of mercury
(mm Hg). One atm is equal to 760 mm Hg, which is the atmospheric pressure at sea level. Typically, for respiration, other
pressure values are discussed in relation to atmospheric pressure. Therefore, negative pressure is pressure lower than the
atmospheric pressure, whereas positive pressure is pressure that it is greater than the atmospheric pressure. A pressure that
is equal to the atmospheric pressure is expressed as zero.

 Intra-alveolar pressure is the pressure of the air within the alveoli, which changes during the different phases of
breathing (Figure 22.16).
