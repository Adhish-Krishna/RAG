2 This is really a matter of opinion, but there are ethical issues to consider when a teenagerâ€™s behavior
results in legal trouble. 3 Both cells are inhibitory. The first cell inhibits the second one. Therefore, the second cell can no longer
inhibit its target. This is disinhibition of that target across two synapses. 4 By disinhibiting the subthalamic nucleus, the indirect
pathway increases excitation of the globus pallidus internal segment. That, in turn, inhibits the thalamus, which is the opposite
effect of the direct pathway that disinhibits the thalamus. 5 There are more motor neurons in the anterior horns that are responsible
for movement in the limbs. The cervical enlargement is for the arms, and the lumbar enlargement is for the legs. 6 Energy is
needed for the brain to develop and perform higher cognitive functions. That energy is not available for the muscle tissues to
develop and function. The hypothesis suggests that humans have larger brains and less muscle mass, and chimpanzees have the
smaller brains but more muscle mass.
