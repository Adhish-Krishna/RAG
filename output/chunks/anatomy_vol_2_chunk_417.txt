This depolarizes the sarcolemma, initiating muscle
contraction. Whereas other synapses result in graded potentials that must reach a threshold in the postsynaptic target,
activity at the neuromuscular junction reliably leads to muscle fiber contraction with every nerve impulse received from a
motor neuron. However, the strength of contraction and the number of fibers that contract can be affected by the frequency
of the motor neuron impulses.

 Reflexes

This chapter began by introducing reflexes as an example of the basic elements of the somatic nervous system. Simple
somatic reflexes do not include the higher centers discussed for conscious or voluntary aspects of movement. Reflexes
can be spinal or cranial, depending on the nerves and central components that are involved. The example described at
the beginning of the chapter involved heat and pain sensations from a hot stove causing withdrawal of the arm through a
connection in the spinal cord that leads to contraction of the biceps brachii.
