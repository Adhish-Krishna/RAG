tunica intima (also, tunica interna) innermost lining or tunic of a vessel

tunica media middle layer or tunic of a vessel (except capillaries)

ulnar artery formed at the bifurcation of the brachial artery; parallels the ulna; gives off smaller branches until it
reaches the carpal region where it fuses with the radial artery to form the superficial and deep palmar arches;
supplies blood to the lower arm and carpal region

ulnar vein parallels the ulna and ulnar artery; arises from the palmar venous arches and leads to the brachial vein

umbilical arteries pair of vessels that runs within the umbilical cord and carries fetal blood low in oxygen and high in
waste to the placenta for exchange with maternal blood

umbilical vein single vessel that originates in the placenta and runs within the umbilical cord, carrying oxygen- and
nutrient-rich blood to the fetal heart

vasa vasorum small blood vessels located within the walls or tunics of larger vessels that supply nourishment to and
remove wastes from the cells of the vessels

vascular shock type of shock that occurs when arterioles lose their normal muscular tone and dilate dramatically

vascular shunt continuation of the metarteriole and thoroughfare channel that allows blood to bypass the capillary
beds to flow directly from the arterial to the venous circulation

vascular tone contractile state of smooth muscle in a blood vessel

vascular tubes rudimentary blood vessels in a developing fetus

vasoconstriction constriction of the smooth muscle of a blood vessel, resulting in a decreased vascular diameter
vasodilation relaxation of the smooth muscle in the wall of a blood vessel, resulting in an increased vascular diameter
vasomotion irregular, pulsating flow of blood through capillaries and related structures

vein blood vessel that conducts blood toward the heart

venous reserve volume of blood contained within systemic veins in the integument, bone marrow, and liver that can
be returned to the heart for circulation, if needed

venule small vessel leading from the capillaries to veins

vertebral artery arises from the subclavian artery and passes through the vertebral foramen through the foramen
magnum to the brain; joins with the internal carotid artery to form the arterial circle; supplies blood to the brain and
spinal cord

vertebral vein arises from the base of the brain and the cervical region of the spinal cord; passes through the
intervertebral foramina in the cervical vertebrae; drains smaller veins from the cranium, spinal cord, and vertebrae,
and leads to the brachiocephalic vein; counterpart of the vertebral artery

visceral branches branches of the descending aorta that supply blood to the viscera

CHAPTER REVIEW

20.1 Structure and Function of Blood Vessels

Blood pumped by the heart flows through a series of vessels known as arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins
before returning to the heart.
