Gastric Secretion

The secretion of gastric juice is controlled by both nerves and hormones. Stimuli in the brain, stomach, and small intestine
activate or inhibit gastric juice production. This is why the three phases of gastric secretion are called the cephalic, gastric,
and intestinal phases (Figure 23.17). However, once gastric secretion begins, all three phases can occur simultaneously.
