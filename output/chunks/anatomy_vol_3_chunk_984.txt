A bands and light I bands repeat along myofibrils, and the alignment of myofibrils in the cell cause the entire cell to appear
striated. 37 Without ATP, the myosin heads cannot detach from the actin-binding sites. All of the “stuck” cross-bridges result
in muscle stiffness. In a live person, this can cause a condition like “writer’s cramps.” In a recently dead person, it results in
rigor mortis. 38 Eyes require fine movements and a high degree of control, which is permitted by having fewer muscle fibers
associated with a neuron. 39 The length, size and types of muscle fiber and the frequency of neural stimulation contribute to the
amount of tension produced in an individual muscle fiber. 40 Creatine phosphate is used because creatine phosphate and ADP
are converted very quickly into ATP by creatine kinase. Glycolysis cannot generate ATP as quickly as creatine phosphate. 41

CHAPTER 28 | DEVELOPMENT AND INHERITANCE 1297

Aerobic respiration is much more efficient than anaerobic glycolysis, yielding 36 ATP per molecule of glucose, as opposed to
two ATP produced by glycolysis.
