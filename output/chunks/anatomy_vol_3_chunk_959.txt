However,
the bones remain separated by the sutures, where bone and skull growth can continue until the adult size is obtained. 43 The facial
bones and base of the skull arise via the process of endochondral ossification. This process begins with the localized accumulation
of mesenchyme tissue at the sites of the future bones. The mesenchyme differentiates into hyaline cartilage, which forms a cartilage
model of the future bone. The cartilage allows for growth and enlargement of the model. It is gradually converted into bone over
time. 44 The vertebrae, ribs, and sternum all develop via the process of endochondral ossification. Mesenchyme tissue from the
sclerotome portion of the somites accumulates on either side of the notochord and produces hyaline cartilage models for each
