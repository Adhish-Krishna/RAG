7.3 The Vertebral Column

The vertebral column forms the neck and back. The vertebral column originally develops as 33 vertebrae, but is eventually
reduced to 24 vertebrae, plus the sacrum and coccyx. The vertebrae are divided into the cervical region (C1—C7 vertebrae),
the thoracic region (T1-T12 vertebrae), and the lumbar region (L1—L5 vertebrae). The sacrum arises from the fusion of
five sacral vertebrae and the coccyx from the fusion of four small coccygeal vertebrae. The vertebral column has four
curvatures, the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacrococcygeal curves. The thoracic and sacrococcygeal curves are primary
curves retained from the original fetal curvature. The cervical and lumbar curves develop after birth and thus are secondary
curves. The cervical curve develops as the infant begins to hold up the head, and the lumbar curve appears with standing
and walking.

 A typical vertebra consists of an enlarged anterior portion called the body, which provides weight-bearing support.
