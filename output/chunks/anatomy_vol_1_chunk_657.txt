The unpaired ethmoid bone is located at the midline within the central skull. It has an
upward projection, the crista galli, and a downward projection, the perpendicular plate, which forms the upper nasal
septum. The cribriform plates form both the roof of the nasal cavity and a portion of the anterior cranial fossa floor. The
lateral sides of the ethmoid bone form the lateral walls of the upper nasal cavity, part of the medial orbit wall, and give
rise to the superior and middle nasal conchae. The ethmoid bone also contains the ethmoid air cells.
