This location is important in sperm production, which occurs within the testes, and
proceeds more efficiently when the testes are kept 2 to 4Â°C below core body temperature.

 The dartos muscle makes up the subcutaneous muscle layer of the scrotum (Figure 27.3). It continues internally to
make up the scrotal septum, a wall that divides the scrotum into two compartments, each housing one testis. Descending
from the internal oblique muscle of the abdominal wall are the two cremaster muscles, which cover each testis like a
muscular net. By contracting simultaneously, the dartos and cremaster muscles can elevate the testes in cold weather (or
water), moving the testes closer to the body and decreasing the surface area of the scrotum to retain heat. Alternatively, as
the environmental temperature increases, the scrotum relaxes, moving the testes farther from the body core and increasing
scrotal surface area, which promotes heat loss.
