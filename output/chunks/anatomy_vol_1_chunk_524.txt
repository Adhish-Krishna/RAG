Dermatologist

Have you ever had a skin rash that did not respond to over-the-counter creams, or a mole that you were concerned
about? Dermatologists help patients with these types of problems and more, on a daily basis. Dermatologists are
medical doctors who specialize in diagnosing and treating skin disorders. Like all medical doctors, dermatologists
earn a medical degree and then complete several years of residency training. In addition, dermatologists may then
participate in a dermatology fellowship or complete additional, specialized training in a dermatology practice. If
practicing in the United States, dermatologists must pass the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE),
become licensed in their state of practice, and be certified by the American Board of Dermatology.

 Most dermatologists work in a medical office or private-practice setting. They diagnose skin conditions and
rashes, prescribe oral and topical medications to treat skin conditions, and may perform simple procedures, such as
mole or wart removal.
