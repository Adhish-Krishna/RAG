The axons from these neurons grow back into the CNS by following the existing axonsâ€”representing
one of the few examples of such growth in the mature nervous system. If all of the fibers are sheared when the brain moves
within the cranium, such as in a motor vehicle accident, then no axons can find their way back to the olfactory bulb to re-
establish connections. If the nerve is not completely severed, the anosmia may be temporary as new neurons can eventually
reconnect.
 Olfaction is not the pre-eminent sense, but its loss can be quite detrimental. The enjoyment of food is largely based on
our sense of smell. Anosmia means that food will not seem to have the same taste, though the gustatory sense is intact, and
food will often be described as being bland. However, the taste of food can be improved by adding ingredients (e.g., salt)
that stimulate the gustatory sense.
