Thus, hydrogen is the “water maker.”

2.2 | Chemical Bonds

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 ¢ Explain the relationship between molecules and compounds
¢ Distinguish between ions, cations, and anions
¢ Identify the key difference between ionic and covalent bonds
¢ Distinguish between nonpolar and polar covalent bonds
¢ Explain how water molecules link via hydrogen bonds

Atoms separated by a great distance cannot link; rather, they must come close enough for the electrons in their valence shells
to interact. But do atoms ever actually touch one another? Most physicists would say no, because the negatively charged
electrons in their valence shells repel one another. No force within the human body—or anywhere in the natural world—is
strong enough to overcome this electrical repulsion. So when you read about atoms linking together or colliding, bear in
mind that the atoms are not merging in a physical sense.
