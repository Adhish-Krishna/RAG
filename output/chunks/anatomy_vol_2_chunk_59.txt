Parts of a Neuron

As you learned in the first section, the main part of a neuron is the cell body, which is also known as the soma (soma =
“body”). The cell body contains the nucleus and most of the major organelles. But what makes neurons special is that they
have many extensions of their cell membranes, which are generally referred to as processes. Neurons are usually described
as having one, and only one, axon—a fiber that emerges from the cell body and projects to target cells. That single axon
can branch repeatedly to communicate with many target cells. It is the axon that propagates the nerve impulse, which is
communicated to one or more cells. The other processes of the neuron are dendrites, which receive information from other
neurons at specialized areas of contact called synapses. The dendrites are usually highly branched processes, providing
locations for other neurons to communicate with the cell body.
