Carbon Dioxide Transport in the Blood

Carbon dioxide is transported by three major mechanisms. The first mechanism of carbon dioxide transport is by blood
plasma, as some carbon dioxide molecules dissolve in the blood. The second mechanism is transport in the form of

bicarbonate (HCO3 ), which also dissolves in plasma. The third mechanism of carbon dioxide transport is similar to the
transport of oxygen by erythrocytes (Figure 22.28).

(a) CO, carried in RBC

(b) HCO, dissolved in
plasma as carbonic
acid

(c) CO, dissolved in
plasma

Figure 22.28 Carbon Dioxide Transport Carbon dioxide is transported by three different methods: (a) in
erythrocytes; (b) after forming carbonic acid (H2COz3 ), which is dissolved in plasma; (c) and in plasma.
