Figure 8.16 Femur and Patella The femur is the single bone of the thigh region. It articulates superiorly with the hip
bone at the hip joint, and inferiorly with the tibia at the knee joint. The patella only articulates with the distal end of the

femur.

 The narrowed region below the head is the neck of the femur. This is a

common area for fractures of the femur.

 The greater trochanter is the large, upward, bony projection located above the base of the neck. Multiple muscles that

act across the hip joint attach to the greater trochanter, which, because of its projection from the femur, gives additional
leverage to these muscles.
