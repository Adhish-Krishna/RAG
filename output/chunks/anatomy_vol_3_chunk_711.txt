FSH stimulates the growth of a tertiary follicle, and LH stimulates the production of estrogen
by granulosa and theca cells. Once the follicle is mature, it ruptures and releases the oocyte. Cells remaining in the
follicle then develop into the corpus luteum. (b) In this electron micrograph of a secondary follicle, the oocyte, theca
cells (thecae folliculi), and developing antrum are clearly visible. EM x 1100. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of

Hormonal Control of the Ovarian Cycle

The process of development that we have just described, from primordial follicle to early tertiary follicle, takes
approximately two months in humans. The final stages of development of a small cohort of tertiary follicles, ending with
ovulation of a secondary oocyte, occur over a course of approximately 28 days. These changes are regulated by many of the
same hormones that regulate the male reproductive system, including GnRH, LH, and FSH.
