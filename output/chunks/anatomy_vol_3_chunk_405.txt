Combine an unhealthy diet with unhealthy
environmental conditions, such as smoking, and the potential medical complications increase significantly.

 Food and Metabolism

The amount of energy that is needed or ingested per day is measured in calories. A calorie is the amount of heat it takes to
raise 1 g of water by 1 °C. On average, a person needs 1500 to 2000 calories per day to sustain (or carry out) daily activities.
 The total number of calories needed by one person is dependent on their body mass, age, height, gender, activity level,
and the amount of exercise per day. If exercise is regular part of one’s day, more calories are required. As a rule, people
underestimate the number of calories ingested and overestimate the amount they burn through exercise. This can lead to
ingestion of too many calories per day. The accumulation of an extra 3500 calories adds one pound of weight. If an excess
of 200 calories per day is ingested, one extra pound of body weight will be gained every 18 days.
