Figure 11.13 Muscles of the Anterior Neck The anterior muscles of the neck facilitate swallowing and speech. The
suprahyoid muscles originate from above the hyoid bone in the chin region. The infrahyoid muscles originate below
the hyoid bone in the lower neck.

 The suprahyoid muscles raise the hyoid bone, the floor of the mouth, and the larynx during deglutition. These include
the digastric muscle, which has anterior and posterior bellies that work to elevate the hyoid bone and larynx when one
swallows; it also depresses the mandible. The stylohyoid muscle moves the hyoid bone posteriorly, elevating the larynx,
and the mylohyoid muscle lifts it and helps press the tongue to the top of the mouth. The geniohyoid depresses the mandible
in addition to raising and pulling the hyoid bone anteriorly.

 The strap-like infrahyoid muscles generally depress the hyoid bone and control the position of the larynx. The
omohyoid muscle, which has superior and inferior bellies, depresses the hyoid bone in conjunction with the sternohyoid
and thyrohyoid muscles.
