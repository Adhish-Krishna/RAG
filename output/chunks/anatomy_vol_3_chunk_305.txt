The alimentary canal forms a
continuous tube that is open to the outside environment at both ends. The organs of the alimentary canal are the mouth,
pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. The accessory digestive structures include the teeth,
tongue, salivary glands, liver, pancreas, and gallbladder. The wall of the alimentary canal is composed of four basic tissue
layers: mucosa, submucosa, muscularis, and serosa. The enteric nervous system provides intrinsic innervation, and the
autonomic nervous system provides extrinsic innervation.

 23.2 Digestive System Processes and Regulation

The digestive system ingests and digests food, absorbs released nutrients, and excretes food components that are
indigestible. The six activities involved in this process are ingestion, motility, mechanical digestion, chemical digestion,
absorption, and defecation. These processes are regulated by neural and hormonal mechanisms.

 23.3 The Mouth, Pharynx, and Esophagus

In the mouth, the tongue and the teeth begin mechanical digestion, and saliva begins chemical digestion.
