The
facial bones include 14 bones, with six paired bones and two unpaired bones. The paired bones are the maxilla, palatine,
zygomatic, nasal, lacrimal, and inferior nasal conchae bones. The unpaired bones are the vomer and mandible bones.
 Although classified with the brain-case bones, the ethmoid bone also contributes to the nasal septum and the walls of the
nasal cavity and orbit.

 Maxillary Bone

The maxillary bone, often referred to simply as the maxilla (plural = maxillae), is one of a pair that together form the upper
jaw, much of the hard palate, the medial floor of the orbit, and the lateral base of the nose (see Figure 7.4). The curved,
inferior margin of the maxillary bone that forms the upper jaw and contains the upper teeth is the alveolar process of the
maxilla (Figure 7.14).
