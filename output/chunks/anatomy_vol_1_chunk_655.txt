In the cranial cavity, the ethmoid bone forms a small area at the midline in the floor of the anterior cranial fossa. This
region also forms the narrow roof of the underlying nasal cavity. This portion of the ethmoid bone consists of two parts, the
crista galli and cribriform plates. The crista galli (“rooster’s comb or crest”) is a small upward bony projection located at
the midline. It functions as an anterior attachment point for one of the covering layers of the brain. To either side of the crista
galli is the cribriform plate (cribrum = “sieve”), a small, flattened area with numerous small openings termed olfactory
foramina. Small nerve branches from the olfactory areas of the nasal cavity pass through these openings to enter the brain.

 The lateral portions of the ethmoid bone are located between the orbit and upper nasal cavity, and thus form the lateral
nasal cavity wall and a portion of the medial orbit wall.
