This new single cell, called a zygote, contains all of the genetic material needed to form a human—half from
the mother and half from the father.

 Transit of Sperm

Fertilization is a numbers game. During ejaculation, hundreds of millions of sperm (spermatozoa) are released into the
vagina. Almost immediately, millions of these sperm are overcome by the acidity of the vagina (approximately pH 3.8),
and millions more may be blocked from entering the uterus by thick cervical mucus. Of those that do enter, thousands
are destroyed by phagocytic uterine leukocytes. Thus, the race into the uterine tubes, which is the most typical site for
sperm to encounter the oocyte, is reduced to a few thousand contenders. Their journey—thought to be facilitated by uterine
contractions—usually takes from 30 minutes to 2 hours. If the sperm do not encounter an oocyte immediately, they can
survive in the uterine tubes for another 3-5 days.
