The arrangement of a T-tubule with the membranes of SR on either
side is called a triad (Figure 10.7). The triad surrounds the cylindrical structure called a myofibril, which contains actin
and myosin.

Figure 10.7 The T-tubule Narrow T-tubules permit the conduction of electrical impulses. The SR functions to regulate
intracellular levels of calcium. Two terminal cisternae (where enlarged SR connects to the T-tubule) and one T-tubule
comprise a triad—a “threesome” of membranes, with those of SR on two sides and the T-tubule sandwiched between
them.

 The T-tubules carry the action potential into the interior of the cell, which triggers the opening of calcium channels in

the membrane of the adjacent SR, causing Ca** to diffuse out of the SR and into the sarcoplasm.
