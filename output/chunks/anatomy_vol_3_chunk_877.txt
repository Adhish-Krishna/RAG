Mendel then proposed that
characteristics such as height were determined by heritable “factors” that were transmitted, one from each parent, and
inherited in pairs by offspring.
 In the language of genetics, Mendel’s theory applied to humans says that if an individual receives two dominant
alleles, one from each parent, the individual’s phenotype will express the dominant trait. If an individual receives two
recessive alleles, then the recessive trait will be expressed in the phenotype. Individuals who have two identical alleles
for a given gene, whether dominant or recessive, are said to be homozygous for that gene (homo- = “same”). Conversely,
an individual who has one dominant allele and one recessive allele is said to be heterozygous for that gene (hetero- =
“different” or “other”). In this case, the dominant trait will be expressed, and the individual will be phenotypically identical
to an individual who possesses two dominant alleles for the trait.
