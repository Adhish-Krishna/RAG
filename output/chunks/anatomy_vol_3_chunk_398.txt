Overall survival is dependent on the amount of fat and protein
stored in the body.

 24.6 | Energy and Heat Balance

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Describe how the body regulates temperature
¢ Explain the significance of the metabolic rate

The body tightly regulates the body temperature through a process called thermoregulation, in which the body can
maintain its temperature within certain boundaries, even when the surrounding temperature is very different. The core
temperature of the body remains steady at around 36.5-37.5 °C (or 97.7-99.5 °F). In the process of ATP production by
cells throughout the body, approximately 60 percent of the energy produced is in the form of heat used to maintain body
temperature. Thermoregulation is an example of negative feedback.

 The hypothalamus in the brain is the master switch that works as a thermostat to regulate the body’s core temperature
(Figure 24.23).
