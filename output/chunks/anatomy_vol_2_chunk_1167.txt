Although the diameter of an individual capillary is significantly smaller than the diameter
of an arteriole, there are vastly more capillaries in the body than there are other types of blood vessels. Part (c) shows that
blood pressure drops unevenly as blood travels from arteries to arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins, and encounters
greater resistance. However, the site of the most precipitous drop, and the site of greatest resistance, is the arterioles. This
explains why vasodilation and vasoconstriction of arterioles play more significant roles in regulating blood pressure than
do the vasodilation and vasoconstriction of other vessels.

 Part (d) shows that the velocity (speed) of blood flow decreases dramatically as the blood moves from arteries to
arterioles to capillaries. This slow flow rate allows more time for exchange processes to occur. As blood flows through the
veins, the rate of velocity increases, as blood is returned to the heart.
