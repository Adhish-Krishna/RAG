Peroxisomes and lysosomes are both cellular organelles bound by lipid bilayer membranes, and they both contain many enzymes.
 However, peroxisomes contain enzymes that detoxify substances by transferring hydrogen atoms and producing H202, whereas
the enzymes in lysosomes function to break down and digest various unwanted materials. 35 DNA replication is said to be
semiconservative because, after replication is complete, one of the two parent DNA strands makes up half of each new DNA
molecule. The other half is a newly synthesized strand. Therefore, half (“semi”) of each daughter DNA molecule is from the parent
molecule and half is a new molecule. 36 During cell division, one cell divides to produce two new cells. In order for all of the
cells in your body to maintain a full genome, each cell must replicate its DNA before it divides so that a full genome can be allotted
to each of its offspring cells.
