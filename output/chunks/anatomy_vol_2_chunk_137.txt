The characteristics of the various neurotransmitter systems
presented in this section are organized in Table 12.3.

 The important thing to remember about neurotransmitters, and signaling chemicals in general, is that the effect is
entirely dependent on the receptor. Neurotransmitters bind to one of two classes of receptors at the cell surface, ionotropic
or metabotropic (Figure 12.28). lonotropic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, such as the nicotinic receptor for
acetylcholine or the glycine receptor. A metabotropic receptor involves a complex of proteins that result in metabolic
changes within the cell. The receptor complex includes the transmembrane receptor protein, a G protein, and an effector
protein. The neurotransmitter, referred to as the first messenger, binds to the receptor protein on the extracellular surface of
the cell, and the intracellular side of the protein initiates activity of the G protein.
