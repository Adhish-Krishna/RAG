External respiration occurs as a function of partial pressure differences in oxygen and carbon dioxide between the
alveoli and the blood in the pulmonary capillaries.

Figure 22.22 External Respiration In external respiration, oxygen diffuses across the respiratory membrane from the
alveolus to the capillary, whereas carbon dioxide diffuses out of the capillary into the alveolus.

 Although the solubility of oxygen in blood is not high, there is a drastic difference in the partial pressure of oxygen
in the alveoli versus in the blood of the pulmonary capillaries. This difference is about 64 mm Hg: The partial pressure of
oxygen in the alveoli is about 104 mm Hg, whereas its partial pressure in the blood of the capillary is about 40 mm Hg.
