The second type
of movement is peristalsis, which, in the large intestine, is slower than in the more proximal portions of the alimentary
canal. The third type is a mass movement. These strong waves start midway through the transverse colon and quickly
force the contents toward the rectum. Mass movements usually occur three or four times per day, either while you eat or
immediately afterward. Distension in the stomach and the breakdown products of digestion in the small intestine provoke
the gastrocolic reflex, which increases motility, including mass movements, in the colon. Fiber in the diet both softens the
stool and increases the power of colonic contractions, optimizing the activities of the colon.

 Chemical Digestion

 Although the glands of the large intestine secrete mucus, they do not secrete digestive enzymes. Therefore, chemical
digestion in the large intestine occurs exclusively because of bacteria in the lumen of the colon. Through the process of
saccharolytic fermentation, bacteria break down some of the remaining carbohydrates.
