Cancer is a broad term that describes diseases caused by abnormal
cells in the body dividing uncontrollably. Most cancers are identified by the organ or tissue in which the cancer originates.
 One common form of cancer is skin cancer. The Skin Cancer Foundation reports that one in five Americans will experience
some type of skin cancer in their lifetime. The degradation of the ozone layer in the atmosphere and the resulting increase
in exposure to UV radiation has contributed to its rise. Overexposure to UV radiation damages DNA, which can lead to the
formation of cancerous lesions. Although melanin offers some protection against DNA damage from the sun, often it is not
enough. The fact that cancers can also occur on areas of the body that are normally not exposed to UV radiation suggests
that there are additional factors that can lead to cancerous lesions.

 In general, cancers result from an accumulation of DNA mutations. These mutations can result in cell populations that
do not die when they should and uncontrolled cell proliferation that leads to tumors.
