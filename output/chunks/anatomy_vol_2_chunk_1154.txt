The pulse is most readily measured at the radial artery, but can be measured at any of the
pulse points shown.

 Measurement of Blood Pressure

Blood pressure is one of the critical parameters measured on virtually every patient in every healthcare setting. The
technique used today was developed more than 100 years ago by a pioneering Russian physician, Dr. Nikolai Korotkoff.
 Turbulent blood flow through the vessels can be heard as a soft ticking while measuring blood pressure; these sounds are
known as Korotkoff sounds. The technique of measuring blood pressure requires the use of a sphygmomanometer (a
blood pressure cuff attached to a measuring device) and a stethoscope. The technique is as follows:
¢ The clinician wraps an inflatable cuff tightly around the patient’s arm at about the level of the heart.
 ¢ The clinician squeezes a rubber pump to inject air into the cuff, raising pressure around the artery and temporarily
cutting off blood flow into the patient’s arm.
