Note the environment now created in the
interstitial space: With the “back door exiting” K*, there is one Na and two Cl ions left in the interstitium surrounding
the ascending loop. Therefore, in comparison to the lumen of the loop, the interstitial space is now a negatively charged
environment. This negative charge attracts cations (Na’, K*, Ca**, and Mg**) from the lumen via a paracellular route to
the interstitial space and vasa recta.

Countercurrent Multiplier System

The structure of the loop of Henle and associated vasa recta create a countercurrent multiplier system (Figure 25.20).
