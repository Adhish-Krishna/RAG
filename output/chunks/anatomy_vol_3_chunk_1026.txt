This can be seen in the thickness
of the myocardium in the ventricles. 29 It prevents additional impulses from spreading through the heart prematurely, thereby
allowing the muscle sufficient time to contract and pump blood effectively. 30 It ensures sufficient time for the atrial muscle
to contract and pump blood into the ventricles prior to the impulse being conducted into the lower chambers. 31 Gap junctions
within the intercalated disks allow impulses to spread from one cardiac muscle cell to another, allowing sodium, potassium, and
calcium ions to flow between adjacent cells, propagating the action potential, and ensuring coordinated contractions. 32 Without
a true resting potential, there is a slow influx of sodium ions through slow channels that produces a prepotential that gradually
reaches threshold. 33 The cardiac cycle comprises a complete relaxation and contraction of both the atria and ventricles, and lasts
approximately 0.8 seconds. Beginning with all chambers in diastole, blood flows passively from the veins into the atria and past
the atrioventricular valves into the ventricles.
