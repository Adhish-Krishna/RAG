A Flowchart Showing the Thirst Response The thirst response begins when osmoreceptors detect a
decrease in water levels in the blood.

 Decreased blood volume resulting from water loss has two additional effects. First, baroreceptors, blood-pressure
receptors in the arch of the aorta and the carotid arteries in the neck, detect a decrease in blood pressure that results from
decreased blood volume. The heart is ultimately signaled to increase its rate and/or strength of contractions to compensate
for the lowered blood pressure.

 Second, the kidneys have a renin-angiotensin hormonal system that increases the production of the active form of the
hormone angiotensin II, which helps stimulate thirst, but also stimulates the release of the hormone aldosterone from the
adrenal glands. Aldosterone increases the reabsorption of sodium in the distal tubules of the nephrons in the kidneys, and
water follows this reabsorbed sodium back into the blood.
