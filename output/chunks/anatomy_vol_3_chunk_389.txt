24.5 | Metabolic States of the Body

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Describe what defines each of the three metabolic states
* Describe the processes that occur during the absorptive state of metabolism
* Describe the processes that occur during the postabsorptive state of metabolism

Â¢ Explain how the body processes glucose when the body is starved of fuel

You eat periodically throughout the day; however, your organs, especially the brain, need a continuous supply of glucose.
 How does the body meet this constant demand for energy? Your body processes the food you eat both to use immediately
and, importantly, to store as energy for later demands. If there were no method in place to store excess energy, you would
need to eat constantly in order to meet energy demands. Distinct mechanisms are in place to facilitate energy storage, and
to make stored energy available during times of fasting and starvation.
