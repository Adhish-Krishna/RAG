Exercise and Stretching

When exercising, it is important to first warm up the muscles. Stretching pulls on the muscle fibers and it also results
in an increased blood flow to the muscles being worked. Without a proper warm-up, it is possible that you may either
damage some of the muscle fibers or pull a tendon. A pulled tendon, regardless of location, results in pain, swelling,
and diminished function; if it is moderate to severe, the injury could immobilize you for an extended period.

 Recall the discussion about muscles crossing joints to create movement. Most of the joints you use during exercise
are synovial joints, which have synovial fluid in the joint space between two bones. Exercise and stretching may also
have a beneficial effect on synovial joints. Synovial fluid is a thin, but viscous film with the consistency of egg whites.
