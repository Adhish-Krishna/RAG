This test can indicate deficits in dorsal column pathway proprioception, as well as problems
with proprioceptive projections to the cerebellum through the spinocerebellar tract.

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/2point) to see a quick demonstration of two-point discrimination.
 Touching a specialized caliper to the surface of the skin will measure the distance between two points that are perceived
as distinct stimuli versus a single stimulus. The patient keeps their eyes closed while the examiner switches between
using both points of the caliper or just one. The patient then must indicate whether one or two stimuli are in contact
with the skin. Why is the distance between the caliper points closer on the fingertips as opposed to the palm of the
hand? And what do you think the distance would be on the arm, or the shoulder?

The skeletomotor system is largely based on the simple, two-cell projection from the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe to
the skeletal muscles.
