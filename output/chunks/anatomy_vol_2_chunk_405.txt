Neurons located in the primary motor cortex, named Betz cells, are large cortical neurons that synapse with
lower motor neurons in the spinal cord or the brain stem. The two descending pathways travelled by the axons of Betz
cells are the corticospinal tract and the corticobulbar tract. Both tracts are named for their origin in the cortex and their
targets—either the spinal cord or the brain stem (the term “bulbar” refers to the brain stem as the bulb, or enlargement, at
the top of the spinal cord).

 These two descending pathways are responsible for the conscious or voluntary movements of skeletal muscles. Any
motor command from the primary motor cortex is sent down the axons of the Betz cells to activate upper motor neurons in
either the cranial motor nuclei or in the ventral horn of the spinal cord.
