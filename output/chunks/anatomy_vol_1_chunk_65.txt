Mountain climbers carry oxygen to reduce the effects of both low oxygen
levels and low barometric pressure at higher altitudes (Figure 1.9).

Decompression Sickness

Decompression sickness (DCS) is a condition in which gases dissolved in the blood or in other body tissues are no
longer dissolved following a reduction in pressure on the body. This condition affects underwater divers who surface
from a deep dive too quickly, and it can affect pilots flying at high altitudes in planes with unpressurized cabins. Divers
often call this condition “the bends,” a reference to joint pain that is a symptom of DCS.

 In all cases, DCS is brought about by a reduction in barometric pressure.
