This act of swallowing,
the last voluntary act until defecation, is an example of propulsion, which refers to the movement of food through the
digestive tract. It includes both the voluntary process of swallowing and the involuntary process of peristalsis. Peristalsis
consists of sequential, alternating waves of contraction and relaxation of alimentary wall smooth muscles, which act to
propel food along (Figure 23.5). These waves also play a role in mixing food with digestive juices. Peristalsis is so powerful
that foods and liquids you swallow enter your stomach even if you are standing on your head.

Figure 23.5 Peristalsis Peristalsis moves food through the digestive tract with alternating waves of muscle
contraction and relaxation.

 Digestion includes both mechanical and chemical processes. Mechanical digestion is a purely physical process that
does not change the chemical nature of the food.
