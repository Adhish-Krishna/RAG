These
pairs of vessels will be traced through only one side of the body. Where differences occur in branching patterns or when
vessels are singular, this will be indicated. For example, you will find a pair of femoral arteries and a pair of femoral
veins, with one vessel on each side of the body. In contrast, some vessels closer to the midline of the body, such as the
aorta, are unique. Moreover, some superficial veins, such as the great saphenous vein in the femoral region, have no arterial
counterpart. Another phenomenon that can make the study of vessels challenging is that names of vessels can change with
location. Like a street that changes name as it passes through an intersection, an artery or vein can change names as it passes
an anatomical landmark. For example, the left subclavian artery becomes the axillary artery as it passes through the body
wall and into the axillary region, and then becomes the brachial artery as it flows from the axillary region into the upper arm
(or brachium).
