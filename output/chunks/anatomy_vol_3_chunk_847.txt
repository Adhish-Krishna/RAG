In fewer than 5 percent of births, the infant is oriented in the breech presentation, or buttocks down. In a complete
breech, both legs are crossed and oriented downward. In a frank breech presentation, the legs are oriented upward. Before
the 1960s, it was common for breech presentations to be delivered vaginally. Today, most breech births are accomplished
by Caesarian section.

 Vaginal birth is associated with significant stretching of the vaginal canal, the cervix, and the perineum. Until recent
decades, it was routine procedure for an obstetrician to numb the perineum and perform an episiotomy, an incision in the
posterior vaginal wall and perineum. The perineum is now more commonly allowed to tear on its own during birth. Both an
episiotomy and a perineal tear need to be sutured shortly after birth to ensure optimal healing. Although suturing the jagged
edges of a perineal tear may be more difficult than suturing an episiotomy, tears heal more quickly, are less painful, and are
associated with less damage to the muscles around the vagina and rectum.
