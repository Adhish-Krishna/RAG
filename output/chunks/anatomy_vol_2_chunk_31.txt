Many of the UM micrographs that appear in Human Anatomy and Physiology are interactive
WebScopes, which students can explore by zooming in and out.

 We also wish to thank the Open Learning Initiative at Carnegie Mellon University, with whom we shared and
exchanged resources during the development of Human Anatomy and Physiology.

12 | THE NERVOUS
SYSTEM AND NERVOUS
TISSUE

 As the neural circuitry of the nervous system has become more fully
understood and robotics more sophisticated, it is now possible to integrate technology with the body and restore
abilities following traumatic events. At some point in the future, will this type of technology lead to the ability to augment
our nervous systems? (credit: U.S. Army/Wikimedia Commons)
