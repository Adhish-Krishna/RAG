An olfactory epithelium
used to detect odors is found deeper in the nasal cavity.

 The conchae, meatuses, and paranasal sinuses are lined by respiratory epithelium composed of pseudostratified
ciliated columnar epithelium (Figure 22.5). The epithelium contains goblet cells, one of the specialized, columnar epithelia!
cells that produce mucus to trap debris. The cilia of the respiratory epithelium help remove the mucus and debris from the
nasal cavity with a constant beating motion, sweeping materials towards the throat to be swallowed. Interestingly, cold air
slows the movement of the cilia, resulting in accumulation of mucus that may in turn lead to a runny nose during cold
weather. This moist epithelium functions to warm and humidify incoming air. Capillaries located just beneath the nasa
epithelium warm the air by convection. Serous and mucus-producing cells also secrete the lysozyme enzyme and proteins
called defensins, which have antibacterial properties. Immune cells that patrol the connective tissue deep to the respiratory
epithelium provide additional protection.
