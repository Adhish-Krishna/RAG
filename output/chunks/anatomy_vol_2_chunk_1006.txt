Figure 19.16 shows the blockage of coronary arteries
highlighted by the injection of dye. Some individuals with coronary artery disease report pain radiating from the chest
called angina pectoris, but others remain asymptomatic. If untreated, coronary artery disease can lead to MI or a heart
attack.

Figure 19.16 Atherosclerotic Coronary Arteries In this coronary angiogram (X-ray), the dye makes visible two
occluded coronary arteries. Such blockages can lead to decreased blood flow (ischemia) and insufficient oxygen
(hypoxia) delivered to the cardiac tissues. If uncorrected, this can lead to cardiac muscle death (myocardial
infarction).

 The disease progresses slowly and often begins in children and can be seen as fatty “streaks” in the vessels. It
then gradually progresses throughout life. Well-documented risk factors include smoking, family history, hypertension,
obesity, diabetes, high alcohol consumption, lack of exercise, stress, and hyperlipidemia or high circulating levels
of lipids in the blood.
