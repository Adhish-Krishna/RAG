Restoring homeostasis in these patients depends upon reversing the condition that triggered the hypervolemia.

 Blood Viscosity

Viscosity is the thickness of fluids that affects their ability to flow. Clean water, for example, is less viscous than mud.
 The viscosity of blood is directly proportional to resistance and inversely proportional to flow; therefore, any condition
that causes viscosity to increase will also increase resistance and decrease flow. For example, imagine sipping milk, then
a milkshake, through the same size straw. You experience more resistance and therefore less flow from the milkshake.
 Conversely, any condition that causes viscosity to decrease (such as when the milkshake melts) will decrease resistance and
increase flow.

 Normally the viscosity of blood does not change over short periods of time. The two primary determinants of blood
viscosity are the formed elements and plasma proteins. Since the vast majority of formed elements are erythrocytes,
any condition affecting erythropoiesis, such as polycythemia or anemia, can alter viscosity.
