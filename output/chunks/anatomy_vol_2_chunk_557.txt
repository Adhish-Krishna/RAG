The exam can
be repeated on a regular basis to keep a record of how and if neurological function changes over time. In what order
were the sections of the neurological exam tested in this video, and which section seemed to be left out?

Causes of Neurological Deficits

Damage to the nervous system can be limited to individual structures or can be distributed across broad areas of the brain
and spinal cord. Localized, limited injury to the nervous system is most often the result of circulatory problems. Neurons
are very sensitive to oxygen deprivation and will start to deteriorate within 1 or 2 minutes, and permanent damage (cell
death) could result within a few hours. The loss of blood flow to part of the brain is known as a stroke, or a cerebrovascular
accident (CVA).

 There are two main types of stroke, depending on how the blood supply is compromised: ischemic and hemorrhagic.
