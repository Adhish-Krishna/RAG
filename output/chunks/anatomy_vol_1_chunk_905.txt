Rotation of the radius allows for forearm
movements.

 Hinge Joint

Ina hinge joint, the convex end of one bone articulates with the concave end of the adjoining bone (see Figure 9.10b). This
type of joint allows only for bending and straightening motions along a single axis, and thus hinge joints are functionally
classified as uniaxial joints. A good example is the elbow joint, with the articulation between the trochlea of the humerus
and the trochlear notch of the ulna. Other hinge joints of the body include the knee, ankle, and interphalangeal joints
between the phalanx bones of the fingers and toes.

 Condyloid Joint

Ata condyloid joint (ellipsoid joint), the shallow depression at the end of one bone articulates with a rounded structure from
an adjacent bone or bones (see Figure 9.10e). The knuckle (metacarpophalangeal) joints of the hand between the distal end
of a metacarpal bone and the proximal phalanx bone are condyloid joints.
