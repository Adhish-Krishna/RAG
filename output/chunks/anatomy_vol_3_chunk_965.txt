(Use the mnemonic “So Long
To Pinky, Here Comes The Thumb” to remember this sequence). The rows of the proximal and distal carpal bones articulate with
each other at the midcarpal joint. The palm of the hand contains the five metacarpal bones, which are numbered 1-5 starting on
the thumb side. The proximal ends of the metacarpal bones articulate with the distal row of the carpal bones. The distal ends of the
metacarpal bones articulate with the proximal phalanx bones of the thumb and fingers. The thumb (digit 1) has both a proximal
and distal phalanx bone. The fingers (digits 2-5) all contain proximal, middle, and distal phalanges. 37 The pelvis is formed by
the combination of the right and left hip bones, the sacrum, and the coccyx. The auricular surfaces of each hip bone articulate
with the auricular surface of the sacrum to form the sacroiliac joint.
