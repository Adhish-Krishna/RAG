Because the alveoli are connected to the atmosphere via the tubing of the airways (similar to the
two- and one-liter containers in the example above), the interpulmonary pressure of the alveoli always equalizes with the
atmospheric pressure.

Figure 22.16 Intrapulmonary and Intrapleural Pressure Relationships Alveolar pressure changes during the
different phases of the cycle. It equalizes at 760 mm Hg but does not remain at 760 mm Hg.

 Intrapleural pressure is the pressure of the air within the pleural cavity, between the visceral and parietal pleurae.
 Similar to intra-alveolar pressure, intrapleural pressure also changes during the different phases of breathing.
