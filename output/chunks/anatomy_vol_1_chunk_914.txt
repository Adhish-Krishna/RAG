Autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, or systemic lupus
erythematosus, produce arthritis because the immune system of the body attacks the body joints. In rheumatoid
arthritis, the joint capsule and synovial membrane become inflamed. As the disease progresses, the articular cartilage
is severely damaged or destroyed, resulting in joint deformation, loss of movement, and severe disability. The most
commonly involved joints are the hands, feet, and cervical spine, with corresponding joints on both sides of the body
usually affected, though not always to the same extent. Rheumatoid arthritis is also associated with lung fibrosis,
vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels), coronary heart disease, and premature mortality. With no known cure,
treatments are aimed at alleviating symptoms. Exercise, anti-inflammatory and pain medications, various specific
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, or surgery are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.
