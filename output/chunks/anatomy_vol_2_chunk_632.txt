The surface of the skin can be divided into topographic regions that relate to the location
of sensory endings in the skin based on the spinal nerve that contains those fibers. (credit: modification of work by

Other modalities of somatosensation can be tested using a few simple tools. The perception of pain can be tested
using the broken end of the cotton-tipped applicator. The perception of vibratory stimuli can be testing using an oscillating
tuning fork placed against prominent bone features such as the distal head of the ulna on the medial aspect of the elbow.
 When the tuning fork is still, the metal against the skin can be perceived as a cold stimulus. Using the cotton tip of the
applicator, or even just a fingertip, the perception of tactile movement can be assessed as the stimulus is drawn across the
skin for approximately 2-3 cm.
