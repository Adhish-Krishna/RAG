By establishing this concentration gradient,
the glucose in the blood will be able to flow from an area of high concentration (the blood) into an area of low concentration
(the tissues) to be either used or stored. Hexokinase is found in nearly every tissue in the body. Glucokinase, on the
other hand, is expressed in tissues that are active when blood glucose levels are high, such as the liver. Hexokinase has a
higher affinity for glucose than glucokinase and therefore is able to convert glucose at a faster rate than glucokinase. This is
important when levels of glucose are very low in the body, as it allows glucose to travel preferentially to those tissues that
require it more.

 In the next step of the first phase of glycolysis, the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate isomerase converts
glucose-6-phosphate into fructose-6-phosphate. Like glucose, fructose is also a six carbon-containing sugar. The enzyme
phosphofructokinase-1 then adds one more phosphate to convert fructose-6-phosphate into fructose-1-6-bisphosphate,
another six-carbon sugar, using another ATP molecule.
