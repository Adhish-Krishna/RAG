Alveolar dead space involves air found within alveoli that are unable to function, such as those affected by disease or
abnormal blood flow. Total dead space is the anatomical dead space and alveolar dead space together, and represents all of
the air in the respiratory system that is not being used in the gas exchange process.

 Respiratory Rate and Control of Ventilation

Breathing usually occurs without thought, although at times you can consciously control it, such as when you swim under
water, sing a song, or blow bubbles. The respiratory rate is the total number of breaths, or respiratory cycles, that occur
each minute. Respiratory rate can be an important indicator of disease, as the rate may increase or decrease during an illness
or in a disease condition. The respiratory rate is controlled by the respiratory center located within the medulla oblongata in
the brain, which responds primarily to changes in carbon dioxide, oxygen, and pH levels in the blood.
