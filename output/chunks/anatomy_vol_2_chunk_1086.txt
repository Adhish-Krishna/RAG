Contractility

It is virtually impossible to consider preload or ESV without including an early mention of the concept of contractility.
 Indeed, the two parameters are intimately linked. Contractility refers to the force of the contraction of the heart muscle,
which controls SV, and is the primary parameter for impacting ESV. The more forceful the contraction is, the greater the SV
and smaller the ESV are. Less forceful contractions result in smaller SVs and larger ESVs. Factors that increase contractility
are described as positive inotropic factors, and those that decrease contractility are described as negative inotropic factors
(ino- = “fiber;” -tropic = “turning toward”).

 Not surprisingly, sympathetic stimulation is a positive inotrope, whereas parasympathetic stimulation is a negative
inotrope. Sympathetic stimulation triggers the release of NE at the neuromuscular junction from the cardiac nerves and
also stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete epinephrine and NE.
