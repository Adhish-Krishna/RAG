For example, when you are anxious or scared, the amygdala will send signals to the hypothalamus along the
medial forebrain bundle that will stimulate the sympathetic fight-or-flight response. The hypothalamus will also stimulate
the release of stress hormones through its control of the endocrine system in response to amygdala input.

Figure 15.12 The Limbic Lobe Structures arranged around the edge of the cerebrum constitute the limbic lobe,
which includes the amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate gyrus, and connects to the hypothalamus.

 The Medulla

The medulla contains nuclei referred to as the cardiovascular center, which controls the smooth and cardiac muscle
of the cardiovascular system through autonomic connections. When the homeostasis of the cardiovascular system shifts,
such as when blood pressure changes, the coordination of the autonomic system can be accomplished within this region.
