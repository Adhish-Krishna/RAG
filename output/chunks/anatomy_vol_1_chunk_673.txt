 The Orbit

The orbit is the bony socket that houses the eyeball and contains the muscles that move the eyeball or open the upper eyelid.
 Each orbit is cone-shaped, with a narrow posterior region that widens toward the large anterior opening. To help protect the
eye, the bony margins of the anterior opening are thickened and somewhat constricted. The medial walls of the two orbits
are parallel to each other but each lateral wall diverges away from the midline at a 45Â° angle. This divergence provides
greater lateral peripheral vision.

 The walls of each orbit include contributions from seven skull bones (Figure 7.16). The frontal bone forms the roof
and the zygomatic bone forms the lateral wall and lateral floor. The medial floor is primarily formed by the maxilla, with a
small contribution from the palatine bone.
