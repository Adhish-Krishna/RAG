Four-chain Models of Antibody Structures

All antibody molecules have two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. (Some antibodies contain multiple
units of this four-chain structure.) The Fc region of the antibody is formed by the two heavy chains coming together,
usually linked by disulfide bonds (Figure 21.21). The Fc portion of the antibody is important in that many effector cells
of the immune system have Fc receptors. Cells having these receptors can then bind to antibody-coated pathogens, greatly
increasing the specificity of the effector cells. At the other end of the molecule are two identical antigen-binding sites.
