Ascending
tracts of nervous system fibers in these columns carry sensory information up to the brain, whereas descending tracts
carry motor commands from the brain. Looking at the spinal cord longitudinally, the columns extend along its length as
continuous bands of white matter. Between the two posterior horns of gray matter are the posterior columns. Between
the two anterior horns, and bounded by the axons of motor neurons emerging from that gray matter area, are the anterior
columns. The white matter on either side of the spinal cord, between the posterior horn and the axons of the anterior horn
neurons, are the lateral columns. The posterior columns are composed of axons of ascending tracts. The anterior and lateral
columns are composed of many different groups of axons of both ascending and descending tractsâ€”the latter carrying
motor commands down from the brain to the spinal cord to control output to the periphery.
