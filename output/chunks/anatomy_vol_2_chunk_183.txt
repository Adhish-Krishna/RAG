The eyes are just inferior to the anterior-most part of the cerebrum, but the optic nerve extends back to the
thalamus as the optic tract, with branches into a region of the hypothalamus. There is also a connection of the optic tract
to the midbrain, but the mesencephalon is adjacent to the diencephalon, so that is not difficult to imagine. The cerebellum
originates out of the metencephalon, and its largest white matter connection is to the pons, also from the metencephalon.
 There are connections between the cerebellum and both the medulla and midbrain, which are adjacent structures in the
secondary vesicle stage of development. In the adult brain, the cerebellum seems close to the cerebrum, but there is no direct
connection between them.

 Another aspect of the adult CNS structures that relates to embryonic development is the ventriclesâ€”open spaces
within the CNS where cerebrospinal fluid circulates. They are the remnant of the hollow center of the neural tube. The four
ventricles and the tubular spaces associated with them can be linked back to the hollow center of the embryonic brain (see
Table 13.1).
