Figure 12.14 Testing the Water (1) The sensory neuron has endings in the skin that sense a stimulus such as water
temperature. The strength of the signal that starts here is dependent on the strength of the stimulus. (2) The graded
potential from the sensory endings, if strong enough, will initiate an action potential at the initial segment of the axon
(which is immediately adjacent to the sensory endings in the skin). (3) The axon of the peripheral sensory neuron
enters the spinal cord and contacts another neuron in the gray matter.
