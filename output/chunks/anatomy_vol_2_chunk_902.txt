Within the body, factor
XII is typically activated when it encounters negatively charged molecules, such as inorganic polymers and phosphate

produced earlier in the series of intrinsic pathway reactions. Factor XII sets off a series of reactions that in turn activates
factor XI (antihemolytic factor C or plasma thromboplastin antecedent) then factor IX (antihemolytic factor B or plasma
thromboplasmin). In the meantime, chemicals released by the platelets increase the rate of these activation reactions. Finally,
factor VIII (antihemolytic factor A) from the platelets and endothelial cells combines with factor IX (antihemolytic factor
B or plasma thromboplasmin) to form an enzyme complex that activates factor X (Stuartâ€”Prower factor or thrombokinase),
leading to the common pathway.
