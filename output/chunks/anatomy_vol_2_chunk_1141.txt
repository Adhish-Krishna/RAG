Any blood that accumulates in a vein will increase the pressure within it, which can then be reflected back into
the smaller veins, venules, and eventually even the capillaries. Increased pressure will promote the flow of fluids out
of the capillaries and into the interstitial fluid. The presence of excess tissue fluid around the cells leads to a condition
called edema.

 Most people experience a daily accumulation of tissue fluid, especially if they spend much of their work life on
their feet (like most health professionals). However, clinical edema goes beyond normal swelling and requires medical
treatment. Edema has many potential causes, including hypertension and heart failure, severe protein deficiency, renal
failure, and many others. In order to treat edema, which is a sign rather than a discrete disorder, the underlying cause
must be diagnosed and alleviated.

Edema may be accompanied by varicose veins, especially in the superficial veins of the legs (Figure 20.8).
