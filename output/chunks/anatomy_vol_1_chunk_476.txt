The stratum basale is a single layer of cells primarily made of basal cells. A basal cell is a cuboidal-shaped stem
cell that is a precursor of the keratinocytes of the epidermis. All of the keratinocytes are produced from this single layer
of cells, which are constantly going through mitosis to produce new cells. As new cells are formed, the existing cells are
pushed superficially away from the stratum basale. Two other cell types are found dispersed among the basal cells in the
stratum basale. The first is a Merkel cell, which functions as a receptor and is responsible for stimulating sensory nerves
that the brain perceives as touch. These cells are especially abundant on the surfaces of the hands and feet. The second is
a melanocyte, a cell that produces the pigment melanin. Melanin gives hair and skin its color, and also helps protect the
living cells of the epidermis from ultraviolet (UV) radiation damage.
