Another similarity is that the
second neurons in both of these pathways are contralateral, because they project across the midline to the other side of
the brain or spinal cord. In the dorsal column system, this decussation takes place in the brain stem; in the spinothalamic
pathway, it takes place in the spinal cord at the same spinal cord level at which the information entered. The third neurons
in the two pathways are essentially the same. In both, the second neuron synapses in the thalamus, and the thalamic neuron
projects to the somatosensory cortex.

are the major ascending pathways that connect the periphery with the brain.
