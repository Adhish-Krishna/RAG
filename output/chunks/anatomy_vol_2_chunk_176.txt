This is a rare example
of nervous tissue developing as part of the CNS structures in the embryo, but becoming a peripheral structure in the fully
formed nervous system.

 The mesencephalon does not differentiate into any finer divisions. The midbrain is an established region of the brain
at the primary vesicle stage of development and remains that way. The rest of the brain develops around it and constitutes a
large percentage of the mass of the brain. Dividing the brain into forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain is useful in considering
its developmental pattern, but the midbrain is a small proportion of the entire brain, relatively speaking.

 The rhombencephalon develops into the metencephalon and myelencephalon. The metencephalon corresponds to the
adult structure known as the pons and also gives rise to the cerebellum. The cerebellum (from the Latin meaning “little
brain”) accounts for about 10 percent of the mass of the brain and is an important structure in itself.
