In everyday living, isometric contractions are active in maintaining posture and maintaining
bone and joint stability. However, holding your head in an upright position occurs not because the muscles cannot move the
head, but because the goal is to remain stationary and not produce movement. Most actions of the body are the result of a
combination of isotonic and isometric contractions working together to produce a wide range of outcomes (Figure 10.13).
