During the
sixth week, the distal end of the limb bud becomes paddle-shaped, and selective cell death separates the developing fingers
and toes. At the same time, mesenchyme within the limb bud begins to differentiate into hyaline cartilage,
or future bones. During the seventh week, the upper limbs rotate laterally and the lower limbs rotate medially, bringing the

â€˜orming models

Endochondral ossification, the process that converts the hyaline cartilage model into bone, begins in most appendicular
bones by the twelfth fetal week. This begins as a primary ossification center in the diaphysis, followed by the later
appearance of one or more secondary ossifications centers in the regions of the epiphyses. Each secondary ossification
center is separated from the primary ossification center by an epiphyseal plate. Continued growth of the epiphyseal
plate cartilage provides for bone lengthening. Disappearance of the epiphyseal plate is followed by fusion of the bony

The clavicle develops via intramembranous ossification, in which mesenchyme is converted directly into bone tissue.
