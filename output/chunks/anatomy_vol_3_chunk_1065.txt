FSH stimulates tertiary follicles to grow and granulosa and theca cells begin to produce increased amounts of estrogen.
 High estrogen concentrations stimulate the endometrial lining to rebuild, marking the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle.
 The high estrogen concentrations will eventually lead to a decrease in FSH because of negative feedback, resulting in atresia
of all but one of the developing tertiary follicles. The switch to positive feedback that occurs with elevated estrogen production
from the dominant follicle stimulates the LH surge that will trigger ovulation. The luteinization of the granulosa cells of the
collapsed follicle forms the progesterone-producing corpus luteum. Progesterone from the corpus luteum causes the endometrium
to prepare for implantation, in part by secreting nutrient-rich fluid. This marks the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. Finally,
in a non-fertile cycle, the corpus luteum will degrade and menses will occur. 28 Endometrial tissue proliferating outside of the
endometrium—for example, in the uterine tubes, on the ovaries, or within the pelvic cavity—could block the passage of sperm,
ovulated oocytes, or a zygote, thus reducing fertility.
