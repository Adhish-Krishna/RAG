Accordingly, when the heart chambers are relaxed (diastole),
blood will flow into the atria from the veins, which are higher in pressure. As blood flows into the atria, the pressure will
rise, so the blood will initially move passively from the atria into the ventricles. When the action potential triggers the
muscles in the atria to contract (atrial systole), the pressure within the atria rises further, pumping blood into the ventricles.

CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 813

During ventricular systole, pressure rises in the ventricles, pumping blood into the pulmonary trunk from the right ventricle
and into the aorta from the left ventricle. Again, as you consider this flow and relate it to the conduction pathway, the
elegance of the system should become apparent.

 Phases of the Cardiac Cycle

At the beginning of the cardiac cycle, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed (diastole).
