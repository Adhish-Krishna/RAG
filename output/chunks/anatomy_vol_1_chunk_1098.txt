These cells are located outside the sarcolemma and
are stimulated to grow and fuse with muscle cells by growth factors that are released by muscle fibers under certain forms
of stress. Satellite cells can regenerate muscle fibers to a very limited extent, but they primarily help to repair damage in
living cells. If a cell is damaged to a greater extent than can be repaired by satellite cells, the muscle fibers are replaced by
scar tissue in a process called fibrosis. Because scar tissue cannot contract, muscle that has sustained significant damage
loses strength and cannot produce the same amount of power or endurance as it could before being damaged.

 Smooth muscle tissue can regenerate from a type of stem cell called a pericyte, which is found in some small blood
vessels. Pericytes allow smooth muscle cells to regenerate and repair much more readily than skeletal and cardiac muscle
tissue. Similar to skeletal muscle tissue, cardiac muscle does not regenerate to a great extent.
