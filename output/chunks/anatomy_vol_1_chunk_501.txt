The nail body forms at the nail root,
which has a matrix of proliferating cells from the stratum basale that enables the nail to grow continuously. The lateral nail
fold overlaps the nail on the sides, helping to anchor the nail body. The nail fold that meets the proximal end of the nail body
orms the nail cuticle, also called the eponychium. The nail bed is rich in blood vessels, making it appear pink, except at
the base, where a thick layer of epithelium over the nail matrix forms a crescent-shaped region called the lunula (the “little
moon”). The area beneath the free edge of the nail, furthest from the cuticle, is called the hyponychium. It consists of a
thickened layer of stratum corneum.
