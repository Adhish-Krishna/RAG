Secondly, in both males and females, oxytocin is thought to
contribute to parent-newborn bonding, known as attachment. Oxytocin is also thought to be involved in feelings of love
and closeness, as well as in the sexual response.

 Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH)

The solute concentration of the blood, or blood osmolarity, may change in response to the consumption of certain foods
and fluids, as well as in response to disease, injury, medications, or other factors. Blood osmolarity is constantly monitored
by osmoreceptorsâ€”specialized cells within the hypothalamus that are particularly sensitive to the concentration of sodium
ions and other solutes.

 In response to high blood osmolarity, which can occur during dehydration or following a very salty meal, the
osmoreceptors signal the posterior pituitary to release antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The target cells of ADH are located
in the tubular cells of the kidneys. Its effect is to increase epithelial permeability to water, allowing increased water
reabsorption.
