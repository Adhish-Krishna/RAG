Tunica Intima

 The tunica intima (also called the tunica interna) is composed of epithelial and connective tissue layers. Lining the tunica
intima is the specialized simple squamous epithelium called the endothelium, which is continuous throughout the entire
vascular system, including the lining of the chambers of the heart. Damage to this endothelial lining and exposure of blood
to the collagenous fibers beneath is one of the primary causes of clot formation. Until recently, the endothelium was viewed
simply as the boundary between the blood in the lumen and the walls of the vessels.
