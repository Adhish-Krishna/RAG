The orthostatic reflex is a reaction to this change in body position, so that blood pressure is maintained
against the increasing effect of gravity (orthostatic means “standing up”). Heart rate increases—a reflex of the sympathetic
division of the autonomic nervous system—and this raises blood pressure.

 The internal carotid artery enters the cranium through the carotid canal in the temporal bone. A second set of vessels
that supply the CNS are the vertebral arteries, which are protected as they pass through the neck region by the transverse
foramina of the cervical vertebrae. The vertebral arteries enter the cranium through the foramen magnum of the occipital
bone. Branches off the left and right vertebral arteries merge into the anterior spinal artery supplying the anterior aspect
of the spinal cord, found along the anterior median fissure. The two vertebral arteries then merge into the basilar artery,
which gives rise to branches to the brain stem and cerebellum.
