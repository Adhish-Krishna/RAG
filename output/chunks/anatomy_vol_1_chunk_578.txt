Osteoid (unmineralized bone matrix) secreted around the capillaries results in a trabecular matrix, while osteoblasts
on the surface of the spongy bone become the periosteum (Figure 6.16c). The periosteum then creates a protective layer
of compact bone superficial to the trabecular bone. The trabecular bone crowds nearby blood vessels, which eventually
condense into red marrow (Figure 6.16d).

cells group into clusters, and ossification centers form. (b) Secreted osteoid traps osteoblasts, which then become
osteocytes.
