What is a bunion and what type of
shoe is most likely to cause this to develop?

Arches of the Foot

When the foot comes into contact with the ground during walking, running, or jumping activities, the impact of the body
weight puts a tremendous amount of pressure and force on the foot. During running, the force applied to each foot as it
contacts the ground can be up to 2.5 times your body weight. The bones, joints, ligaments, and muscles of the foot absorb
this force, thus greatly reducing the amount of shock that is passed superiorly into the lower limb and body. The arches of
the foot play an important role in this shock-absorbing ability. When weight is applied to the foot, these arches will flatten
somewhat, thus absorbing energy. When the weight is removed, the arch rebounds, giving “spring” to the step. The arches
also serve to distribute body weight side to side and to either end of the foot.
