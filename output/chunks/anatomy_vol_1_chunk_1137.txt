Â¢ Explain how understanding the muscle names helps describe shapes, location, and actions of various muscles

The Greeks and Romans conducted the first studies done on the human body in Western culture. The educated class of
subsequent societies studied Latin and Greek, and therefore the early pioneers of anatomy continued to apply Latin and
Greek terminology or roots when they named the skeletal muscles. The large number of muscles in the body and unfamiliar
words can make learning the names of the muscles in the body seem daunting, but understanding the etymology can help.
 Etymology is the study of how the root of a particular word entered a language and how the use of the word evolved over
time. Taking the time to learn the root of the words is crucial to understanding the vocabulary of anatomy and physiology.
 When you understand the names of muscles it will help you remember where the muscles are located and what they do
(Figure 11.5, Figure 11.6, and Table 11.2).
