This vessel remains to the left of the vertebral column and is embedded in adipose tissue behind the peritoneal cavity. It
formally ends at approximately the level of vertebra L4, where it bifurcates to form the common iliac arteries. Before this
division, the abdominal aorta gives rise to several important branches. A single celiac trunk (artery) emerges and divides
into the left gastric artery to supply blood to the stomach and esophagus, the splenic artery to supply blood to the spleen,
and the common hepatic artery, which in turn gives rise to the hepatic artery proper to supply blood to the liver, the
right gastric artery to supply blood to the stomach, the cystic artery to supply blood to the gall bladder, and several
branches, one to supply blood to the duodenum and another to supply blood to the pancreas.
