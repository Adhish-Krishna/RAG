If it is necessary,
further tests can establish the perceptions in the visual fields. Physical inspection of the optic disk, or where the optic nerve
emerges from the eye, can be accomplished by looking through the pupil with an ophthalmoscope.

Figure 16.7 The Snellen Chart The Snellen chart for visual acuity presents a limited number of Roman letters in lines
of decreasing size. The line with letters that subtend 5 minutes of an arc from 20 feet represents the smallest letters
that a person with normal acuity should be able to read at that distance. The different sizes of letters in the other lines
represent rough approximations of what a person of normal acuity can read at different distances.
