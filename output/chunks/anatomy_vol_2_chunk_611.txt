Purely vertical movements of the eyes are not very common. Movements are often at an angle, so some horizontal
components are necessary, adding the medial and lateral rectus muscles to the movement. The rapid movement of the eyes
used to locate and direct the fovea onto visual stimuli is called a saccade. Notice that the paths that are traced in Figure 16.9
are not strictly vertical. The movements between the nose and the mouth are closest, but still have a slant to them. Also, the
superior and inferior rectus muscles are not perfectly oriented with the line of sight. The origin for both muscles is medial
to their insertions, so elevation and depression may require the lateral rectus muscles to compensate for the slight adduction
inherent in the contraction of those muscles, requiring MLF activity as well.
