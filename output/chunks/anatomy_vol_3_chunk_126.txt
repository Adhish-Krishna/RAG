Respiratory System: Respiratory Distress Syndrome

Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) primarily occurs in infants born prematurely. Up to 50 percent of infants born
between 26 and 28 weeks and fewer than 30 percent of infants born between 30 and 31 weeks develop RDS. RDS
results from insufficient production of pulmonary surfactant, thereby preventing the lungs from properly inflating
at birth. A small amount of pulmonary surfactant is produced beginning at around 20 weeks; however, this is not
sufficient for inflation of the lungs. As a result, dyspnea occurs and gas exchange cannot be performed properly. Blood
oxygen levels are low, whereas blood carbon dioxide levels and pH are high.

 The primary cause of RDS is premature birth, which may be due to a variety of known or unknown causes.
 Other risk factors include gestational diabetes, cesarean delivery, second-born twins, and family history of RDS.
