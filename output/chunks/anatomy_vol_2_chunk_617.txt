This is followed by inspection, with the aid of a tongue depressor, of the back of the mouth, or the
opening of the oral cavity into the pharynx known as the fauces. Whereas this portion of a medical exam inspects for signs
of infection, such as in tonsillitis, it is also the means to test the functions of the cranial nerves that are associated with the
oral cavity.

 The facial and glossopharyngeal nerves convey gustatory stimulation to the brain. Testing this is as simple as
introducing salty, sour, bitter, or sweet stimuli to either side of the tongue. The patient should respond to the taste stimulus
before retracting the tongue into the mouth. Stimuli applied to specific locations on the tongue will dissolve into the saliva
and may stimulate taste buds connected to either the left or right of the nerves, masking any lateral deficits.
