The liver is divided into two primary lobes: a large right lobe and a much smaller left lobe. In the right lobe, some
anatomists also identify an inferior quadrate lobe and a posterior caudate lobe, which are defined by internal features. The

and ligamentum teres hepatis are actually remnants of the umbilical vein, and separate the right and left lobes anteriorly.
 The lesser omentum tethers the liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach.

 The porta hepatis (“gate to the liver”) is where the hepatic artery and hepatic portal vein enter the liver. These
two vessels, along with the common hepatic duct, run behind the lateral border of the lesser omentum on the way to
their destinations.
