The concept of a cell started with microscopic observations of dead cork tissue by scientist Robert Hooke in 1665.
Without realizing their function or importance, Hook coined the term “cell” based on the resemblance of the small
subdivisions in the cork to the rooms that monks inhabited, called cells. About ten years later, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek
became the first person to observe living and moving cells under a microscope. In the century that followed, the theory
that cells represented the basic unit of life would develop. These tiny fluid-filled sacs house components responsible for the
thousands of biochemical reactions necessary for an organism to grow and survive. In this chapter, you will learn about the
major components and functions of a prototypical, generalized cell and discover some of the different types of cells in the
human body.
