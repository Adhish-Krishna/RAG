A structural skin cell may be shaped like
a flat plate (squamous) and live only for a short time before it is shed and replaced. Packed tightly into rows and sheets,
the squamous skin cells provide a protective barrier for the cells and tissues that lie beneath. A nerve cell, on the other
hand, may be shaped something like a star, sending out long processes up to a meter in length and may live for the entire
lifetime of the organism. With their long winding appendages, nerve cells can communicate with one another and with other
types of body cells and send rapid signals that inform the organism about its environment and allow it to interact with that
environment. These differences illustrate one very important theme that is consistent at all organizational levels of biology:
the form of a structure is optimally suited to perform particular functions assigned to that structure.
