They have put the recommended elements of a healthy meal into
the context of a place setting of food. MyPlate categorizes food into the standard six food groups: fruits, vegetables, grains,
protein foods, dairy, and oils. The accompanying website gives clear recommendations regarding quantity and type of each
food that you should consume each day, as well as identifying which foods belong in each category. The accompanying
graphic (Figure 24.24) gives a clear visual with general recommendations for a healthy and balanced meal. The guidelines
recommend to “Make half your plate fruits and vegetables.” The other half is grains and protein, with a slightly higher
quantity of grains than protein. Dairy products are represented by a drink, but the quantity can be applied to other dairy
products as well.
