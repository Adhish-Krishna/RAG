The cerebellum can be divided into two basic regions: the midline
and the hemispheres. The midline is composed of the vermis and the flocculonodular lobe, and the hemispheres are
the lateral regions.

 Coordination and Alternating Movement

Testing for cerebellar function is the basis of the coordination exam. The subtests target appendicular musculature,
controlling the limbs, and axial musculature for posture and gait. The assessment of cerebellar function will depend on
the normal functioning of other systems addressed in previous sections of the neurological exam. Motor control from the
cerebrum, as well as sensory input from somatic, visual, and vestibular senses, are important to cerebellar function.

 The subtests that address appendicular musculature, and therefore the lateral regions of the cerebellum, begin with a
check for tremor. The patient extends their arms in front of them and holds the position. The examiner watches for the
presence of tremors that would not be present if the muscles are relaxed.
