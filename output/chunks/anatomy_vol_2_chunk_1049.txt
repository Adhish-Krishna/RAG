However, blood pressure
quickly rises above that of the atria that are now relaxed and in diastole. This increase in pressure causes blood to flow back
toward the atria, closing the tricuspid and mitral valves. Since blood is not being ejected from the ventricles at this early
stage, the volume of blood within the chamber remains constant. Consequently, this initial phase of ventricular systole is
known as isovolumic contraction, also called isovolumetric contraction (see Figure 19.27).

 In the second phase of ventricular systole, the ventricular ejection phase, the contraction of the ventricular muscle
has raised the pressure within the ventricle to the point that it is greater than the pressures in the pulmonary trunk and the
aorta. Blood is pumped from the heart, pushing open the pulmonary and aortic semilunar valves. Pressure generated by the
left ventricle will be appreciably greater than the pressure generated by the right ventricle, since the existing pressure in the
aorta will be so much higher.
