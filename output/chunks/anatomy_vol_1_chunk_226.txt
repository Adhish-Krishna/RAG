However, since there is no storage site for protein except functional tissues, using protein
or energy causes tissue breakdown, and results in body wasting.

 Nucleotides

The fourth type of organic compound important to human structure and function are the nucleotides (Figure 2.28). A
nucleotide is one of a class of organic compounds composed of three subunits:
* one or more phosphate groups.
 * a pentose sugar: either deoxyribose or ribose
* anitrogen-containing base: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, or uracil
Nucleotides can be assembled into nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) or the energy compound adenosine triphosphate.
