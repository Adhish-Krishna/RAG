The talus articulates inferiorly with the
calcaneus bone. The sustentaculum tali of the calcaneus helps to support the talus. Anterior to the talus is the navicular bone,
and anterior to this are the medial, intermediate, and lateral cuneiform bones. The cuboid bone is anterior to the calcaneus.

 The five metatarsal bones form the anterior foot. The base of these bones articulate with the cuboid or cuneiform bones.

limbs into their final positions.

 components to form a single, adult bone.

 [he metatarsal heads, at their distal ends, articulate with the proximal phalanges of the toes. The big toe (toe number 1) has
proximal and distal phalanx bones. The remaining toes have proximal, middle, and distal phalanges.

 [he bones of the appendicular skeleton arise from embryonic mesenchyme. Limb buds appear at the end of the fourth week.
 The apical ectodermal ridge, located at the end of the limb bud, stimulates growth and elongation of the limb.
