This causes the disc to become thinner, decreasing total body height somewhat, and reduces the flexibility and range of
motion of the disc, making bending more difficult.

 The gel-like nature of the nucleus pulposus also allows the intervertebral disc to change shape as one vertebra rocks
side to side or forward and back in relation to its neighbors during movements of the vertebral column. Thus, bending
forward causes compression of the anterior portion of the disc but expansion of the posterior disc. If the posterior anulus
fibrosus is weakened due to injury or increasing age, the pressure exerted on the disc when bending forward and lifting a
heavy object can cause the nucleus pulposus to protrude posteriorly through the anulus fibrosus, resulting in a herniated
disc (“ruptured” or “slipped” disc) (Figure 7.30).
