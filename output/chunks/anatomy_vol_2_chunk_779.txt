In response, the alpha cells of the pancreas secrete the hormone glucagon,
which has several effects:

* It stimulates the liver to convert its stores of glycogen back into glucose. This response is known as glycogenolysis.
 The glucose is then released into the circulation for use by body cells.

 * It stimulates the liver to take up amino acids from the blood and convert them into glucose. This response is known as
gluconeogenesis.

 * Itstimulates lipolysis, the breakdown of stored triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol. Some of the free glycerol
released into the bloodstream travels to the liver, which converts it into glucose. This is also a form of gluconeogenesis.
 Taken together, these actions increase blood glucose levels. The activity of glucagon is regulated through a negative

feedback mechanism; rising blood glucose levels inhibit further glucagon production and secretion.

Insulin release:
* Beta cells of pancreas
release insulin

Splenic artery

Insulin effects:

* Triggers body cells to take up
glucose from the blood and

utilize it in cellular respiration

¢ Inhibits glycogenolysis
— glucose is removed from the
blood and stored as glycogen

in the liver
¢ Inhibits gluconeogenesis
