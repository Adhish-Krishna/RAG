At this pace, ventilation provides sufficient oxygen to all the tissues of the body. However, there are times that the
respiratory system must alter the pace of its functions in order to accommodate the oxygen demands of the body.

 Hyperpnea

Hyperpnea is an increased depth and rate of ventilation to meet an increase in oxygen demand as might be seen in exercise
or disease, particularly diseases that target the respiratory or digestive tracts. This does not significantly alter blood oxygen
or carbon dioxide levels, but merely increases the depth and rate of ventilation to meet the demand of the cells. In contrast,
hyperventilation is an increased ventilation rate that is independent of the cellular oxygen needs and leads to abnormally
low blood carbon dioxide levels and high (alkaline) blood pH.

Interestingly, exercise does not cause hyperpnea as one might think.
