Figure 10.10 The Sliding Filament Model of Muscle Contraction When a sarcomere contracts, the Z lines move
closer together, and the | band becomes smaller. The A band stays the same width. At full contraction, the thin and
thick filaments overlap.

 Tropomyosin is a protein that winds around the chains of the actin filament and covers the myosin-binding sites
to prevent actin from binding to myosin. Tropomyosin binds to troponin to form a troponin-tropomyosin complex. The
troponin-tropomyosin complex prevents the myosin “heads” from binding to the active sites on the actin microfilaments.

 Troponin also has a binding site for Ca*~ ions.
 To initiate muscle contraction, tropomyosin has to expose the myosin-binding site on an actin filament to allow cross-

bridge formation between the actin and myosin microfilaments. The first step in the process of contraction is for Ca** to
bind to troponin so that tropomyosin can slide away from the binding sites on the actin strands.
