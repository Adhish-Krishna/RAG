The superior mesenteric artery is its main arterial supply. Veins run
parallel to the arteries and drain into the superior mesenteric vein. Nutrient-rich blood from the small intestine is then carried
to the liver via the hepatic portal vein.

 Histology

The wall of the small intestine is composed of the same four layers typically present in the alimentary system. However,
three features of the mucosa and submucosa are unique. These features, which increase the absorptive surface area of the
small intestine more than 600-fold, include circular folds, villi, and microvilli (Figure 23.19). These adaptations are most
abundant in the proximal two-thirds of the small intestine, where the majority of absorption occurs.
