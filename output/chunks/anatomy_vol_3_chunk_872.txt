Figure 28.24 Chromosomal Complement of a Male Each pair of chromosomes contains hundreds to thousands
of genes. The banding patterns are nearly identical for the two chromosomes within each pair, indicating the same
organization of genes. As is visible in this karyotype, the only exception to this is the XY sex chromosome pair in males.

Although a person can have two identical alleles for a single gene (a homozygous state), it is also possible for a person
to have two different alleles (a heterozygous state). The two alleles can interact in several different ways. The expression
of an allele can be dominant, for which the activity of this gene will mask the expression of a nondominant, or recessive,
allele.
