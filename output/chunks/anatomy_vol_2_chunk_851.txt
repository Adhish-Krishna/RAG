CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 747

Shape and Structure of Erythrocytes

As an erythrocyte matures in the red bone marrow, it extrudes its nucleus and most of its other organelles. During the
first day or two that it is in the circulation, an immature erythrocyte, known as a reticulocyte, will still typically contain
remnants of organelles. Reticulocytes should comprise approximately 1-2 percent of the erythrocyte count and provide a
rough estimate of the rate of RBC production, with abnormally low or high rates indicating deviations in the production
of these cells. These remnants, primarily of networks (reticulum) of ribosomes, are quickly shed, however, and mature,
circulating erythrocytes have few internal cellular structural components. Lacking mitochondria, for example, they rely on
anaerobic respiration. This means that they do not utilize any of the oxygen they are transporting, so they can deliver it al
to the tissues.
