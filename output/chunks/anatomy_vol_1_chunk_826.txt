The tibia is the larger, weight-bearing bone located on the medial side of the leg. The
fibula is the slender bone of the lateral side of the leg and does not bear weight.

 The proximal end of the tibia is greatly expanded. The two sides of this expansion form the medial condyle of the
tibia and the lateral condyle of the tibia. The tibia does not have epicondyles. The top surface of each condyle is smooth
and flattened. These areas articulate with the medial and lateral condyles of the femur to form the knee joint. Between
the articulating surfaces of the tibial condyles is the intercondylar eminence, an irregular, elevated area that serves as the
inferior attachment point for two supporting ligaments of the knee.

 The tibial tuberosity is an elevated area on the anterior side of the tibia, near its proximal end. It is the final site of

attachment for the muscle tendon associated with the patella. More inferiorly, the shaft of the tibia becomes triangular in
shape.
