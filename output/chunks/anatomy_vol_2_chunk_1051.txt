The semilunar
valves close to prevent backflow into the heart. Since the atrioventricular valves remain closed at this point, there is no
change in the volume of blood in the ventricle, so the early phase of ventricular diastole is called the isovolumic ventricular
relaxation phase, also called isovolumetric ventricular relaxation phase (see Figure 19.27).

 In the second phase of ventricular diastole, called late ventricular diastole, as the ventricular muscle relaxes, pressure
on the blood within the ventricles drops even further. Eventually, it drops below the pressure in the atria. When this occurs,
blood flows from the atria into the ventricles, pushing open the tricuspid and mitral valves. As pressure drops within the
ventricles, blood flows from the major veins into the relaxed atria and from there into the ventricles. Both chambers are in
diastole, the atrioventricular valves are open, and the semilunar valves remain closed (see Figure 19.27).
