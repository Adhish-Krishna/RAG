Forensic anthropology brings the tools and knowledge of physical anthropology and human
osteology (the study of the skeleton) to the task of investigating a death. A forensic anthropologist assists medical
and legal professionals in identifying human remains. The science behind forensic anthropology involves the study of
archaeological excavation; the examination of hair; an understanding of plants, insects, and footprints; the ability to
determine how much time has elapsed since the person died; the analysis of past medical history and toxicology; the
ability to determine whether there are any postmortem injuries or alterations of the skeleton; and the identification of
the decedent (deceased person) using skeletal and dental evidence.
