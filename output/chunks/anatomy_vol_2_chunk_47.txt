The first major function of the nervous system is sensation—receiving information about the environment to
gain input about what is happening outside the body (or, sometimes, within the body). The sensory functions of the nervous
system register the presence of a change from homeostasis or a particular event in the environment, known as a stimulus.
 The senses we think of most are the “big five”: taste, smell, touch, sight, and hearing. The stimuli for taste and smell are
both chemical substances (molecules, compounds, ions, etc.), touch is physical or mechanical stimuli that interact with the
skin, sight is light stimuli, and hearing is the perception of sound, which is a physical stimulus similar to some aspects of
touch.
