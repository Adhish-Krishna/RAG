The various
drugs of this class will be specific to a-adrenergic or B-adrenergic receptors, or to their receptor subtypes.

 Possibly the most familiar type of sympatholytic drug are the B-blockers. These drugs are often used to treat
cardiovascular disease because they block the B-receptors associated with vasoconstriction and cardioacceleration. By
allowing blood vessels to dilate, or keeping heart rate from increasing, these drugs can improve cardiac function in a
compromised system, such as for a person with congestive heart failure or who has previously suffered a heart attack. A
couple of common versions of B-blockers are metaprolol, which specifically blocks the B2-receptor, and propanolol, which
nonspecifically blocks B-receptors. There are other drugs that are a-blockers and can affect the sympathetic system in a
similar way.

 Other uses for sympatholytic drugs are as antianxiety medications. A common example of this is clonidine, which is an
a-blocker.
