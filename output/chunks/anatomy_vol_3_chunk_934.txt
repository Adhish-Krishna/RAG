The two processes
also differ in their location: transcription occurs in the nucleus and translation in the cytoplasm. The mechanisms by which the
two processes are performed are also completely different: transcription utilizes polymerase enzymes to build mRNA whereas
translation utilizes different kinds of RNA to build protein. 39 One or both of the new daughter cells would accidently receive
duplicate chromosomes and/or would be missing certain chromosomes. 40 A cyclin is one of the primary classes of cell cycle
control molecules, while a cyclin-dependent kinase (is one of a group of molecules that work together with cyclins to determine
progression past cell checkpoints. By interacting with many additional molecules, these triggers push the cell cycle forward unless
prevented from doing so by “stop” signals, if for some reason the cell is not ready. 41 Transcription factors bind to DNA and
either promote or inhibit the transcription of a gene. If they promote the transcription of a particular gene, then that gene will
be transcribed and the mRNA subsequently translated into protein.
