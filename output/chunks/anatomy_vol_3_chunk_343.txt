The NADH that is produced in this process will be
used later to produce ATP in the mitochondria. Importantly, by the end of this process, one glucose molecule generates two
pyruvate molecules, two high-energy ATP molecules, and two electron-carrying NADH molecules.

 The following discussions of glycolysis include the enzymes responsible for the reactions. When glucose enters a
cell, the enzyme hexokinase (or glucokinase, in the liver) rapidly adds a phosphate to convert it into glucose-6-phosphate.
 A kinase is a type of enzyme that adds a phosphate molecule to a substrate (in this case, glucose, but it can be true of
other molecules also). This conversion step requires one ATP and essentially traps the glucose in the cell, preventing it
rom passing back through the plasma membrane, thus allowing glycolysis to proceed. It also functions to maintain a
concentration gradient with higher glucose levels in the blood than in the tissues.
