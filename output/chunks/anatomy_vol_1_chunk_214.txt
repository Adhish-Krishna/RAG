Prostaglandins also sensitize nerves to pain. One class of pain-relieving medications called
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) works by reducing the effects of prostaglandins.

 Proteins

You might associate proteins with muscle tissue, but in fact, proteins are critical components of all tissues and organs.
 A protein is an organic molecule composed of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. Proteins include the keratin in the
epidermis of skin that protects underlying tissues, the collagen found in the dermis of skin, in bones, and in the meninges
that cover the brain and spinal cord. Proteins are also components of many of the bodyâ€™s functional chemicals, including
digestive enzymes in the digestive tract, antibodies, the neurotransmitters that neurons use to communicate with other cells,
and the peptide-based hormones that regulate certain body functions (for instance, growth hormone).
