It articulates with the inferior aspect of the
lateral tibial condyle, forming the proximal tibiofibular joint. The thin shaft of the fibula has the interosseous border
of the fibula, a narrow ridge running down its medial side for the attachment of the interosseous membrane that spans the
fibula and tibia. The distal end of the fibula forms the lateral malleolus, which forms the easily palpated bony bump on the
lateral side of the ankle. The deep (medial) side of the lateral malleolus articulates with the talus bone of the foot as part of
the ankle joint. The distal fibula also articulates with the fibular notch of the tibia.

 Tarsal Bones

The posterior half of the foot is formed by seven tarsal bones (Figure 8.19). The most superior bone is the talus. This has
a relatively square-shaped, upper surface that articulates with the tibia and fibula to form the ankle joint. Three areas of
articulation form the ankle joint: The superomedial surface of the talus bone articulates with the medial malleolus of the
tibia, the top of the talus articulates with the distal end of the tibia, and the lateral side of the talus articulates with the lateral
malleolus of the fibula.
