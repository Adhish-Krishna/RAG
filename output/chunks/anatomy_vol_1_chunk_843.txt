Large bones, such as the femur, will develop several secondary ossification centers, with an epiphyseal
plate associated with each secondary center. Thus, ossification of the femur begins at the end of the seventh week with the
appearance of the primary ossification center in the diaphysis, which rapidly expands to ossify the shaft of the bone prior to
birth. Secondary ossification centers develop at later times. Ossification of the distal end of the femur, to form the condyles
and epicondyles, begins shortly before birth. Secondary ossification centers also appear in the femoral head late in the first
year after birth, in the greater trochanter during the fourth year, and in the lesser trochanter between the ages of 9 and 10
years. Once these areas have ossified, their fusion to the diaphysis and the disappearance of each epiphyseal plate follow a
reversed sequence. Thus, the lesser trochanter is the first to fuse, doing so at the onset of puberty (around 11 years of age),
ollowed by the greater trochanter approximately 1 year later.
