This creates what is known as a vascular
shunt. In addition, an arteriovenous anastomosis may bypass the capillary bed and lead directly to the venous system.

 Although you might expect blood flow through a capillary bed to be smooth, in reality, it moves with an irregular,
pulsating flow. This pattern is called vasomotion and is regulated by chemical signals that are triggered in response to
changes in internal conditions, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen ion, and lactic acid levels. For example, during
strenuous exercise when oxygen levels decrease and carbon dioxide, hydrogen ion, and lactic acid levels all increase, the
capillary beds in skeletal muscle are open, as they would be in the digestive system when nutrients are present in the
digestive tract.
