After reading this section, the importance of maintaining homeostasis should
become even more apparent.

 Major Factors Increasing Heart Rate and Force of Contraction

Factor Effect

Cardioaccelerator nerves | Release of norepinephrine

Proprioreceptors Increased rates of firing during exercise
Chemoreceptors Decreased levels of O2; increased levels of H*, COz, and lactic acid
Baroreceptors Decreased rates of firing, indicating falling blood volume/pressure

Limbic system

Anticipation of physical exercise or strong emotions

Catecholamines

Increased epinephrine and norepinephrine

Thyroid hormones

Increased T3 and T4

Calcium Increased Ca**
Potassium Decreased K*
Sodium Decreased Na*

Body temperature
