Migrating motility
complexes propel the residual chyme toward the large intestine.

 The main regions of the large intestine are the cecum, the colon, and the rectum. The large intestine absorbs water and
forms feces, and is responsible for defecation. Bacterial flora break down additional carbohydrate residue, and synthesize
certain vitamins. The mucosa of the large intestinal wall is generously endowed with goblet cells, which secrete mucus that
eases the passage of feces. The entry of feces into the rectum activates the defecation reflex.

 23.6 Accessory Organs in Digestion: The Liver, Pancreas, and Gallbladder

Chemical digestion in the small intestine cannot occur without the help of the liver and pancreas. The liver produces bile and
delivers it to the common hepatic duct. Bile contains bile salts and phospholipids, which emulsify large lipid globules into
tiny lipid droplets, a necessary step in lipid digestion and absorption. The gallbladder stores and concentrates bile, releasing
it when it is needed by the small intestine.
