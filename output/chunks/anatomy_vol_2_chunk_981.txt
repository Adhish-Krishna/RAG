Left Atrium

After exchange of gases in the pulmonary capillaries, blood returns to the left atrium high in oxygen via one of the
â€˜our pulmonary veins. While the left atrium does not contain pectinate muscles, it does have an auricle that includes
these pectinate ridges. Blood flows nearly continuously from the pulmonary veins back into the atrium, which acts as the
receiving chamber, and from here through an opening into the left ventricle. Most blood flows passively into the heart while
both the atria and ventricles are relaxed, but toward the end of the ventricular relaxation period, the left atrium will contract,
pumping blood into the ventricle. This atrial contraction accounts for approximately 20 percent of ventricular filling. The
opening between the left atrium and ventricle is guarded by the mitral valve.

 Left Ventricle

Recall that, although both sides of the heart will pump the same amount of blood, the muscular layer is much thicker in the
left ventricle compared to the right (see Figure 19.8).
