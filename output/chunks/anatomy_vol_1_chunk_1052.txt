An eccentric contraction occurs as the muscle tension
diminishes and the muscle lengthens. In this case, the hand weight is lowered in a slow and controlled manner as the amount
of cross-bridges being activated by nervous system stimulation decreases. In this case, as tension is released from the biceps
brachii, the angle of the elbow joint increases. Eccentric contractions are also used for movement and balance of the body.

 An isometric contraction occurs as the muscle produces tension without changing the angle of a skeletal joint.
 Isometric contractions involve sarcomere shortening and increasing muscle tension, but do not move a load, as the force
produced cannot overcome the resistance provided by the load. For example, if one attempts to lift a hand weight that is
too heavy, there will be sarcomere activation and shortening to a point, and ever-increasing muscle tension, but no change
in the angle of the elbow joint.
