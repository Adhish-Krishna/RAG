The nature of this response was thoroughly explained in a book on the
physiology of pain, hunger, fear, and rage.

 When students learn about the sympathetic system and the fight-or-flight response, they often stop and wonder
about other responses. If you were faced with a lioness running toward you as pictured at the beginning of this chapter,
would you run or would you stand your ground? Some people would say that they would freeze and not know what to
do. So isn’t there really more to what the autonomic system does than fight, flight, rest, or digest. What about fear and
paralysis in the face of a threat?

 The common epithet of “fight or flight” is being enlarged to be “fight, flight, or fright” or even “fight, flight,
fright, or freeze.”
