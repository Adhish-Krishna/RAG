Mixing a drop of blood and saline into each well enables the blood to interact with a preparation of
type-specific antibodies, also called anti-seras. Agglutination of RBCs in a given site indicates a positive identification
of the blood antigens, in this case A and Rh antigens for blood type A*. For the purpose of transfusion, the donor’s and
recipient's blood types must match.

 ABO Transfusion Protocols

To avoid transfusion reactions, it is best to transfuse only matching blood types; that is, a type B” recipient should ideally

receive blood only from a type B* donor and so on. That said, in emergency situations, when acute hemorrhage threatens
the patient’s life, there may not be time for cross matching to identify blood type. In these cases, blood from a universal

donor—an individual with type O blood—may be transfused. Recall that type O erythrocytes do not display A or B
antigens.
