The hair bulb surrounds the hair papilla, which is
made of connective tissue and contains blood capillaries and nerve endings from the dermis (Figure 5.11).

Figure 5.11 Hair Hair follicles originate in the epidermis and have many different parts.

 Just as the basal layer of the epidermis forms the layers of epidermis that get pushed to the surface as the dead skin
on the surface sheds, the basal cells of the hair bulb divide and push cells outward in the hair root and shaft as the hair
grows. The medulla forms the central core of the hair, which is surrounded by the cortex, a layer of compressed, keratinized
cells that is covered by an outer layer of very hard, keratinized cells known as the cuticle.
