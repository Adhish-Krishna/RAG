Ischemia in turn leads to hypoxia—decreased supply of oxygen to the tissues.
 Hypoxia involving cardiac muscle or brain tissue can lead to cell death and severe impairment of brain or heart
function.

 A major risk factor for both arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis is advanced age, as the conditions tend to progress
over time. Arteriosclerosis is normally defined as the more generalized loss of compliance, “hardening of the arteries,”
whereas atherosclerosis is a more specific term for the build-up of plaque in the walls of the vessel and is a specific
type of arteriosclerosis. There is also a distinct genetic component, and pre-existing hypertension and/or diabetes also
greatly increase the risk. However, obesity, poor nutrition, lack of physical activity, and tobacco use all are major risk
factors.

 Treatment includes lifestyle changes, such as weight loss, smoking cessation, regular exercise, and adoption of
a diet low in sodium and saturated fats.
