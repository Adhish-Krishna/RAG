The HPA axis involves the stimulation of hormone release of
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary by the hypothalamus. ACTH then stimulates the adrenal cortex to
produce the hormone cortisol. This pathway will be discussed in more detail below.

 The adrenal medulla is neuroendocrine tissue composed of postganglionic sympathetic nervous system (SNS)
neurons. It is really an extension of the autonomic nervous system, which regulates homeostasis in the body. The
sympathomedullary (SAM) pathway involves the stimulation of the medulla by impulses from the hypothalamus via
neurons from the thoracic spinal cord. The medulla is stimulated to secrete the amine hormones epinephrine and
norepinephrine.

714 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

One of the major functions of the adrenal gland is to respond to stress. Stress can be either physical or psychological
or both. Physical stresses include exposing the body to injury, walking outside in cold and wet conditions without a coat on,
or malnutrition.
