Chloride ions are important in neutralizing positive ion charges in the body. If chloride is lost, the body uses
bicarbonate ions in place of the lost chloride ions. Thus, lost chloride results in an increased reabsorption of bicarbonate by
the renal system.

Acid-Base Balance: Ketoacidosis

Diabetic acidosis, or ketoacidosis, occurs most frequently in people with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. When
certain tissues in the body cannot get adequate amounts of glucose, they depend on the breakdown of fatty acids for
energy. When acetyl groups break off the fatty acid chains, the acetyl groups then non-enzymatically combine to form
ketone bodies, acetoacetic acid, beta-hydroxybutyric acid, and acetone, all of which increase the acidity of the blood.
