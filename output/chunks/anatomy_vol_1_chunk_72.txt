These pancreatic beta cells respond
to the increased level of blood glucose by releasing the hormone insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin signals skeletal
muscle fibers, fat cells (adipocytes), and liver cells to take up the excess glucose, removing it from the bloodstream. As
glucose concentration in the bloodstream drops, the decrease in concentration—the actual negative feedback—is detected
by pancreatic alpha cells, and insulin release stops. This prevents blood sugar levels from continuing to drop below the
normal range.
 Humans have a similar temperature regulation feedback system that works by promoting either heat loss or heat
gain (Figure 1.10b). When the brain’s temperature regulation center receives data from the sensors indicating that the
body’s temperature exceeds its normal range, it stimulates a cluster of brain cells referred to as the “heat-loss center.”
