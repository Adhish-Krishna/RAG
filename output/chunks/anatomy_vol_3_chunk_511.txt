These membranes have permanent aquaporin channel proteins that allow unrestricted
movement of water from the descending loop into the surrounding interstitium as osmolarity increases from about 300
mOsmol/kg to about 1200 mOsmol/kg. This increase results in reabsorption of up to 15 percent of the water entering the

nephron. Modest amounts of urea, Na’, and other ions are also recovered here.

 Most of the solutes that were filtered in the glomerulus have now been recovered along with a majority of water, about
82 percent. As the forming urine enters the ascending loop, major adjustments will be made to the concentration of solutes
to create what you perceive as urine.

 Ascending Loop

The ascending loop is made of very short thin and longer thick portions. Once again, to simplify the function, this section
only considers the thick portion. The thick portion is lined with simple cuboidal epithelium without a brush border. It is
completely impermeable to water due to the absence of aquaporin proteins, but ions, mainly Na’, are actively pumped out of
the loop by large quantities of the Na‘’K* ATPase pump.
