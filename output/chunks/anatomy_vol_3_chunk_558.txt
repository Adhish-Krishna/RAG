A thick muscular wall consisting of longitudinal and circular smooth muscle helps
move urine toward the bladder by way of peristaltic contractions.

 25.3 Gross Anatomy of the Kidney

As noted previously, the structure of the kidney is divided into two principle regions—the peripheral rim of cortex and the
central medulla. The two kidneys receive about 25 percent of cardiac output. They are protected in the retroperitoneal space
by the renal fat pad and overlying ribs and muscle. Ureters, blood vessels, lymph vessels, and nerves enter and leave at the
renal hilum. The renal arteries arise directly from the aorta, and the renal veins drain directly into the inferior vena cava.
 Kidney function is derived from the actions of about 1.3 million nephrons per kidney; these are the “functional units.” A
capillary bed, the glomerulus, filters blood and the filtrate is captured by Bowman’s capsule. A portal system is formed
when the blood flows through a second capillary bed surrounding the proximal and distal convoluted tubules and the loop
of Henle.
