When performed by untrained or overzealous individuals, CPR can result in broken ribs or a broken sternum, and
can inflict additional severe damage on the patient. It is also possible, if the hands are placed too low on the sternum, to
manually drive the xiphoid process into the liver, a consequence that may prove fatal for the patient. Proper training is
essential. This proven life-sustaining technique is so valuable that virtually all medical personnel as well as concerned
members of the public should be certified and routinely recertified in its application. CPR courses are offered at a
variety of locations, including colleges, hospitals, the American Red Cross, and some commercial companies. They
normally include practice of the compression technique on a mannequin.

 Figure 19.3 CPR Technique If the heart should stop, CPR can maintain the flow of blood until the heart resumes
beating. By applying pressure to the sternum, the blood within the heart will be squeezed out of the heart and into
the circulation.
