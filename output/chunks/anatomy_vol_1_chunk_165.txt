Again, nitrogen and hydrogen are reactants in a synthesis reaction that yields
ammonia as the product. The general equation for a synthesis reaction is A + B > AB.

a) In a synthesis reaction, two components bond to make a larger molecule. Energy is required and is stored in
the bond:

NOTE + BOOK——> NOTEBOOK

b) In a decomposition reaction, bonds between components of a larger molecule are broken, resulting in smaller
products:

BOOKWORM — > BOOK + WORM

c) In an exchange reaction, bonds are both formed and broken such that the components of the reactants are
rearranged:

NOTEBOOK + WORM ——> NOTE + BOOKWORM

Figure 2.12 The Three Fundamental Chemical Reactions The atoms and molecules involved in the three
fundamental chemical reactions can be imagined as words.

 In the second example, ammonia is catabolized into its smaller components, and the potential energy that had been
stored in its bonds is released.
