sacral region; formed from the union of the external and internal iliac veins near the inferior

Hepatic Portal System

The liver is a complex biochemical processing plant. It packages nutrients absorbed by the digestive system; produces
plasma proteins, clotting factors, and bile; and disposes of worn-out cell components and waste products. Instead of entering
the circulation directly, absorbed nutrients and certain wastes (for example, materials produced by the spleen) travel to the
liver for processing. They do so via the hepatic portal system (Figure 20.43). Portal systems begin and end in capillaries.
 In this case, the initial capillaries from the stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and spleen lead to the hepatic portal
vein and end in specialized capillaries within the liver, the hepatic sinusoids.
