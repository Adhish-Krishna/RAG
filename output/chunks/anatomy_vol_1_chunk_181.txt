A colloid is a mixture that is somewhat like a heavy solution. The solute particles consist of tiny clumps of molecules
large enough to make the liquid mixture opaque (because the particles are large enough to scatter light). Familiar examples
of colloids are milk and cream. In the thyroid glands, the thyroid hormone is stored as a thick protein mixture also called a
colloid.

 A suspension is a liquid mixture in which a heavier substance is suspended temporarily in a liquid, but over time,
settles out. This separation of particles from a suspension is called sedimentation. An example of sedimentation occurs in
the blood test that establishes sedimentation rate, or sed rate. The test measures how quickly red blood cells in a test tube
settle out of the watery portion of blood (known as plasma) over a set period of time. Rapid sedimentation of blood cells
does not normally happen in the healthy body, but aspects of certain diseases can cause blood cells to clump together, and
these heavy clumps of blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube more quickly than do normal blood cells.
