However, the reactions modern humans have in the modern
world are based on these prehistoric situations. If your boss is walking down the hallway on Friday afternoon looking for

“volunteers” to come in on the weekend, your response is the same as the prehistoric human seeing the lioness running
across the savannah: fight or flight.

 Most likely, your response to your boss—not to mention the lioness—would be flight. Run away! The autonomic
system is responsible for the physiological response to make that possible, and hopefully successful. Adrenaline starts to
flood your circulatory system. Your heart rate increases. Sweat glands become active. The bronchi of the lungs dilate to
allow more air exchange. Pupils dilate to increase visual information. Blood pressure increases in general, and blood vessels
dilate in skeletal muscles. Time to run. Similar physiological responses would occur in preparation for fighting off the threat.
