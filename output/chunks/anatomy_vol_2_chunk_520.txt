The sympathetic system is tied to anxiety to the point that the sympathetic response can be referred to as “fight,
flight, or fright.” Clonidine is used for other treatments aside from hypertension and anxiety, including pain conditions and
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

 Parasympathetic Effects

Drugs affecting parasympathetic functions can be classified into those that increase or decrease activity at postganglionic
terminals. Parasympathetic postganglionic fibers release ACh, and the receptors on the targets are muscarinic receptors.
 There are several types of muscarinic receptors, M1—M5, but the drugs are not usually specific to the specific types.
 Parasympathetic drugs can be either muscarinic agonists or antagonists, or have indirect effects on the cholinergic system.
 Drugs that enhance cholinergic effects are called parasympathomimetic drugs, whereas those that inhibit cholinergic
effects are referred to as anticholinergic drugs.

 Pilocarpine is a nonspecific muscarinic agonist commonly used to treat disorders of the eye. It reverses mydriasis, such
as is caused by phenylephrine, and can be administered after an eye exam.
