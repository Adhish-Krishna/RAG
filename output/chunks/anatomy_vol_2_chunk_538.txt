As
described in this video, the nervous system has a way to deal
with threats and stress that is separate from the conscious
control of the somatic nervous system. The system comes
from a time when threats were about survival, but in the
modern age, these responses become part of stress and
anxiety. This video describes how the autonomic system
is only part of the response to threats, or stressors. What
other organ system gets involved, and what part of the brain
coordinates the two systems for the entire response,
including epinephrine (adrenaline) and cortisol?
