The digestive processes are ingestion, propulsion, mechanical digestion, chemical
digestion, absorption, and defecation.

 Some chemical digestion occurs in the mouth. Some absorption can occur in the mouth and stomach, for example,
alcohol and aspirin.

 Regulatory Mechanisms

Neural and endocrine regulatory mechanisms work to maintain the optimal conditions in the lumen needed for digestion
and absorption. These regulatory mechanisms, which stimulate digestive activity through mechanical and chemical activity,
are controlled both extrinsically and intrinsically.

 Neural Controls

The walls of the alimentary canal contain a variety of sensors that help regulate digestive functions. These include
mechanoreceptors, chemoreceptors, and osmoreceptors, which are capable of detecting mechanical, chemical, and osmotic
stimuli, respectively. For example, these receptors can sense when the presence of food has caused the stomach to expand,
whether food particles have been sufficiently broken down, how much liquid is present, and the type of nutrients in the
food (lipids, carbohydrates, and/or proteins).
