Spinal cord nerve

(c) A central neuron projects
through the white ramus but
does not synapse in a chain ~ Dorsal root
ganglion. Instead, it continues ganglion
through one of the splanchnic
nerves to synapse within a
prevertebral ganglion.

Figure 15.3 Sympathetic Connections and Chain Ganglia The axon from a central sympathetic neuron in the
spinal cord can project to the periphery in a number of different ways. (a) The fiber can project out to the ganglion at
the same level and synapse on a ganglionic neuron. (b) A branch can project to more superior or inferior ganglion in
the chain.
