The recoil of the thoracic
wall during expiration causes compression of the lungs. Contraction and relaxation of the diaphragm and intercostals
muscles (found between the ribs) cause most of the pressure changes that result in inspiration and expiration. These muscle
movements and subsequent pressure changes cause air to either rush in or be forced out of the lungs.

 Other characteristics of the lungs influence the effort that must be expended to ventilate. Resistance is a force that
slows motion, in this case, the flow of gases. The size of the airway is the primary factor affecting resistance. A small
tubular diameter forces air through a smaller space, causing more collisions of air molecules with the walls of the airways.
 The following formula helps to describe the relationship between airway resistance and pressure changes:

F=AP/R

As noted earlier, there is surface tension within the alveoli caused by water present in the lining of the alveoli.
