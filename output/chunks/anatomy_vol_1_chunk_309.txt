Inside the nucleus lies the blueprint that dictates everything a cell will do and all of the products it will make. This
information is stored within DNA. The nucleus sends “commands” to the cell via molecular messengers that translate the
information from DNA. Each cell in your body (with the exception of germ cells) contains the complete set of your DNA.
 When a cell divides, the DNA must be duplicated so that the each new cell receives a full complement of DNA. The
following section will explore the structure of the nucleus and its contents, as well as the process of DNA replication.

 Organization of the Nucleus and Its DNA

Like most other cellular organelles, the nucleus is surrounded by a membrane called the nuclear envelope. This
membranous covering consists of two adjacent lipid bilayers with a thin fluid space in between them. Spanning these two
bilayers are nuclear pores. A nuclear pore is a tiny passageway for the passage of proteins, RNA, and solutes between the
nucleus and the cytoplasm.
