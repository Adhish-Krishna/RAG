D 32B 33 These four elements—oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen—together make up more than 95 percent of the mass
of the human body, and the body cannot make elements, so it is helpful to have them in consumables. 34 Oxygen has eight
protons. In its most abundant stable form, it has eight neutrons, too, for a mass number of 16. In contrast, 170 has nine neutrons,

and !80 has 10 neutrons. 35 Magnesium’s 12 electrons are distributed as follows: two in the first shell, eight in the second shell,
and two in its valence shell.
