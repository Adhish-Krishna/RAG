This typically prompts the heart rate to increase to about 180-200
contractions per minute, restoring cardiac output to normal levels. Vasoconstriction of the arterioles increases vascular
resistance, whereas constriction of the veins increases venous return to the heart. Both of these steps will help increase blood
pressure. Sympathetic stimulation also triggers the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine, which enhance both cardiac
output and vasoconstriction. If blood loss were less than 20 percent of total blood volume, these responses together would
usually return blood pressure to normal and redirect the remaining blood to the tissues.

 Additional endocrine involvement is necessary, however, to restore the lost blood volume. The angiotensin-renin-
aldosterone mechanism stimulates the thirst center in the hypothalamus, which increases fluid consumption to help restore

the lost blood.
