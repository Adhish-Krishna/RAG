Vertebral Column

Developmental anomalies, pathological changes, or obesity can enhance the normal vertebral column curves, resulting
in the development of abnormal or excessive curvatures (Figure 7.21). Kyphosis, also referred to as humpback or
hunchback, is an excessive posterior curvature of the thoracic region. This can develop when osteoporosis causes
weakening and erosion of the anterior portions of the upper thoracic vertebrae, resulting in their gradual collapse
(Figure 7.22). Lordosis, or swayback, is an excessive anterior curvature of the lumbar region and is most commonly
associated with obesity or late pregnancy. The accumulation of body weight in the abdominal region results an anterior
shift in the line of gravity that carries the weight of the body. This causes in an anterior tilt of the pelvis and a
pronounced enhancement of the lumbar curve.

 Scoliosis is an abnormal, lateral curvature, accompanied by twisting of the vertebral column. Compensatory
curves may also develop in other areas of the vertebral column to help maintain the head positioned over the feet.
