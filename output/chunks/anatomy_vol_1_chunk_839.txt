314 CHAPTER 8 | THE APPENDICULAR SKELETON

Initially, the limb buds consist of a core of mesenchyme covered by a layer of ectoderm. The ectoderm at the end
of the limb bud thickens to form a narrow crest called the apical ectodermal ridge. This ridge stimulates the underlying
mesenchyme to rapidly proliferate, producing the outgrowth of the developing limb. As the limb bud elongates, cells located
farther from the apical ectodermal ridge slow their rates of cell division and begin to differentiate. In this way, the limb
develops along a proximal-to-distal axis.
 During the sixth week of development, the distal ends of the upper and lower limb buds expand and flatten into a
paddle shape.
