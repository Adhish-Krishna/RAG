At the level of the
spinal cord at which the preganglionic sympathetic fiber exits the spinal cord, a branch will synapse on a neuron in the
adjacent chain ganglion. Some branches will extend up or down to a different level of the chain ganglia. Other branches
will pass through the chain ganglia and project through one of the splanchnic nerves to a collateral ganglion. Finally,
some branches may project through the splanchnic nerves to the adrenal medulla. All of these branches mean that one
preganglionic neuron can influence different regions of the sympathetic system very broadly, by acting on widely distributed
organs.

Parasympathetic Division of the Autonomic Nervous System

The parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system is named because its central neurons are located on either
side of the thoracolumbar region of the spinal cord (para- = “beside” or “near”).
