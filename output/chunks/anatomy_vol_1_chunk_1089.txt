Although they do not have striations and sarcomeres, smooth
muscle fibers do have actin and myosin contractile proteins, and thick and thin filaments. These thin filaments are anchored
by dense bodies. A dense body is analogous to the Z-discs of skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers and is fastened to the
sarcolemma. Calcium ions are supplied by the SR in the fibers and by sequestration from the extracellular fluid through
membrane indentations called calveoli.

 404 CHAPTER 10 | MUSCLE TISSUE

Because smooth muscle cells do not contain troponin, cross-bridge formation is not regulated by the troponin-
tropomyosin complex but instead by the regulatory protein calmodulin. In a smooth muscle fiber, external Ca** ions
passing through opened calcium channels in the sarcolemma, and additional Ca** released from SR, bind to calmodulin.

 The Ca**-calmodulin complex then activates an enzyme called myosin (light chain) kinase, which, in turn, activates the
myosin heads by phosphorylating them (converting ATP to ADP and Pi, with the Pj attaching to the head).
