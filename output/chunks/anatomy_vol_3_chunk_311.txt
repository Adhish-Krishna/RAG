4. Watch this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/
stomach1) that depicts the structure of the stomach and how
this structure functions in the initiation of protein digestion.
 This view of the stomach shows the characteristic rugae.
 What is the function of these rugae?

5. Watch this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/
sintestine) that depicts the structure of the small intestine,
and, in particular, the villi. Epithelial cells continue the
digestion and absorption of nutrients and transport these
nutrients to the lymphatic and circulatory systems. In the
small intestine, the products of food digestion are absorbed
by different structures in the villi.
