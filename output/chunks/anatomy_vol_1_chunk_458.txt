A typical neuron displays a distinctive morphology: a large cell body branches out into short extensions called
dendrites, which receive chemical signals from other neurons, and a long tail called an axon, which relays signals away
from the cell to other neurons, muscles, or glands. Many axons are wrapped by a myelin sheath, a lipid derivative that acts
as an insulator and speeds up the transmission of the action potential. Other cells in the nervous tissue, the neuroglia, include
the astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and Schwann cells.

4.6 Tissue Injury and Aging

Inflammation is the classic response of the body to injury and follows a common sequence of events. The area is red,
feels warm to the touch, swells, and is painful. Injured cells, mast cells, and resident macrophages release chemical signals
that cause vasodilation and fluid leakage in the surrounding tissue. The repair phase includes blood clotting, followed
by regeneration of tissue as fibroblasts deposit collagen.
