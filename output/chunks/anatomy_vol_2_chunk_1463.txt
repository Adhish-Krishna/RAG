The worst cases of over-
reactive immune responses are autoimmune diseases, where an individualâ€™s immune system attacks his or her own body
because of the breakdown of immunological tolerance. These diseases are more common in the aged, so treating them will
be a challenge in the future as the aged population in the world increases.

21.7 Transplantation and Cancer Immunology

Blood transfusion and organ transplantation both require an understanding of the immune response to prevent medical
complications. Blood needs to be typed so that natural antibodies against mismatched blood will not destroy it, causing
more harm than good to the recipient. Transplanted organs must be matched by their MHC molecules and, with the use of
immunosuppressive drugs, can be successful even if an exact tissue match cannot be made. Another aspect to the immune
response is its ability to control and eradicate cancer. Although this has been shown to occur with some rare cancers and
