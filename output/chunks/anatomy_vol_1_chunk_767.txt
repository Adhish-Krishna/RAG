There are some sex differences in the morphology of the clavicle. In women, the clavicle tends to be
shorter, thinner, and less curved. In men, the clavicle is heavier and longer, and has a greater curvature and rougher surfaces
where muscles attach, features that are more pronounced in manual workers.

 The clavicle is the most commonly fractured bone in the body. Such breaks often occur because of the force exerted
on the clavicle when a person falls onto his or her outstretched arms, or when the lateral shoulder receives a strong blow.
 Because the sternoclavicular joint is strong and rarely dislocated, excessive force results in the breaking of the clavicle,
usually between the middle and lateral portions of the bone. If the fracture is complete, the shoulder and lateral clavicle
fragment will drop due to the weight of the upper limb, causing the person to support the sagging limb with their other
hand.
