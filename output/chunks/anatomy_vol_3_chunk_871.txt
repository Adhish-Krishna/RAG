An individual’s complete genetic
makeup is referred to as his or her genotype. The characteristics that the genes express, whether they are physical,
behavioral, or biochemical, are a person’s phenotype.

 You inherit one chromosome in each pair—a full complement of 23—from each parent. This occurs when the sperm
and oocyte combine at the moment of your conception. Homologous chromosomes—those that make up a complementary
pair—have genes for the same characteristics in the same location on the chromosome. Because one copy of a gene, an
allele, is inherited from each parent, the alleles in these complementary pairs may vary. Take for example an allele that
encodes for dimples. A child may inherit the allele encoding for dimples on the chromosome from the father and the allele
that encodes for smooth skin (no dimples) on the chromosome from the mother.
