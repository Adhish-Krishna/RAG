2.5 Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning

Organic compounds essential to human functioning include carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleotides. These
compounds are said to be organic because they contain both carbon and hydrogen. Carbon atoms in organic compounds
readily share electrons with hydrogen and other atoms, usually oxygen, and sometimes nitrogen. Carbon atoms also may
bond with one or more functional groups such as carboxyls, hydroxyls, aminos, or phosphates. Monomers are single units
of organic compounds. They bond by dehydration synthesis to form polymers, which can in turn be broken by hydrolysis.
 Carbohydrate compounds provide essential body fuel. Their structural forms include monosaccharides such as glucose,
disaccharides such as lactose, and polysaccharides, including starches (polymers of glucose), glycogen (the storage form of
glucose), and fiber. All body cells can use glucose for fuel. It is converted via an oxidation-reduction reaction to ATP.
 Lipids are hydrophobic compounds that provide body fuel and are important components of many biological
compounds.
