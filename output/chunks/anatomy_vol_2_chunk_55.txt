Maybe you have seen an advertisement
on a website saying that there is a secret to unlocking the full potential of your mind—as if there were 90 percent of
your brain sitting idle, just waiting for you to use it. If you see an ad like that, don’t click. It isn’t true.

 An easy way to see how much of the brain a person uses is to take measurements of brain activity while
performing a task. An example of this kind of measurement is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which
generates a map of the most active areas and can be generated and presented in three dimensions (Figure 12.7). This
procedure is different from the standard MRI technique because it is measuring changes in the tissue in time with an
experimental condition or event.

The underlying assumption is that active nervous tissue will have greater blood flow.
