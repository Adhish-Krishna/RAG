(The process of myelination is not completed until adolescence.) During this period, the fetus grows
eyelashes. The eyelids are no longer fused and can be opened and closed. The lungs begin producing surfactant, a substance
that reduces surface tension in the lungs and assists proper lung expansion after birth. Inadequate surfactant production
