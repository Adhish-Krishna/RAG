452 CHAPTER 11| THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM

The muscles of the anterior compartment of the thigh flex the thigh and extend the leg. This compartment contains
the quadriceps femoris group, which actually comprises four muscles that extend and stabilize the knee. The rectus
femoris is on the anterior aspect of the thigh, the vastus lateralis is on the lateral aspect of the thigh, the vastus medialis is
on the medial aspect of the thigh, and the vastus intermedius is between the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis and deep
to the rectus femoris.
