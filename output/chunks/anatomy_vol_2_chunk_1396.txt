Scientists now know the cause of the agglutination is an antibody molecule, also called an immunoglobulin. What
is an antibody? An antibody protein is essentially a secreted form of a B cell receptor. (In fact, surface immunoglobulin is
another name for the B cell receptor.) Not surprisingly, the same genes encode both the secreted antibodies and the surface
immunoglobulins. One minor difference in the way these proteins are synthesized distinguishes a naive B cell with antibody
on its surface from an antibody-secreting plasma cell with no antibodies on its surface. The antibodies of the plasma cell
have the exact same antigen-binding site and specificity as their B cell precursors.

 There are five different classes of antibody found in humans: IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE. Each of these has specific
functions in the immune response, so by learning about them, researchers can learn about the great variety of antibody
functions critical to many adaptive immune responses.

B cells do not recognize antigen in the complex fashion of T cells.
