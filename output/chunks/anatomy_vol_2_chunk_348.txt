. The choroid is a layer
s posterior to the ciliary

body, a muscular structure that is attached to the lens by zonule fibers. These two structures bend the lens, allowing it to

focus light on the back of the eye. Overlaying the ciliary body, and visible in the anterior eye, is the
the eye. The iris is a smooth muscle that opens or closes the pupil, which is the hole at the center o

irisâ€”the colored part of
the eye that allows light

to enter. The iris constricts the pupil in response to bright light and dilates the pupil in response to dim light. The innermost
layer of the eye is the neural tunic, or retina, which contains the nervous tissue responsible for photoreception.

between the cornea and lens, including the iris and ciliary body.
