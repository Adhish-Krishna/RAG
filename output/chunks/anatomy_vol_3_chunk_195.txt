Saliva also contains epidermal growth factor, which might have given rise to the adage “a mother’s kiss can
heal a wound.”

1034 CHAPTER 23 | THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM

 Each of the major salivary glands secretes a unique formulation of saliva according to its cellular makeup. For example,
the parotid glands secrete a watery solution that contains salivary amylase. The submandibular glands have cells similar to
those of the parotid glands, as well as mucus-secreting cells. Therefore, saliva secreted by the submandibular glands also
contains amylase but in a liquid thickened with mucus. The sublingual glands contain mostly mucous cells, and they secrete
the thickest saliva with the least amount of salivary amylase.
