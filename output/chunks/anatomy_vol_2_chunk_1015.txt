When two independently beating embryonic cardiac muscle cells are placed together,
the cell with the higher inherent rate sets the pace, and the impulse spreads from the faster to the slower cell to trigger a
contraction. As more cells are joined together, the fastest cell continues to assume control of the rate. A fully developed adult
heart maintains the capability of generating its own electrical impulse, triggered by the fastest cells, as part of the cardiac
conduction system. The components of the cardiac conduction system include the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node,
the atrioventricular bundle, the atrioventricular bundle branches, and the Purkinje cells (Figure 19.18).
