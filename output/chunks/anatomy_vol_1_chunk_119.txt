In fact, chemicals
called nucleotide bases are the foundation of the genetic code with the instructions on how to build and maintain the human
body from conception through old age. There are about three billion of these base pairs in human DNA.

 Human chemistry includes organic molecules (carbon-based) and biochemicals (those produced by the body). Human
chemistry also includes elements. In fact, life cannot exist without many of the elements that are part of the earth. All of
the elements that contribute to chemical reactions, to the transformation of energy, and to electrical activity and muscle
contraction—elements that include phosphorus, carbon, sodium, and calcium, to name a few—originated in stars.

 These elements, in turn, can form both the inorganic and organic chemical compounds important to life, including,
for example, water, glucose, and proteins.
