(b) In this micrograph of the osteon, you can clearly see the concentric lamellae and central canals.

The microscopic structural unit of compact bone is called an osteon, or Haversian system. Each osteon is composed
of concentric rings of calcified matrix called lamellae (singular = lamella). Running down the center of each osteon is the
central canal, or Haversian canal, which contains blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatic vessels. These vessels and nerves
branch off at right angles through a perforating canal, also known as Volkmann’s canals, to extend to the periosteum and
endosteum.

 The osteocytes are located inside spaces called lacunae (singular = lacuna), found at the borders of adjacent lamellae.
 As described earlier, canaliculi connect with the canaliculi of other lacunae and eventually with the central canal. This
system allows nutrients to be transported to the osteocytes and wastes to be removed from them.

Spongy (Cancellous) Bone

Like compact bone, spongy bone, also known as cancellous bone, contains osteocytes housed in lacunae, but they are not
arranged in concentric circles.
