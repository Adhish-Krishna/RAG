Or is it at the base of the hand? Is it on the palm-
side or back-side? By using precise anatomical terminology, we eliminate ambiguity. Anatomical terms derive from ancient
Greek and Latin words. Because these languages are no longer used in everyday conversation, the meaning of their words
does not change.

 Anatomical terms are made up of roots, prefixes, and suffixes. The root of a term often refers to an organ, tissue, or
condition, whereas the prefix or suffix often describes the root. For example, in the disorder hypertension, the prefix “hyper-
” means “high” or “over,” and the root word “tension” refers to pressure, so the word “hypertension” refers to abnormally
high blood pressure.
