In addition, continued digestion requires an upward adjustment of the low pH of stomach chyme, along
with rigorous mixing of the chyme with bile and pancreatic juices. Both processes take time, so the pumping action of the
pylorus must be carefully controlled to prevent the duodenum from being overwhelmed with chyme.

Small Intestine: Lactose Intolerance

Lactose intolerance is a condition characterized by indigestion caused by dairy products. It occurs when the absorptive
cells of the small intestine do not produce enough lactase, the enzyme that digests the milk sugar lactose. In most
mammals, lactose intolerance increases with age. In contrast, some human populations, most notably Caucasians, are
able to maintain the ability to produce lactase as adults.

 In people with lactose intolerance, the lactose in chyme is not digested. Bacteria in the large intestine ferment the
undigested lactose, a process that produces gas.
