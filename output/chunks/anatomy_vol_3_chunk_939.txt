39 Under the light
microscope, cells appear striated due to the arrangement of the contractile proteins actin and myosin. 40 Neurons are well suited
for the transmission of nerve impulses because short extensions, dendrites, receive impulses from other neurons, while a long
tail extension, an axon, carries electrical impulses away from the cell to other neurons. 41 Astrocytes regulate ions and uptake
and/or breakdown of some neurotransmitters and contribute to the formation of the blood-brain-barrier. 42 These symptoms
would indicate that infection is present. 43 Since NSAIDs or other anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit the formation of blood clots,
regular and prolonged use of these drugs may promote internal bleeding, such as bleeding in the stomach. Excessive levels of
cortisol would suppress inflammation, which could slow the wound healing process. 44 The genetic makeup and the lifestyle
of each individual are factors which determine the degree of decline in cells, tissues, and organs as an individual ages.
