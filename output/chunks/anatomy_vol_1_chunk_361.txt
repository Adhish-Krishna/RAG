It is composed of a phospholipid bilayer, with hydrophobic internal lipid “tails” and hydrophilic external phosphate “heads.”
Various membrane proteins are scattered throughout the bilayer, both inserted within it and attached to it peripherally. The
cell membrane is selectively permeable, allowing only a limited number of materials to diffuse through its lipid bilayer.
 All materials that cross the membrane do so using passive (non energy-requiring) or active (energy-requiring) transport
processes. During passive transport, materials move by simple diffusion or by facilitated diffusion through the membrane,
down their concentration gradient. Water passes through the membrane in a diffusion process called osmosis. During active
transport, energy is expended to assist material movement across the membrane in a direction against their concentration
gradient. Active transport may take place with the help of protein pumps or through the use of vesicles.

 3.2 The Cytoplasm and Cellular Organelles

The internal environmental of a living cell is made u
of water, but also contains various dissolved nutrients

p of a fluid, jelly-like substance called cytosol, which consists mainly
and other molecules.
