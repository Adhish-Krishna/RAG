Although periodic accumulation of excess fat may have provided an evolutionary advantage to our ancestors, who
experienced unpredictable bouts of famine, it is now becoming chronic and considered a major health threat. Recent
studies indicate that a distressing percentage of our population is overweight and/or clinically obese. Not only is this
a problem for the individuals affected, but it also has a severe impact on our healthcare system. Changes in lifestyle,
specifically in diet and exercise, are the best ways to control body fat accumulation, especially when it reaches levels
that increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes.

 Pigmentation

The color of skin is influenced by a number of pigments, including melanin, carotene, and hemoglobin. Recall that melanin
is produced by cells called melanocytes, which are found scattered throughout the stratum basale of the epidermis. The
melanin is transferred into the keratinocytes via a cellular vesicle called a melanosome (Figure 5.8).
