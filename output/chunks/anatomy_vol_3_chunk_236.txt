The jejunum is about 0.9 meters (3 feet) long (in life) and runs from the duodenum to the ileum. Jejunum means
“empty” in Latin and supposedly was so named by the ancient Greeks who noticed it was always empty at death. No clear
demarcation exists between the jejunum and the final segment of the small intestine, the ileum.

 The ileum is the longest part of the small intestine, measuring about 1.8 meters (6 feet) in length. It is thicker, more
vascular, and has more developed mucosal folds than the jejunum. The ileum joins the cecum, the first portion of the large
intestine, at the ileocecal sphincter (or valve). The jejunum and ileum are tethered to the posterior abdominal wall by the
mesentery. The large intestine frames these three parts of the small intestine.

 Parasympathetic nerve fibers from the vagus nerve and sympathetic nerve fibers from the thoracic splanchnic nerve
provide extrinsic innervation to the small intestine.
