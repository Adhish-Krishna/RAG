Stem cells may be viewed as occupying a hierarchal system, with some loss of the
ability to diversify at each step. The totipotent stem cell is the zygote, or fertilized egg. The totipotent (toti- = “all”) stem
cell gives rise to all cells of the human body. The next level is the pluripotent stem cell, which gives rise to multiple types
of cells of the body and some of the supporting fetal membranes. Beneath this level, the mesenchymal cell is a stem cell
that develops only into types of connective tissue, including fibrous connective tissue, bone, cartilage, and blood, but not
epithelium, muscle, and nervous tissue. One step lower on the hierarchy of stem cells is the hemopoietic stem cell, or
hemocytoblast. All of the formed elements of blood originate from this specific type of cell.
