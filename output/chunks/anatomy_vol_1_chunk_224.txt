(d) Products are released and the enzyme returns to its original form, ready to facilitate
another enzymatic reaction.

(a) (b) (c)

 Binding of a substrate produces an enzyme-substrate complex. It is likely that enzymes speed up chemical reactions in
part because the enzyme-â€”substrate complex undergoes a set of temporary and reversible changes that cause the substrates to
be oriented toward each other in an optimal position to facilitate their interaction. This promotes increased reaction speed.
 The enzyme then releases the product(s), and resumes its original shape. The enzyme is then free to engage in the process
again, and will do so as long as substrate remains.

 Other Functions of Proteins

Advertisements for protein bars, powders, and shakes all say that protein is important in building, repairing, and maintaining
muscle tissue, but the truth is that proteins contribute to all body tissues, from the skin to the brain cells.
