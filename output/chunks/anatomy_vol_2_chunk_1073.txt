Heart: Broken Heart Syndrome

Extreme stress from such life events as the death of a loved one, an emotional break up, loss of income, or foreclosure
of a home may lead to a condition commonly referred to as broken heart syndrome. This condition may also be called
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, transient apical ballooning syndrome, apical ballooning cardiomyopathy, stress-induced
cardiomyopathy, Gebrochenes-Herz syndrome, and stress cardiomyopathy. The recognized effects on the heart include
congestive heart failure due to a profound weakening of the myocardium not related to lack of oxygen. This may lead
to acute heart failure, lethal arrhythmias, or even the rupture of a ventricle. The exact etiology is not known, but several
factors have been suggested, including transient vasospasm, dysfunction of the cardiac capillaries, or thickening of the
myocardium—particularly in the left ventricle—that may lead to the critical circulation of blood to this region.
