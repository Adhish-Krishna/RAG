SV can also increase from 70 to approximately
130 mL due to increased strength of contraction. This would increase CO to approximately 19.5 L/min, 4-5 times the resting
rate. Top cardiovascular athletes can achieve even higher levels. At their peak performance, they may increase resting CO
by 7-8 times.

 Since the heart is a muscle, exercising it increases its efficiency. The difference between maximum and resting CO is
known as the cardiac reserve. It measures the residual capacity of the heart to pump blood.

 Heart Rates

HRs vary considerably, not only with exercise and fitness levels, but also with age. Newborn resting HRs may be 120 bpm.
 HR gradually decreases until young adulthood and then gradually increases again with age.

 Maximum HRs are normally in the range of 200-220 bpm, although there are some extreme cases in which they may
reach higher levels.
