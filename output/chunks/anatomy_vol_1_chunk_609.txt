The normal
level of calcium in the blood is about 10 mg/dL. When the body cannot maintain this level, a person will experience hypo-
or hypercalcemia.

 Hypocalcemia, a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of calcium, can have an adverse effect on a number
of different body systems including circulation, muscles, nerves, and bone. Without adequate calcium, blood has difficulty
coagulating, the heart may skip beats or stop beating altogether, muscles may have difficulty contracting, nerves may have
difficulty functioning, and bones may become brittle. The causes of hypocalcemia can range from hormonal imbalances to
an improper diet. Treatments vary according to the cause, but prognoses are generally good.

 Conversely, in hypercalcemia, a condition characterized by abnormally high levels of calcium, the nervous system is
underactive, which results in lethargy, sluggish reflexes, constipation and loss of appetite, confusion, and in severe cases,
coma.
