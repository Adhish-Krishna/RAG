As a result, hyperpnea related to exercise is initiated when exercise
begins, as opposed to when tissue oxygen demand actually increases.

 In contrast, acute exposure to a high altitude, particularly during times of physical exertion, does result in low blood
and tissue levels of oxygen. This change is caused by a low partial pressure of oxygen in the air, because the atmospheric
pressure at high altitudes is lower than the atmospheric pressure at sea level. This can lead to a condition called acute
mountain sickness (AMS) with symptoms that include headaches, disorientation, fatigue, nausea, and lightheadedness.
 Over a long period of time, a personâ€™s body will adjust to the high altitude, a process called acclimatization. During
acclimatization, the low tissue levels of oxygen will cause the kidneys to produce greater amounts of the hormone
erythropoietin, which stimulates the production of erythrocytes.
