Angiotensin II

Angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction and an increase in systemic blood pressure. This action increases the glomerular
filtration rate, resulting in more material filtered out of the glomerular capillaries and into Bowman’s capsule. Angiotensin
II also signals an increase in the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex.

CHAPTER 26 | FLUID, ELECTROLYTE, AND ACID-BASE BALANCE 1189

 In the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys, aldosterone stimulates the synthesis and activation
of the sodium-potassium pump (Figure 26.14). Sodium passes from the filtrate, into and through the cells of the tubules
and ducts, into the ECF and then into capillaries. Water follows the sodium due to osmosis. Thus, aldosterone causes an
increase in blood sodium levels and blood volume. Aldosterone’s effect on potassium is the reverse of that of sodium; under
its influence, excess potassium is pumped into the renal filtrate for excretion from the body.
