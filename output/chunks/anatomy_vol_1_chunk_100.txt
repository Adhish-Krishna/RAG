It is especially useful for soft tissue scanning, such as of the brain and the
thoracic and abdominal viscera. Its level of detail is so precise that it can allow physicians to measure the size of a mass
down to a millimeter. The main disadvantage of CT scanning is that it exposes patients to a dose of radiation many times
higher than that of X-rays. In fact, children who undergo CT scans are at increased risk of developing cancer, as are adults
who have multiple CT scans.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive medical imaging technique based on a phenomenon of nuclear
physics discovered in the 1930s, in which matter exposed to magnetic fields and radio waves was found to emit radio
signals.
