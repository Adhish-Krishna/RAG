This is because, for one reason or another, blood is
not getting to your brain so it is briefly deprived of oxygen. When you change position from sitting or lying down to
standing, your cardiovascular system has to adjust for a new challenge, keeping blood pumping up into the head while
gravity is pulling more and more blood down into the legs.

 The reason for this is a sympathetic reflex that maintains the output of the heart in response to postural change.
 When a person stands up, proprioceptors indicate that the body is changing position. A signal goes to the CNS, which
then sends a signal to the upper thoracic spinal cord neurons of the sympathetic division. The sympathetic system
then causes the heart to beat faster and the blood vessels to constrict. Both changes will make it possible for the
cardiovascular system to maintain the rate of blood delivery to the brain. Blood is being pumped superiorly through
the internal branch of the carotid arteries into the brain, against the force of gravity.
