The walls of the joint cavity are formed by the articular capsule. Friction between the bones is reduced by a thin
layer of articular cartilage covering the surfaces of the bones, and by a lubricating synovial fluid, which is secreted by the
synovial membrane.
 Synovial joints are strengthened by the presence of ligaments, which hold the bones together and resist excessive or
abnormal movements of the joint. Ligaments are classified as extrinsic ligaments if they are located outside of the articular
capsule, intrinsic ligaments if they are fused to the wall of the articular capsule, or intracapsular ligaments if they are located
inside the articular capsule. Some synovial joints also have an articular disc (meniscus), which can provide padding between
the bones, smooth their movements, or strongly join the bones together to strengthen the joint. Muscles and their tendons
acting across a joint can also increase their contractile strength when needed, thus providing indirect support for the joint.
