It is also known that thymic involution can be altered by hormone levels. Sex hormones such as estrogen and
testosterone enhance involution, and the hormonal changes in pregnant women cause a temporary thymic involution
that reverses itself, when the size of the thymus and its hormone levels return to normal, usually after lactation ceases.
 What does all this tell us? Can we reverse immunosenescence, or at least slow it down? The potential is there for
using thymic transplants from younger donors to keep thymic output of naive T cells high. Gene therapies that target
gene expression are also seen as future possibilities. The more we learn through immunosenescence research, the more
opportunities there will be to develop therapies, even though these therapies will likely take decades to develop. The
ultimate goal is for everyone to live and be healthy longer, but there may be limits to immortality imposed by our genes
and hormones.
