Differentiate between cholinergic and adrenergic compounds
¢ Differentiate between sympathomimetic and sympatholytic drugs

¢ Relate the consequences of nicotine abuse with respect to autonomic control of the cardiovascular system

An important way to understand the effects of native neurochemicals in the autonomic system is in considering the effects
of pharmaceutical drugs. This can be considered in terms of how drugs change autonomic function. These effects will
primarily be based on how drugs act at the receptors of the autonomic system neurochemistry. The signaling molecules of
the nervous system interact with proteins in the cell membranes of various target cells. In fact, no effect can be attributed
to just the signaling molecules themselves without considering the receptors. A chemical that the body produces to interact
with those receptors is called an endogenous chemical, whereas a chemical introduced to the system from outside is an
exogenous chemical. Exogenous chemicals may be of a natural origin, such as a plant extract, or they may be synthetically
produced in a pharmaceutical laboratory.

Broad Autonomic Effects

One important drug that affects the autonomic system broadly is not a pharmaceutical therapeutic agent associated with the
system.
