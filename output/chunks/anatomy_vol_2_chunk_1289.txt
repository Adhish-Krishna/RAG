The hepatic portal vein delivers materials from these digestive and circulatory organs directly to the liver for
processing.

 Because of the hepatic portal system, the liver receives its blood supply from two different sources: from normal
systemic circulation via the hepatic artery and from the hepatic portal vein. The liver processes the blood from the portal
system to remove certain wastes and excess nutrients, which are stored for later use. This processed blood, as well as the
systemic blood that came from the hepatic artery, exits the liver via the right, left, and middle hepatic veins, and flows into
the inferior vena cava. Overall systemic blood composition remains relatively stable, since the liver is able to metabolize
the absorbed digestive components.
