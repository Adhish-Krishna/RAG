Just as you can express mathematical calculations in equations such as 2 + 7 = 9, you can use chemical equations
to show how reactants become products. As in math, chemical equations proceed from left to right, but instead of
an equal sign, they employ an arrow or arrows indicating the direction in which the chemical reaction proceeds. For
example, the chemical reaction in which one atom of nitrogen and three atoms of hydrogen produce ammonia would
be written as N + 3H > NH;. Correspondingly, the breakdown of ammonia into its components would be written as

NH, + N+3H.

Notice that, in the first example, a nitrogen (N) atom and three hydrogen (H) atoms bond to form a compound.
 This anabolic reaction requires energy, which is then stored within the compoundâ€™s bonds. Such reactions are referred to
as synthesis reactions. A synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that results in the synthesis (joining) of components
that were formerly separate (Figure 2.12a).
