The right ventricle pumps deoxygenated blood into the pulmonary trunk, which leads toward the lungs and bifurcates
into the left and right pulmonary arteries. These vessels in turn branch many times before reaching the pulmonary
capillaries, where gas exchange occurs: Carbon dioxide exits the blood and oxygen enters. The pulmonary trunk arteries
and their branches are the only arteries in the post-natal body that carry relatively deoxygenated blood. Highly oxygenated
blood returning from the pulmonary capillaries in the lungs passes through a series of vessels that join together to form the
pulmonary veinsâ€”the only post-natal veins in the body that carry highly oxygenated blood. The pulmonary veins conduct
blood into the left atrium, which pumps the blood into the left ventricle, which in turn pumps oxygenated blood into the
aorta and on to the many branches of the systemic circuit.
