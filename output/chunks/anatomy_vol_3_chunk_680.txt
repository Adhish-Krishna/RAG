By age 60, approximately 40 percent of men have some degree of BPH. By
age 80, the number of affected individuals has jumped to as many as 80 percent. Treatments for BPH attempt to relieve
the pressure on the urethra so that urine can flow more normally. Mild to moderate symptoms are treated with medication,
whereas severe enlargement of the prostate is treated by surgery in which a portion of the prostate tissue is removed.
 Another common disorder involving the prostate is prostate cancer. According to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men. However, some forms of prostate
cancer grow very slowly and thus may not ever require treatment. Aggressive forms of prostate cancer, in contrast, involve
metastasis to vulnerable organs like the lungs and brain. There is no link between BPH and prostate cancer, but the
symptoms are similar. Prostate cancer is detected by a medical history, a blood test, and a rectal exam that allows physicians
to palpate the prostate and check for unusual masses.
