The description of this withdrawal reflex was
simplified, for the sake of the introduction, to emphasize the parts of the somatic nervous system. But to consider reflexes
fully, more attention needs to be given to this example.

 As you withdraw your hand from the stove, you do not want to slow that reflex down. As the biceps brachii contracts,
the antagonistic triceps brachii needs to relax. Because the neuromuscular junction is strictly excitatory, the biceps will

contract when the motor nerve is active. Skeletal muscles do not actively relax. Instead the motor neuron needs to “quiet
down,” or be inhibited. In the hot-stove withdrawal reflex, this occurs through an interneuron in the spinal cord. The
interneuron’s cell body is located in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The interneuron receives a synapse from the axon
of the sensory neuron that detects that the hand is being burned.
