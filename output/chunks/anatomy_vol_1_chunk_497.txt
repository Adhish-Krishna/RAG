sheath covering the hair root, connecting it to the tissue of the dermis.

The hair follicle is made of multiple layers of cells that form from basal cells in the hair matrix and the hair root. Cells
of the hair matrix divide and differentiate to form the layers of the hair. Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/

 Hair serves a variety of functions, including protection, sensory input, thermoregulation, and communication. For
example, hair on the head protects the skull from the sun. The hair in the nose and ears, and around the eyes (eyelashes)
defends the body by trapping and excluding dust particles that may contain allergens and microbes. Hair of the eyebrows
prevents sweat and other particles from dripping into and bothering the eyes. Hair also has a sensory function due to sensory
innervation by a hair root plexus surrounding the base of each hair follicle.
