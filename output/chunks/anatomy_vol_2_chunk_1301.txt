Pulse, the
expansion and recoiling of an artery, reflects the heartbeat. The variables affecting blood flow and blood pressure in the
systemic circulation are cardiac output, compliance, blood volume, blood viscosity, and the length and diameter of the
blood vessels. In the arterial system, vasodilation and vasoconstriction of the arterioles is a significant factor in systemic
blood pressure: Slight vasodilation greatly decreases resistance and increases flow, whereas slight vasoconstriction greatly
increases resistance and decreases flow. In the arterial system, as resistance increases, blood pressure increases and flow
decreases. In the venous system, constriction increases blood pressure as it does in arteries; the increasing pressure helps to
return blood to the heart. In addition, constriction causes the vessel lumen to become more rounded, decreasing resistance
and increasing blood flow. Venoconstriction, while less important than arterial vasoconstriction, works with the skeletal
muscle pump, the respiratory pump, and their valves to promote venous return to the heart.
