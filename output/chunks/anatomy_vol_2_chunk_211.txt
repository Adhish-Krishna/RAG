The structure emerges from the ventral surface of the forebrain as a tapering cone that connects the brain to the
spinal cord. Attached to the brain stem, but considered a separate region of the adult brain, is the cerebellum. The midbrain
coordinates sensory representations of the visual, auditory, and somatosensory perceptual spaces. The pons is the main
connection with the cerebellum. The pons and the medulla regulate several crucial functions, including the cardiovascular
and respiratory systems and rates.

 The cranial nerves connect through the brain stem and provide the brain with the sensory input and motor output
associated with the head and neck, including most of the special senses. The major ascending and descending pathways
between the spinal cord and brain, specifically the cerebrum, pass through the brain stem.
