If a
Renal : P

person has a hematocrit of 45, then the renal plasma flow is 55 percent.
 plasma 578
flow -

1050*0.55 = 578 mL plasma/min

The GFR is the amount of plasma entering Bowman's capsule per minute. It is the
Glomerular renal plasma flow times the fraction that enters the renal capsule (19 percent
filtration 110 P P (19 p ).
 rate 578*0.19 = 110 mL filtrate/min

The filtrate not recovered by the kidney is the urine that will be eliminated. It is the

GFR times the fraction of the filtrate that is not reabsorbed (0.8 percent).

 ene F .

Urine 1296 mi/day 110*.08 = 0.9 mL urine /min

 Multiply urine/min times 60 minutes times 24 hours to get daily urine production.

 0.9*60*24 = 1296 mL/day urine

GER is influenced by the hydrostatic pressure and colloid osmotic pressure on either side of the capillary membrane
of the glomerulus.
