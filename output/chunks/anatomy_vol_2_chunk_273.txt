Age-related anosmia is not the result of impact trauma to the head, but rather a slow loss of the sensory
neurons with no new neurons born to replace them.

 Smell is an important sense, especially for the enjoyment of food. There are only five tastes sensed by the tongue,
and two of them are generally thought of as unpleasant tastes (sour and bitter). The rich sensory experience of food is
the result of odor molecules associated with the food, both as food is moved into the mouth, and therefore passes under
the nose, and when it is chewed and molecules are released to move up the pharynx into the posterior nasal cavity.
 Anosmia results in a loss of the enjoyment of food.

 As the replacement of olfactory neurons declines with age, anosmia can set in. Without the sense of smell, many
sufferers complain of food tasting bland. Often, the only way to enjoy food is to add seasoning that can be sensed
on the tongue, which usually means adding table salt.
