Antigen Processing and Presentation

Although Figure 21.16 shows T cell receptors interacting with antigenic determinants directly, the mechanism that T cells
use to recognize antigens is, in reality, much more complex. T cells do not recognize free-floating or cell-bound antigens
as they appear on the surface of the pathogen. They only recognize antigen on the surface of specialized cells called
antigen-presenting cells. Antigens are internalized by these cells. Antigen processing is a mechanism that enzymatically
cleaves the antigen into smaller pieces. The antigen fragments are then brought to the cellâ€™s surface and associated with a
specialized type of antigen-presenting protein known as a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. The MHC
is the cluster of genes that encode these antigen-presenting molecules. The association of the antigen fragments with an
MHC molecule on the surface of a cell is known as antigen presentation and results in the recognition of antigen by a
T cell.
