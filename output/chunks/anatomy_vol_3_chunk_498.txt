Mechanisms of Recovery

Mechanisms by which substances move across membranes for reabsorption or secretion include active transport, diffusion,
facilitated diffusion, secondary active transport, and osmosis. These were discussed in an earlier chapter, and you may wish
to review them.

 Active transport utilizes energy, usually the energy found in a phosphate bond of ATP, to move a substance across a

membrane from a low to a high concentration. It is very specific and must have an appropriately shaped receptor for the

substance to be transported. An example would be the active transport of Na” out of a cell and K” into a cell by the Na*/K*

pump.
