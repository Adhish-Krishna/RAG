The inner edge wraps around the
axon, creating several layers, and the other edge closes around the outside so that the axon is completely enclosed.

(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/nervefiber) to see an electron micrograph of a cross-section of a myelinated nerve fiber.
 The axon contains microtubules and neurofilaments that are bounded by a plasma membrane known as the axolemma.
 Outside the plasma membrane of the axon is the myelin sheath, which is composed of the tightly wrapped plasma
membrane of a Schwann cell. What aspects of the cells in this image react with the stain to make them a deep, dark,
black color, such as the multiple layers that are the myelin sheath?

Myelin sheaths can extend for one or two millimeters, depending on the diameter of the axon.
