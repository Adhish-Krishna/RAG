An increasingly common disease, diabetes mellitus has been diagnosed in more
than 18 million adults in the United States, and more than 200,000 children. It is estimated that up to 7 million more
adults have the condition but have not been diagnosed. In addition, approximately 79 million people in the US are
estimated to have pre-diabetes, a condition in which blood glucose levels are abnormally high, but not yet high enough
to be classified as diabetes.

 There are two main forms of diabetes mellitus. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease affecting the beta cells
of the pancreas. Certain genes are recognized to increase susceptibility. The beta cells of people with type 1 diabetes
do not produce insulin; thus, synthetic insulin must be administered by injection or infusion. This form of diabetes
accounts for less than five percent of all diabetes cases.

 Type 2 diabetes accounts for approximately 95 percent of all cases. It is acquired, and lifestyle factors such as
poor diet, inactivity, and the presence of pre-diabetes greatly increase a personâ€™s risk.
