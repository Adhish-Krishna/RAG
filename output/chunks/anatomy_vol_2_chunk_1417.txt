Unfortunately, this antibody
response is ineffective at controlling the disease, as seen by the progression of the disease towards AIDS, in which all
adaptive immune responses are compromised.

Disinfectants: Fighting the Good Fight?

“Wash your hands!” Parents have been telling their children this for generations. Dirty hands can spread disease. But
is it possible to get rid of enough pathogens that children will never get sick? Are children who avoid exposure to
pathogens better off? The answers to both these questions appears to be no.

 Antibacterial wipes, soaps, gels, and even toys with antibacterial substances embedded in their plastic are
ubiquitous in our society. Still, these products do not rid the skin and gastrointestinal tract of bacteria, and it would
be harmful to our health if they did. We need these nonpathogenic bacteria on and within our bodies to keep the
pathogenic ones from growing. The urge to keep children perfectly clean is thus probably misguided.
