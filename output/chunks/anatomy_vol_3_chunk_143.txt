Alveolar type I cells also
begin to take shape. Type II pulmonary cells develop and begin to produce small amounts of surfactant. As the fetus grows,
the respiratory system continues to expand as more alveoli develop and more surfactant is produced. Beginning at about
week 36 and lasting into childhood, alveolar precursors mature to become fully functional alveoli. At birth, compression
of the thoracic cavity forces much of the fluid in the lungs to be expelled. The first inhalation inflates the lungs. Fetal
breathing movements begin around week 20 or 21, and occur when contractions of the respiratory muscles cause the fetus
to inhale and exhale amniotic fluid. These movements continue until birth and may help to tone the muscles in preparation
for breathing after birth and are a sign of good health.
