Recall that carbon atoms have four
electrons in their valence shell, and that the octet rule dictates that atoms tend to react in such a way as to complete
their valence shell with eight electrons. Carbon atoms do not complete their valence shells by donating or accepting four
electrons. Instead, they readily share electrons via covalent bonds.

 Commonly, carbon atoms share with other carbon atoms, often forming a long carbon chain referred to as a carbon
skeleton. When they do share, however, they do not share all their electrons exclusively with each other. Rather, carbon
atoms tend to share electrons with a variety of other elements, one of which is always hydrogen. Carbon and hydrogen
groupings are called hydrocarbons. If you study the figures of organic compounds in the remainder of this chapter, you will
see several with chains of hydrocarbons in one region of the compound.
