Polyunsaturated fatty acids
contain two or more double carbon bonds, and are also liquid at room temperature. Plant oils such as olive oil typically
contain both mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids.

(a) Saturated

(b) Unsaturated

Figure 2.22 Fatty Acid Shapes The level of saturation of a fatty acid affects its shape. (a) Saturated fatty acid chains
are straight. (b) Unsaturated fatty acid chains are kinked.

 Whereas a diet high in saturated fatty acids increases the risk of heart disease, a diet high in unsaturated fatty acids is
thought to reduce the risk. This is especially true for the omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids found in cold-water fish such as
salmon. These fatty acids have their first double carbon bond at the third hydrocarbon from the methyl! group (referred to as
the omega end of the molecule).
