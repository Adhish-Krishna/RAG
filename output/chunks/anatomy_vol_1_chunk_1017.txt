The broad sheet of connective tissue
in the lower back that the latissimus dorsi muscles (the “lats”) fuse into is an example of an aponeurosis.

 Every skeletal muscle is also richly supplied by blood vessels for nourishment, oxygen delivery, and waste removal. In
addition, every muscle fiber in a skeletal muscle is supplied by the axon branch of a somatic motor neuron, which signals
the fiber to contract. Unlike cardiac and smooth muscle, the only way to functionally contract a skeletal muscle is through
signaling from the nervous system.

 Skeletal Muscle Fibers

Because skeletal muscle cells are long and cylindrical, they are commonly referred to as muscle fibers. Skeletal muscle
fibers can be quite large for human cells, with diameters up to 100 pm and lengths up to 30 cm (11.8 in) in the Sartorius of
the upper leg.
