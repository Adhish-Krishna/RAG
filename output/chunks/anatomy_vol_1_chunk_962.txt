Joints

Injuries to the knee are common. Since this joint is primarily supported by muscles and ligaments, injuries to any of
these structures will result in pain or knee instability. Injury to the posterior cruciate ligament occurs when the knee is
flexed and the tibia is driven posteriorly, such as falling and landing on the tibial tuberosity or hitting the tibia on the
dashboard when not wearing a seatbelt during an automobile accident. More commonly, injuries occur when forces
are applied to the extended knee, particularly when the foot is planted and unable to move. Anterior cruciate ligament
injuries can result with a forceful blow to the anterior knee, producing hyperextension, or when a runner makes a quick
change of direction that produces both twisting and hyperextension of the knee.
