Some
studies indicate a link between puberty onset and the amount of stored fat in an individual. This effect is more pronounced
in girls, but has been documented in both sexes. Body fat, corresponding with secretion of the hormone leptin by adipose
cells, appears to have a strong role in determining menarche. This may reflect to some extent the high metabolic costs o
gestation and lactation. In girls who are lean and highly active, such as gymnasts, there is often a delay in the onset o
puberty.
