Some cardiologists refer to the collective Si, S2, and S3 sounds as the “Kentucky gallop,” because
they mimic those produced by a galloping horse. The fourth heart sound, S4, results from the contraction of the atria pushing
blood into a stiff or hypertrophic ventricle, indicating failure of the left ventricle. S4 occurs prior to S and the collective
sounds Sq, S1, and S2 are referred to by some cardiologists as the “Tennessee gallop,” because of their similarity to the
sound produced by a galloping horse with a different gait. A few individuals may have both S3 and Sq, and this combined
sound is referred to as S7.
