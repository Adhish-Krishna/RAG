Relate cranial nerve deficits to damage of adjacent, unrelated structures

The twelve cranial nerves are typically covered in introductory anatomy courses, and memorizing their names is facilitated
by numerous mnemonics developed by students over the years of this practice. But knowing the names of the nerves in
order often leaves much to be desired in understanding what the nerves do. The nerves can be categorized by functions, and
subtests of the cranial nerve exam can clarify these functional groupings.

 Three of the nerves are strictly responsible for special senses whereas four others contain fibers for special and general
senses. Three nerves are connected to the extraocular muscles resulting in the control of gaze. Four nerves connect to
muscles of the face, oral cavity, and pharynx, controlling facial expressions, mastication, swallowing, and speech. Four
nerves make up the cranial component of the parasympathetic nervous system responsible for pupillary constriction,
salivation, and the regulation of the organs of the thoracic and upper abdominal cavities.
