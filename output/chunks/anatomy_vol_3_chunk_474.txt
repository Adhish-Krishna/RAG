Where the fenestrae (windows) in the glomerular capillaries match the spaces between
the podocyte “fingers,” the only thing separating the capillary lumen and the lumen of Bowman’s capsule is their shared
basement membrane (Figure 25.12). These three features comprise what is known as the filtration membrane. This
membrane permits very rapid movement of filtrate from capillary to capsule though pores that are only 70 nm in diameter.

Figure 25.11 Podocytes Podocytes interdigitate with structures called pedicels and filter substances in a way similar
to fenestrations. In (a), the large cell body can be seen at the top right corner, with branches extending from the
cell body. The smallest finger-like extensions are the pedicels. Pedicels on one podocyte always interdigitate with the
pedicels of another podocyte.
