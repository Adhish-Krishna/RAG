This occurs when a stimulus changes the cell membrane potential of a sensory neuron. The stimulus
causes the sensory cell to produce an action potential that is relayed into the central nervous system (CNS), where it is
integrated with other sensory information—or sometimes higher cognitive functions—to become a conscious perception of
that stimulus. The central integration may then lead to a motor response.

 Describing sensory function with the term sensation or perception is a deliberate distinction. Sensation is the activation
of sensory receptor cells at the level of the stimulus. Perception is the central processing of sensory stimuli into a meaningful
pattern. Perception is dependent on sensation, but not all sensations are perceived. Receptors are the cells or structures that
detect sensations. A receptor cell is changed directly by a stimulus. A transmembrane protein receptor is a protein in the cell
membrane that mediates a physiological change in a neuron, most often through the opening of ion channels or changes in
the cell signaling processes.
