Language and Speech

Language is, arguably, a very human aspect of neurological function. There are certainly strides being made in
understanding communication in other species, but much of what makes the human experience seemingly unique is its basis
in language. Any understanding of our species is necessarily reflective, as suggested by the question “What am I?” And the
fundamental answer to this question is suggested by the famous quote by René Descartes: “Cogito Ergo Sum” (translated
from Latin as “I think, therefore | am”). Formulating an understanding of yourself is largely describing who you are to
yourself. It is a confusing topic to delve into, but language is certainly at the core of what it means to be self-aware.

 The neurological exam has two specific subtests that address language. One measures the ability of the patient to
understand language by asking them to follow a set of instructions to perform an action, such as “touch your right finger
to your left elbow and then to your right knee.”
