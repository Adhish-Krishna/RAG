Where in the body would one find non-keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium?

Glandular Epithelium

A gland is a structure made up of one or more cells modified to synthesize and secrete chemical substances. Most glands
consist of groups of epithelial cells. A gland can be classified as an endocrine gland, a ductless gland that releases
secretions directly into surrounding tissues and fluids (endo- = “inside”), or an exocrine gland whose secretions leave

through a duct that opens directly, or indirectly, to the external environment (exo- = “outside”).
 Endocrine Glands

The secretions of endocrine glands are called hormones. Hormones are released into the interstitial fluid, diffused into the
bloodstream, and delivered to targets, in other words, cells that have receptors to bind the hormones. The endocrine system
is part of a major regulatory system coordinating the regulation and integration of body responses. A few examples of
endocrine glands include the anterior pituitary, thymus, adrenal cortex, and gonads.
