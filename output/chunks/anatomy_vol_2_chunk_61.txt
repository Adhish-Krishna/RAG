Myelin
acts as insulation much like the plastic or rubber that is used to insulate electrical wires. A key difference between myelin
and the insulation on a wire is that there are gaps in the myelin covering of an axon. Each gap is called a node of Ranvier
and is important to the way that electrical signals travel down the axon. The length of the axon between each gap, which is

wrapped in myelin, is referred to as an axon segment. At the end of the axon is the axon terminal, where there are usually
several branches extending toward the target cell, each of which ends in an enlargement called a synaptic end bulb. These
bulbs are what make the connection with the target cell at the synapse.
