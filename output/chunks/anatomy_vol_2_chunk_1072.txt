CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 821

Increased metabolic byproducts associated with increased activity, such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen ions, and lactic
acid, plus falling oxygen levels, are detected by a suite of chemoreceptors innervated by the glossopharyngeal and vagus
nerves. These chemoreceptors provide feedback to the cardiovascular centers about the need for increased or decreased
blood flow, based on the relative levels of these substances.

 The limbic system can also significantly impact HR related to emotional state. During periods of stress, it is not unusual
to identify higher than normal HRs, often accompanied by a surge in the stress hormone cortisol. Individuals experiencing
extreme anxiety may manifest panic attacks with symptoms that resemble those of heart attacks. These events are typically
transient and treatable. Meditation techniques have been developed to ease anxiety and have been shown to lower HR
effectively.
