The medial surface of the upper ilium forms
the iliac fossa, with the arcuate line marking the inferior limit of this area. The posterior margin of the ilium has the large
greater sciatic notch.
 The posterolateral portion of the hip bone is the ischium. It has the expanded ischial tuberosity, which supports body
weight when sitting. The ischial ramus projects anteriorly and superiorly. The posterior margin of the ischium has the
shallow lesser sciatic notch and the ischial spine, which separates the greater and lesser sciatic notches.
 The pubis forms the anterior portion of the hip bone. The body of the pubis articulates with the pubis of the opposite
hip bone at the pubic symphysis. The superior margin of the pubic body has the pubic tubercle. The pubis is joined to the
ilium by the superior pubic ramus, the superior surface of which forms the pectineal line. The inferior pubic ramus projects
inferiorly and laterally. The pubic arch is formed by the pubic symphysis, the bodies of the adjacent pubic bones, and the
two inferior pubic rami.
