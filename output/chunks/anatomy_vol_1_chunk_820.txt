The combination of the medial and lateral condyles with the
patellar surface gives the distal end of the femur a horseshoe (U) shape.

repaired. How are the two portions of the broken femur stabilized during surgical repair of a fractured femur?

Patella

The patella (kneecap) is largest sesamoid bone of the body (see Figure 8.16). A sesamoid bone is a bone that is incorporated
into the tendon of a muscle where that tendon crosses a joint. The sesamoid bone articulates with the underlying bones to
prevent damage to the muscle tendon due to rubbing against the bones during movements of the joint. The patella is found
in the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle, the large muscle of the anterior thigh that passes across the anterior knee
to attach to the tibia.
