Except for Purkinje cells, they are generally much smaller
than the contractile cells and have few of the myofibrils or filaments needed for contraction. Their function is similar in
many respects to neurons, although they are specialized muscle cells. Myocardial conduction cells initiate and propagate the
action potential (the electrical impulse) that travels throughout the heart and triggers the contractions that propel the blood.

 Structure of Cardiac Muscle

Compared to the giant cylinders of skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, are considerably shorter with
much smaller diameters. Cardiac muscle also demonstrates striations, the alternating pattern of dark A bands and light I
bands attributed to the precise arrangement of the myofilaments and fibrils that are organized in sarcomeres along the length
of the cell (Figure 19.17a). These contractile elements are virtually identical to skeletal muscle. T (transverse) tubules
penetrate from the surface plasma membrane, the sarcolemma, to the interior of the cell, allowing the electrical impulse to
reach the interior.
