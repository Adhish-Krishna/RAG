Glands are also named after the products they produce. The serous gland produces watery, blood-plasma-like
secretions rich in enzymes such as alpha amylase, whereas the mucous gland releases watery to viscous products rich in
the glycoprotein mucin. Both serous and mucous glands are common in the salivary glands of the mouth. Mixed exocrine
glands contain both serous and mucous glands and release both types of secretions.
