Figure 2.9 Covalent Bonding

You can see that the covalent bonds shown in Figure 2.9 are balanced. The sharing of the negative electrons is
relatively equal, as is the electrical pull of the positive protons in the nucleus of the atoms involved. This is why covalently
bonded molecules that are electrically balanced in this way are described as nonpolar; that is, no region of the molecule is
either more positive or more negative than any other.

 Polar Covalent Bonds

Groups of legislators with completely opposite views on a particular issue are often described as “polarized” by news
writers. In chemistry, a polar molecule is a molecule that contains regions that have opposite electrical charges. Polar
molecules occur when atoms share electrons unequally, in polar covalent bonds.

 The most familiar example of a polar molecule is water (Figure 2.10). The molecule has three parts: one atom of
oxygen, the nucleus of which contains eight protons, and two hydrogen atoms, whose nuclei each contain only one proton.
