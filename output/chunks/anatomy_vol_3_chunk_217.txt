The stomach is held in place by the lesser omentum, which extends from the liver to the lesser curvature, and the
greater omentum, which runs from the greater curvature to the posterior abdominal wall.

 Histology

The wall of the stomach is made of the same four layers as most of the rest of the alimentary canal, but with adaptations to
the mucosa and muscularis for the unique functions of this organ. In addition to the typical circular and longitudinal smooth
muscle layers, the muscularis has an inner oblique smooth muscle layer (Figure 23.16). As a result, in addition to moving
food through the canal, the stomach can vigorously churn food, mechanically breaking it down into smaller particles.
