The G protein is a guanosine triphosphate
(GTP) hydrolase that physically moves from the receptor protein to the effector protein to activate the latter. An effector
protein is an enzyme that catalyzes the generation of a new molecule, which acts as the intracellular mediator of the signal
that binds to the receptor. This intracellular mediator is called the second messenger.

 Different receptors use different second messengers. Two common examples of second messengers are cyclic
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and inositol triphosphate (IP3). The enzyme adenylate cyclase (an example of an
effector protein) makes cAMP, and phospholipase C is the enzyme that makes IP3. Second messengers, after they are
produced by the effector protein, cause metabolic changes within the cell. These changes are most likely the activation
of other enzymes in the cell. In neurons, they often modify ion channels, either opening or closing them. These enzymes
can also cause changes in the cell, such as the activation of genes in the nucleus, and therefore the increased synthesis of
proteins.
