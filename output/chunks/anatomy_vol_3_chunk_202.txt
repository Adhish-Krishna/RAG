In the crown of each tooth, the dentin is covered by an outer layer of
enamel, the hardest substance in the body (Figure 23.11).

 Although enamel protects the underlying dentin and pulp cavity, it is still nonetheless susceptible to mechanical and
chemical erosion, or what is known as tooth decay. The most common form, dental caries (cavities) develops when colonies
of bacteria feeding on sugars in the mouth release acids that cause soft tissue inflammation and degradation of the calcium
crystals of the enamel. The digestive functions of the mouth are summarized in Table 23.4.
