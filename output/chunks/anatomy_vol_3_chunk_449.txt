Diet can influence pH; meats lower the pH, whereas citrus fruits, vegetables, and dairy products raise the
pH. Chronically high or low pH can lead to disorders, such as the development of kidney stones or osteomalacia.

 Specific gravity is a measure of the quantity of solutes per unit volume of a solution and is traditionally easier to
measure than osmolarity. Urine will always have a specific gravity greater than pure water (water = 1.0) due to the presence
of solutes. Laboratories can now measure urine osmolarity directly, which is a more accurate indicator of urinary solutes

than specific gravity. Remember that osmolarity is the number of osmoles or milliosmoles per liter of fluid (mOsmol/L).
 Urine osmolarity ranges from a low of 50-100 mOsmol/L to as high as 1200 mOsmol/L H20.

Cells are not normally found in the urine.
