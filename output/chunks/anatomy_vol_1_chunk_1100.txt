Physiotherapists work with patients to maintain muscles. They are trained to target muscles susceptible to atrophy,
and to prescribe and monitor exercises designed to stimulate those muscles. There are various causes of atrophy,
including mechanical injury, disease, and age. After breaking a limb or undergoing surgery, muscle use is impaired and
can lead to disuse atrophy. If the muscles are not exercised, this atrophy can lead to long-term muscle weakness. A
stroke can also cause muscle impairment by interrupting neural stimulation to certain muscles. Without neural inputs,
these muscles do not contract and thus begin to lose structural proteins. Exercising these muscles can help to restore
muscle function and minimize functional impairments. Age-related muscle loss is also a target of physical therapy, as
exercise can reduce the effects of age-related atrophy and improve muscle function.

 The goal of a physiotherapist is to improve physical functioning and reduce functional impairments; this is
achieved by understanding the cause of muscle impairment and assessing the capabilities of a patient, after which
a program to enhance these capabilities is designed.
