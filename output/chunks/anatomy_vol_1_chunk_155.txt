Because every proton exerts an identical positive charge, a nucleus that contains eight protons exerts a charge eight times

greater than a nucleus that contains one proton. This means that the negatively charged electrons present in the water
molecule are more strongly attracted to the oxygen nucleus than to the hydrogen nuclei. Each hydrogen atom’s single
negative electron therefore migrates toward the oxygen atom, making the oxygen end of their bond slightly more negative
than the hydrogen end of their bond.

Figure 2.10 Polar Covalent Bonds in a Water Molecule

What is true for the bonds is true for the water molecule as a whole; that is, the oxygen region has a slightly negative
charge and the regions of the hydrogen atoms have a slightly positive charge.
