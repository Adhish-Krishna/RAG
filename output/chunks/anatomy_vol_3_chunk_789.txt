In this section, we’! cover the pre-embryonic and embryonic stages of development,
which are characterized by cell division, migration, and differentiation. By the end of the embryonic period, all of the
organ systems are structured in rudimentary form, although the organs themselves are either nonfunctional or only semi-
functional.

Pre-implantation Embryonic Development

Following fertilization, the zygote and its associated membranes, together referred to as the conceptus, continue to be
projected toward the uterus by peristalsis and beating cilia. During its journey to the uterus, the zygote undergoes five or
six rapid mitotic cell divisions. Although each cleavage results in more cells, it does not increase the total volume of the
conceptus (Figure 28.4). Each daughter cell produced by cleavage is called a blastomere (blastos = “germ,” in the sense of
a seed or sprout).
