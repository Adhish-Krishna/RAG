Triglycerides and lipids, high-energy molecules, are stored in adipose tissue until
they are needed.

 Although lipogenesis occurs in the cytoplasm, the necessary acetyl CoA is created in the mitochondria and cannot
be transported across the mitochondrial membrane. To solve this problem, pyruvate is converted into both oxaloacetate
and acetyl CoA. Two different enzymes are required for these conversions. Oxaloacetate forms via the action of pyruvate
carboxylase, whereas the action of pyruvate dehydrogenase creates acetyl CoA. Oxaloacetate and acetyl CoA combine to
form citrate, which can cross the mitochondrial membrane and enter the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, citrate is converted
back into oxaloacetate and acetyl CoA. Oxaloacetate is converted into malate and then into pyruvate. Pyruvate crosses back
across the mitochondrial membrane to wait for the next cycle of lipogenesis. The acetyl CoA is converted into malonyl CoA
that is used to synthesize fatty acids. Figure 24.16 summarizes the pathways of lipid metabolism.
