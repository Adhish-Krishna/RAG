 23.7 | Chemical Digestion and Absorption: A Closer Look

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Â¢ Identify the locations and primary secretions involved in the chemical digestion of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids,
and nucleic acids

* Compare and contrast absorption of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic nutrients

As you have learned, the process of mechanical digestion is relatively simple. It involves the physical breakdown of food
but does not alter its chemical makeup. Chemical digestion, on the other hand, is a complex process that reduces food into
its chemical building blocks, which are then absorbed to nourish the cells of the body (Figure 23.28).
