As useful as analyzing these electrical recordings may be, there are limitations. For example, not all areas
suffering a MI may be obvious on the ECG. Additionally, it will not reveal the effectiveness of the pumping, which
requires further testing, such as an ultrasound test called an echocardiogram or nuclear medicine imaging. It is also
possible for there to be pulseless electrical activity, which will show up on an ECG tracing, although there is no
corresponding pumping action. Common abnormalities that may be detected by the ECGs are shown in Figure 19.25.
