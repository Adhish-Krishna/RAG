Helium, as well as larger atoms with eight electrons in
their valence shell, is unlikely to participate in chemical reactions because they are stable. All other atoms tend to accept,
donate, or share electrons in a process that brings the electrons in their valence shell to eight (or in the case of hydrogen, to
two).

2.2 Chemical Bonds

Each moment of life, atoms of oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and the other elements of the human body are making and
breaking chemical bonds. Ions are charged atoms that form when an atom donates or accepts one or more negatively charged
electrons. Cations (ions with a positive charge) are attracted to anions (ions with a negative charge). This attraction is called
an ionic bond. In covalent bonds, the participating atoms do not lose or gain electrons, but rather share them. Molecules
with nonpolar covalent bonds are electrically balanced, and have a linear three-dimensional shape.
