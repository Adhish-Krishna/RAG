CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 517

Human (bipedal) Dog (quadripedal)

- .

 Figure 13.4 Human Neuraxis The mammalian nervous system is arranged with the neural tube running along an
anterior to posterior axis, from nose to tail for a four-legged animal like a dog. Humans, as two-legged animals, have
a bend in the neuraxis between the brain stem and the diencephalon, along with a bend in the neck, so that the eyes
and the face are oriented forward.

 In summary, the primary vesicles help to establish the basic regions of the nervous system: forebrain, midbrain, and
hindbrain. These divisions are useful in certain situations, but they are not equivalent regions. The midbrain is small
compared with the hindbrain and particularly the forebrain. The secondary vesicles go on to establish the major regions
of the adult nervous system that will be followed in this text.
