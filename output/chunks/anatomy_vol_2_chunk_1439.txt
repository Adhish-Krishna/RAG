(b) The diagram shows a variety of possible symptoms of systemic
lupus erythematosus.

 Environmental triggers seem to play large roles in autoimmune responses. One explanation for the breakdown of
tolerance is that, after certain bacterial infections, an immune response to a component of the bacterium cross-reacts with
a self-antigen. This mechanism is seen in rheumatic fever, a result of infection with Streptococcus bacteria, which causes
strep throat. The antibodies to this pathogenâ€™s M protein cross-react with an antigenic component of heart myosin, a major
contractile protein of the heart that is critical to its normal function. The antibody binds to these molecules and activates
complement proteins, causing damage to the heart, especially to the heart valves. On the other hand, some theories propose
that having multiple common infectious diseases actually prevents autoimmune responses. The fact that autoimmune
diseases are rare in countries that have a high incidence of infectious diseases supports this idea, another example of the
hygiene hypothesis discussed earlier in this chapter.
