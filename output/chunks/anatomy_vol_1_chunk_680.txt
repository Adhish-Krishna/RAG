It provides for passage of the
optic nerve into the orbit.
 ¢ Superior orbital fissure—This large, irregular opening into the posterior orbit is located on the anterior wall of the
middle cranial fossa, lateral to the optic canal and under the projecting margin of the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone.
 Nerves to the eyeball and associated muscles, and sensory nerves to the forehead pass through this opening.
 ¢ Foramen rotundum—This rounded opening (rotundum = “round”) is located in the floor of the middle cranial fossa,
just inferior to the superior orbital fissure. It is the exit point for a major sensory nerve that supplies the cheek, nose,
and upper teeth.
 ¢ Foramen ovale of the middle cranial fossa—This large, oval-shaped opening in the floor of the middle cranial fossa
provides passage for a major sensory nerve to the lateral head, cheek, chin, and lower teeth.
