The presence of RDS can lead to other serious disorders, such as septicemia (infection of the blood) or pulmonary
hemorrhage. Therefore, it is important that RDS is immediately recognized and treated to prevent death and reduce the
risk of developing other disorders.

 Medical advances have resulted in an improved ability to treat RDS and support the infant until proper lung
development can occur. At the time of delivery, treatment may include resuscitation and intubation if the infant does
not breathe on his or her own. These infants would need to be placed on a ventilator to mechanically assist with the
breathing process. If spontaneous breathing occurs, application of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
may be required. In addition, pulmonary surfactant is typically administered. Death due to RDS has been reduced
by 50 percent due to the introduction of pulmonary surfactant therapy. Other therapies may include corticosteroids,
supplemental oxygen, and assisted ventilation. Supportive therapies, such as temperature regulation, nutritional
support, and antibiotics, may be administered to the premature infant as well.
