Some nephrons have a short loop of Henle that does not dip beyond the cortex. These nephrons are called

cortical nephrons. About 15 percent of nephrons have long loops of Henle that extend deep into the medulla and are called
juxtamedullary nephrons.

 25.4 | Microscopic Anatomy of the Kidney

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 ¢ Distinguish the histological differences between the renal cortex and medulla
* Describe the structure of the filtration membrane
¢ Identify the major structures and subdivisions of the renal corpuscles, renal tubules, and renal capillaries
 ¢ Discuss the function of the peritubular capillaries and vasa recta
¢ Identify the location of the juxtaglomerular apparatus and describe the cells that line it

* Describe the histology of the proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule, and collecting
ducts

The renal structures that conduct the essential work of the kidney cannot be seen by the naked eye.
