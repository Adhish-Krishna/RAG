These
patients are unable to process the glucose in their blood and therefore must rely on other sources of fuel. If the disease is not
controlled properly, this inability to process the glucose can lead to starvation states even though the patient is eating. 39 When
triglycerides and fatty acids are broken down, acetyl CoA is created. If excess acetyl CoA is generated in this process, the excess is
used in ketogenesis or the creation of ketones. This creation results from the conversion of acetyl CoA by thiolase into acetoacetyl
CoA. This acetoacetyl CoA is subsequently converted into B-hydroxybutyrate, the most common ketone in the body. 40 When
blood flows to the outer layers of the skin or to the extremities, heat is lost to the environment by the mechanisms of conduction,
convection, or radiation. This will cool the blood and the body. Vasoconstriction helps increase the core body temperature by
preventing the flow of blood to the outer layer of the skin and outer parts of the extremities.
