Because the actin and its troponin-
tropomyosin complex (projecting from the Z-discs toward the center of the sarcomere) form strands that are thinner than
the myosin, it is called the thin filament of the sarcomere. Likewise, because the myosin strands and their multiple heads

(projecting from the center of the sarcomere, toward but not all to way to, the Z-discs) have more mass and are thicker, they
are called the thick filament of the sarcomere.
