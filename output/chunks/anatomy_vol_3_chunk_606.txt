These ions enter the body through the digestive tract. More than 90 percent
of the calcium and phosphate that enters the body is incorporated into bones and teeth, with bone serving as a mineral
reserve for these ions. In the event that calcium and phosphate are needed for other functions, bone tissue can be broken
down to supply the blood and other tissues with these minerals. Phosphate is a normal constituent of nucleic acids; hence,
blood levels of phosphate will increase whenever nucleic acids are broken down.

 Excretion of ions occurs mainly through the kidneys, with lesser amounts lost in sweat and in feces. Excessive sweating
may cause a significant loss, especially of sodium and chloride. Severe vomiting or diarrhea will cause a loss of chloride
and bicarbonate ions. Adjustments in respiratory and renal functions allow the body to regulate the levels of these ions in
the ECF.

Table 26.1 lists the reference values for blood plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and urine for the six ions addressed
in this section.
