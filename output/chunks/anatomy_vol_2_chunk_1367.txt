Leukotrienes attract neutrophils from the blood by chemotaxis and increase vascular permeability.
 Prostaglandins cause vasodilation by relaxing vascular smooth muscle and are a major cause of the pain associated
with inflammation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen relieve pain by inhibiting
prostaglandin production.

 * Vasodilation. Many inflammatory mediators such as histamine are vasodilators that increase the diameters of loca
capillaries. This causes increased blood flow and is responsible for the heat and redness of inflamed tissue. It allows
greater access of the blood to the site of inflammation.

 * Increased Vascular Permeability. At the same time, inflammatory mediators increase the permeability of the loca
vasculature, causing leakage of fluid into the interstitial space, resulting in the swelling, or edema, associated with
inflammation.

 * Recruitment of Phagocytes. Leukotrienes are particularly good at attracting neutrophils from the blood to the site
of infection by chemotaxis. Following an early neutrophil infiltrate stimulated by macrophage cytokines, more
macrophages are recruited to clean up the debris left over at the site.
