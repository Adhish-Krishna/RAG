The actions of the skeletal muscles will be covered in a regional manner, working from the head down to the
toes.

 11.1 | Interactions of Skeletal Muscles, Their Fascicle
Arrangement, and Their Lever Systems

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Compare and contrast agonist and antagonist muscles
* Describe how fascicles are arranged within a skeletal muscle
¢ Explain the major events of a skeletal muscle contraction within a muscle in generating force

To move the skeleton, the tension created by the contraction of the fibers in most skeletal muscles is transferred to
the tendons. The tendons are strong bands of dense, regular connective tissue that connect muscles to bones. The bone
connection is why this muscle tissue is called skeletal muscle.

 Interactions of Skeletal Muscles in the Body

To pull on a bone, that is, to change the angle at its synovial joint, which essentially moves the skeleton, a skeletal muscle
must also be attached to a fixed part of the skeleton.
