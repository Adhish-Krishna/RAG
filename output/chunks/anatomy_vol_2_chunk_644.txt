Signs that suggest a UMN lesion include muscle weakness, strong deep tendon
reflexes, decreased control of movement or slowness, pronator drift, a positive Babinski sign, spasticity, and the clasp-
knife response. Spasticity is an excess contraction in resistance to stretch. It can result in hyperflexia, which is when joints
are overly flexed. The clasp-knife response occurs when the patient initially resists movement, but then releases, and the
joint will quickly flex like a pocket knife closing.

 A lesion on the LMN would result in paralysis, or at least partial loss of voluntary muscle control, which is known as
paresis. The paralysis observed in LMN diseases is referred to as flaccid paralysis, referring to a complete or partial loss

of muscle tone, in contrast to the loss of control in UMN lesions in which tone is retained and spasticity is exhibited.
