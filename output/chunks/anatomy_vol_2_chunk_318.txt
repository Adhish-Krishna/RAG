The odorant—protein complex binds to a receptor protein within
the cell membrane of an olfactory dendrite. These receptors are G protein-coupled, and will produce a graded membrane
potential in the olfactory neurons.

 The axon of an olfactory neuron extends from the basal surface of the epithelium, through an olfactory foramen in
the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, and into the brain. The group of axons called the olfactory tract connect to the
olfactory bulb on the ventral surface of the frontal lobe. From there, the axons split to travel to several brain regions. Some
travel to the cerebrum, specifically to the primary olfactory cortex that is located in the inferior and medial areas of the
temporal lobe. Others project to structures within the limbic system and hypothalamus, where smells become associated
with long-term memory and emotional responses. This is how certain smells trigger emotional memories, such as the smell
of food associated with one’s birthplace.
