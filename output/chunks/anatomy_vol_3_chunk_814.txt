(This is a temporary responsibility
of the embryonic liver that the bone marrow will assume during fetal development.) During weeks 4-5, the eye pits form,
limb buds become apparent, and the rudiments of the pulmonary system are formed.

 During the sixth week, uncontrolled fetal limb movements begin to occur. The gastrointestinal system develops too
rapidly for the embryonic abdomen to accommodate it, and the intestines temporarily loop into the umbilical cord. Paddle-
shaped hands and feet develop fingers and toes by the process of apoptosis (programmed cell death), which causes the
tissues between the fingers to disintegrate. By week 7, the facial structure is more complex and includes nostrils, outer
ears, and lenses (Figure 28.15). By the eighth week, the head is nearly as large as the rest of the embryoâ€™s body, and all
major brain structures are in place.
