This diagram outlines the embryological development of the human
heart during the first eight weeks and the subsequent formation of the four heart chambers.

 The five regions of the primitive heart tube develop into recognizable structures in a fully developed heart. The truncus
arteriosus will eventually divide and give rise to the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk. The bulbus cordis develops into
the right ventricle. The primitive ventricle forms the left ventricle. The primitive atrium becomes the anterior portions of
both the right and left atria, and the two auricles. The sinus venosus develops into the posterior portion of the right atrium,
the SA node, and the coronary sinus.

 As the primitive heart tube elongates, it begins to fold within the pericardium, eventually forming an S shape, which
places the chambers and major vessels into an alignment similar to the adult heart.
