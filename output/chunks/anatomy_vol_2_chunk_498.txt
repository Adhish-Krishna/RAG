Gravity is not increasing while
standing, but blood is more likely to flow down into the legs as they are extended for standing. This sympathetic reflex
keeps the brain well oxygenated so that cognitive and other neural processes are not interrupted.

 Sometimes this does not work properly. If the sympathetic system cannot increase cardiac output, then blood
pressure into the brain will decrease, and a brief neurological loss can be felt. This can be brief, as a slight “wooziness”
when standing up too quickly, or a loss of balance and neurological impairment for a period of time. The name for this
is orthostatic hypotension, which means that blood pressure goes below the homeostatic set point when standing. It
can be the result of standing up faster than the reflex can occur, which may be referred to as a benign “head rush,” or
it may be the result of an underlying cause.
