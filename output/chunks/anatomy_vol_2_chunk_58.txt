Neurons are the primary type of cell that most
anyone associates with the nervous system. They are responsible for the computation and communication that the nervous
system provides. They are electrically active and release chemical signals to target cells. Glial cells, or glia, are known to
play a supporting role for nervous tissue. Ongoing research pursues an expanded role that glial cells might play in signaling,
but neurons are still considered the basis of this function. Neurons are important, but without glial support they would not
be able to perform their function.

 Neurons

Neurons are the cells considered to be the basis of nervous tissue. They are responsible for the electrical signals that
communicate information about sensations, and that produce movements in response to those stimuli, along with inducing
thought processes within the brain. An important part of the function of neurons is in their structure, or shape. The three-
dimensional shape of these cells makes the immense numbers of connections within the nervous system possible.
