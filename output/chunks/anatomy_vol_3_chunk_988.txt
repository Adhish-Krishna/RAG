33 The muscles of the anterior neck are arranged to facilitate swallowing and
speech. They work on the hyoid bone, with the suprahyoid muscles pulling up and the infrahyoid muscles pulling down. 34 Most
skeletal muscles create movement by actions on the skeleton. Facial muscles are different in that they create facial movements
and expressions by pulling on the skinâ€”no bone movements are involved. 35 Arranged into layers, the muscles of the abdominal
wall are the internal and external obliques, which run on diagonals, the rectus abdominis, which runs straight down the midline of
the body, and the transversus abdominis, which wraps across the trunk of the body. 36 Both diaphragms are thin sheets of skeletal
muscle that horizontally span areas of the trunk. The diaphragm separating the thoracic and abdominal cavities is the primary
muscle of breathing. The pelvic diaphragm, consisting of two paired muscles, the coccygeus and the levator ani, forms the pelvic
floor at the inferior end of the trunk.
