34 Any imbalance of water entering or leaving the body will create an osmotic
imbalance that will adversely affect cell and tissue function. 35 Very little of the carbon dioxide in the blood is carried dissolved
in the plasma. It is transformed into carbonic acid and then into bicarbonate in order to mix in plasma for transportation to the
lungs, where it reverts back to its gaseous form. 36 Without having an absolute excess or deficiency of a substance, one can have
too much or too little of that substance in a given compartment. Such a relative increase or decrease is due to a redistribution of
water or the ion in the bodyâ€™s compartments. This may be due to the loss of water in the blood, leading to a hemoconcentration or
dilution of the ion in tissues due to edema. 37 Bicarbonate ions are freely filtered through the glomerulus. They cannot pass freely
into the renal tubular cells and must be converted into CO? in the filtrate, which can pass through the cell membrane.
