B cells can recognize native, unprocessed antigen
and do not require the participation of MHC molecules and antigen-presenting cells.

B Cell Differentiation and Activation

B cells differentiate in the bone marrow. During the process of maturation, up to 100 trillion different clones of B cells are
generated, which is similar to the diversity of antigen receptors seen in T cells.

 B cell differentiation and the development of tolerance are not quite as well understood as it is in T cells. Central
tolerance is the destruction or inactivation of B cells that recognize self-antigens in the bone marrow, and its role is critical
and well established. In the process of clonal deletion, immature B cells that bind strongly to self-antigens expressed on
tissues are signaled to commit suicide by apoptosis, removing them from the population.
