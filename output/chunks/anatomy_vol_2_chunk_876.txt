Once they have exited the capillaries, some leukocytes will take up fixed positions in lymphatic tissue, bone marrow,
the spleen, the thymus, or other organs. Others will move about through the tissue spaces very much like amoebas,
continuously extending their plasma membranes, sometimes wandering freely, and sometimes moving toward the direction
in which they are drawn by chemical signals. This attracting of leukocytes occurs because of positive chemotaxis (literally
“movement in response to chemicals”), a phenomenon in which injured or infected cells and nearby leukocytes emit the
equivalent of a chemical “911” call, attracting more leukocytes to the site. In clinical medicine, the differential counts of the
types and percentages of leukocytes present are often key indicators in making a diagnosis and selecting a treatment.
