Carbon dioxide is produced in large amounts in tissues that have a high metabolic rate. Carbon
dioxide is converted into bicarbonate in the cytoplasm of red blood cells through the action of an enzyme called carbonic
anhydrase. Bicarbonate is transported in the blood. Once in the lungs, the reactions reverse direction, and CO? is regenerated
from bicarbonate to be exhaled as metabolic waste.

 Calcium

About two pounds of calcium in your body are bound up in bone, which provides hardness to the bone and serves as a
mineral reserve for calcium and its salts for the rest of the tissues. Teeth also have a high concentration of calcium within
them. A little more than one-half of blood calcium is bound to proteins, leaving the rest in its ionized form. Calcium ions,

Ca**, are necessary for muscle contraction, enzyme activity, and blood coagulation. In addition, calcium helps to stabilize
cell membranes and is essential for the release of neurotransmitters from neurons and of hormones from endocrine glands.
