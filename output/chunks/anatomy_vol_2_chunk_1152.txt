Pulse

After blood is ejected from the heart, elastic fibers in the arteries help maintain a high-pressure gradient as they expand to
accommodate the blood, then recoil. This expansion and recoiling effect, known as the pulse, can be palpated manually or
measured electronically. Although the effect diminishes over distance from the heart, elements of the systolic and diastolic
components of the pulse are still evident down to the level of the arterioles.

 Because pulse indicates heart rate, it is measured clinically to provide clues to a patientâ€™s state of health. It is recorded
as beats per minute. Both the rate and the strength of the pulse are important clinically. A high or irregular pulse rate can
be caused by physical activity or other temporary factors, but it may also indicate a heart condition. The pulse strength
indicates the strength of ventricular contraction and cardiac output. If the pulse is strong, then systolic pressure is high. If it
is weak, systolic pressure has fallen, and medical intervention may be warranted.
