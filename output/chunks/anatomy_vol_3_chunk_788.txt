Throughout this chapter, we will express embryonic and fetal ages in terms of weeks from fertilization, commonly called
conception. The period of time required for full development of a fetus in utero is referred to as gestation (gestare = “to
carry” or “to bear”). It can be subdivided into distinct gestational periods. The first 2 weeks of prenatal development are
referred to as the pre-embryonic stage. A developing human is referred to as an embryo during weeks 3-8, and a fetus from
the ninth week of gestation until birth.
