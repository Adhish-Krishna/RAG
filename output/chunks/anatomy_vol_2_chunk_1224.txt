These vessels will be described
more fully later in this section. This blood is relatively low in oxygen and relatively high in carbon dioxide, since much of
the oxygen has been extracted for use by the tissues and the waste gas carbon dioxide was picked up to be transported to
the lungs for elimination. From the right atrium, blood moves into the right ventricle, which pumps it to the lungs for gas
exchange. This system of vessels is referred to as the pulmonary circuit.

 The single vessel exiting the right ventricle is the pulmonary trunk. At the base of the pulmonary trunk is the
pulmonary semilunar valve, which prevents backflow of blood into the right ventricle during ventricular diastole. As the
pulmonary trunk reaches the superior surface of the heart, it curves posteriorly and rapidly bifurcates (divides) into two
branches, a left and a right pulmonary artery.
