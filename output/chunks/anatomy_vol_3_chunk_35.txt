Figure 22.10 Respiratory Zone Bronchioles lead to alveolar sacs in the respiratory zone, where gas exchange
occurs.

 Alveoli

An alveolar duct is a tube composed of smooth muscle and connective tissue, which opens into a cluster of alveoli. An
alveolus is one of the many small, grape-like sacs that are attached to the alveolar ducts.

 An alveolar sac is a cluster of many individual alveoli that are responsible for gas exchange. An alveolus is
approximately 200 mm in diameter with elastic walls that allow the alveolus to stretch during air intake, which greatly
increases the surface area available for gas exchange. Alveoli are connected to their neighbors by alveolar pores, which
help maintain equal air pressure throughout the alveoli and lung (Figure 22.11).
