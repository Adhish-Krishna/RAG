The paranasal sinuses are hollow, air-filled spaces named for the skull bone that
each occupies. The most anterior is the frontal sinus, located in the frontal bone above the eyebrows. The largest are
the maxillary sinuses, located in the right and left maxillary bones below the orbits. The most posterior is the sphenoid
sinus, located in the body of the sphenoid bone, under the sella turcica. The ethmoid air cells are multiple small spaces
located in the right and left sides of the ethmoid bone, between the medial wall of the orbit and lateral wall of the upper
nasal cavity.

 Hyoid Bone

The hyoid bone is an independent bone that does not contact any other bone and thus is not part of the skull (Figure 7.19).
 It is a small U-shaped bone located in the upper neck near the level of the inferior mandible, with the tips of the “U”
pointing posteriorly.
