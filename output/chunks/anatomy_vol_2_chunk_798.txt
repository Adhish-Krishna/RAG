With increasing age, the ovaries decrease in both size and weight and become progressively less sensitive to
gonadotropins. This gradually causes a decrease in estrogen and progesterone levels, leading to menopause and the inability
to reproduce. Low levels of estrogens and progesterone are also associated with some disease states, such as osteoporosis,
atherosclerosis, and hyperlipidemia, or abnormal blood lipid levels.

 Testosterone levels also decline with age, a condition called andropause (or viropause); however, this decline is much
less dramatic than the decline of estrogens in women, and much more gradual, rarely affecting sperm production until
very old age. Although this means that males maintain their ability to father children for decades longer than females, the
quantity, quality, and motility of their sperm is often reduced.
 As the body ages, the thyroid gland produces less of the thyroid hormones, causing a gradual decrease in the basal
metabolic rate.
