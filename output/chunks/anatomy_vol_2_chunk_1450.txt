Other examples of cancers caused by viruses include
liver cancer caused by the hepatitis B virus and cervical cancer caused by the human papilloma virus. As these last two
viruses have vaccines available for them, getting vaccinated can help prevent these two types of cancer by stimulating the
immune response.

On the other hand, as cancer cells are often able to divide and mutate rapidly, they may escape the immune response,
just as certain pathogens such as HIV do. There are three stages in the immune response to many cancers: elimination,
equilibrium, and escape. Elimination occurs when the immune response first develops toward tumor-specific antigens
specific to the cancer and actively kills most cancer cells, followed by a period of controlled equilibrium during which
the remaining cancer cells are held in check.
