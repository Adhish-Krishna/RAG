One of the features that make bone marrow transplants work as well as they do is the proliferative
capability of hematopoietic stem cells of the bone marrow. Only a small amount of bone marrow from a healthy donor is
given intravenously to the recipient. It finds its own way to the bone where it populates it, eventually reconstituting the
patientâ€™s immune system, which is usually destroyed beforehand by treatment with radiation or chemotherapeutic drugs.

 New treatments for SCID using gene therapy, inserting nondefective genes into cells taken from the patient and giving
them back, have the advantage of not needing the tissue match required for standard transplants. Although not a standard
treatment, this approach holds promise, especially for those in whom standard bone marrow transplantation has failed.

 Human Immunodeficiency Virus/AIDS

 Although many viruses cause suppression of the immune system, only one wipes it out completely, and that is the previously
mentioned HIV.
