Like beads in a long necklace, these monomers
link by covalent bonds to form long polymers (poly- = “many”). There are many examples of monomers and polymers
among the organic compounds.

 Monomers form polymers by engaging in dehydration synthesis (see Figure 2.14). As was noted earlier, this reaction
results in the release of a molecule of water. Each monomer contributes: One gives up a hydrogen atom and the other
gives up a hydroxyl group. Polymers are split into monomers by hydrolysis (-lysis = “rupture”). The bonds between their
monomers are broken, via the donation of a molecule of water, which contributes a hydrogen atom to one monomer and a
hydroxyl group to the other.

 Carbohydrates

The term carbohydrate means “hydrated carbon.” Recall that the root hydro- indicates water. A carbohydrate is a molecule
composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen; in most carbohydrates, hydrogen and oxygen are found in the same two-to-one
relative proportions they have in water.
