When the myocardium of the ventricle contracts, pressure within the ventricular chamber rises. Blood, like any fluid,
flows from higher pressure to lower pressure areas, in this case, toward the pulmonary trunk and the atrium. To prevent any
potential backflow, the papillary muscles also contract, generating tension on the chordae tendineae. This prevents the flaps
of the valves from being forced into the atria and regurgitation of the blood back into the atria during ventricular contraction.
 Figure 19.11 shows papillary muscles and chordae tendineae attached to the tricuspid valve.

Figure 19.11 Chordae Tendineae and Papillary Muscles In this frontal section, you can see papillary muscles
attached to the tricuspid valve on the right as well as the mitral valve on the left via chordae tendineae.
