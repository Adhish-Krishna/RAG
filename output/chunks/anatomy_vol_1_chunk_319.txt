One of the most important classes of proteins is enzymes, which help speed
up necessary biochemical reactions that take place inside the cell. Some of these critical biochemical reactions include
building larger molecules from smaller components (such as occurs during DNA replication or synthesis of microtubules)
and breaking down larger molecules into smaller components (such as when harvesting chemical energy from nutrient
molecules). Whatever the cellular process may be, it is almost sure to involve proteins. Just as the cell’s genome describes
its full complement of DNA, a cell’s proteome is its full complement of proteins. Protein synthesis begins with genes. A
gene is a functional segment of DNA that provides the genetic information necessary to build a protein. Each particular gene
provides the code necessary to construct a particular protein. Gene expression, which transforms the information coded in a
gene to a final gene product, ultimately dictates the structure and function of a cell by determining which proteins are made.
