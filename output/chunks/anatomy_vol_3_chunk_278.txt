The presence of proteins and fats in the duodenum stimulates the secretion of CCK, which then

stimulates the acini to secrete enzyme-rich pancreatic juice and enhances the activity of secretin. Parasympathetic regulation
occurs mainly during the cephalic and gastric phases of gastric secretion, when vagal stimulation prompts the secretion of
pancreatic juice.

 Usually, the pancreas secretes just enough bicarbonate to counterbalance the amount of HCI produced in the stomach.
 Hydrogen ions enter the blood when bicarbonate is secreted by the pancreas. Thus, the acidic blood draining from the
pancreas neutralizes the alkaline blood draining from the stomach, maintaining the pH of the venous blood that flows to the
liver.

 The Gallbladder

The gallbladder is 8-10 cm (~3-4 in) long and is nested in a shallow area on the posterior aspect of the right lobe of the
liver.
