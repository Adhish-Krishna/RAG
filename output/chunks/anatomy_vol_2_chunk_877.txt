 Figure 18.10 Emigration Leukocytes exit the blood vessel and then move through the connective tissue of the dermis
toward the site of a wound. Some leukocytes, such as the eosinophil and neutrophil, are characterized as granular
leukocytes. They release chemicals from their granules that destroy pathogens; they are also capable of phagocytosis.
 The monocyte, an agranular leukocyte, differentiates into a macrophage that then phagocytizes the pathogens.
