The lower back contains the L1â€”L5 lumbar vertebrae. The single sacrum, which is also part of the pelvis, is formed by the
fusion of five sacral vertebrae. Similarly, the coccyx, or tailbone, results from the fusion of four small coccygeal vertebrae.
 However, the sacral and coccygeal fusions do not start until age 20 and are not completed until middle age.

 An interesting anatomical fact is that almost all mammals have seven cervical vertebrae, regardless of body size. This
means that there are large variations in the size of cervical vertebrae, ranging from the very small cervical vertebrae of a
shrew to the greatly elongated vertebrae in the neck of a giraffe. In a full-grown giraffe, each cervical vertebra is 11 inches
tall.

 Curvatures of the Vertebral Column

The adult vertebral column does not form a straight line, but instead has four curvatures along its length (see Figure
7.20).
