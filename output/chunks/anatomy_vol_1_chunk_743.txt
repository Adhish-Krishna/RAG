Attached posteriorly to the body is a vertebral arch, which surrounds and defines the vertebral foramen for passage of the
spinal cord. The vertebral arch consists of the pedicles, which attach to the vertebral body, and the laminae, which come
together to form the roof of the arch. Arising from the vertebral arch are the laterally projecting transverse processes and
the posteriorly oriented spinous process. The superior articular processes project upward, where they articulate with the
downward projecting inferior articular processes of the next higher vertebrae.

 A typical cervical vertebra has a small body, a bifid (Y-shaped) spinous process, and U-shaped transverse processes
with a transverse foramen. In addition to these characteristics, the axis (C2 vertebra) also has the dens projecting upward
from the vertebral body. The atlas (C1 vertebra) differs from the other cervical vertebrae in that it does not have a body, but
instead consists of bony ring formed by the anterior and posterior arches.
