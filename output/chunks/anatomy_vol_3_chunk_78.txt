In addition to these treatments, patients with central sleep apnea may need supplemental
oxygen during sleep.

 22.4 | Gas Exchange

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Compare the composition of atmospheric air and alveolar air
¢ Describe the mechanisms that drive gas exchange
 ¢ Discuss the importance of sufficient ventilation and perfusion, and how the body adapts when they are insufficient
* Discuss the process of external respiration
* Describe the process of internal respiration

The purpose of the respiratory system is to per

orm gas exchange. Pulmonary ventilation provides air to the alveoli for this

gas exchange process. At the respiratory membrane, where the alveolar and capillary walls meet, gases move across the
membranes, with oxygen entering the bloodstream and carbon dioxide exiting. It is through this mechanism that blood is
oxygenated and carbon dioxide, the waste product of cellular respiration, is removed from the body.
