A lysosome is an organelle that contains enzymes that break down and digest unneeded
cellular components, such as a damaged organelle. (A lysosome is similar to a wrecking crew that takes down old and
unsound buildings in a neighborhood.) Autophagy (“self-eating”) is the process of a cell digesting its own structures.
 Lysosomes are also important for breaking down foreign material. For example, when certain immune defense cells (white
blood cells) phagocytize bacteria, the bacterial cell is transported into a lysosome and digested by the enzymes inside. As
one might imagine, such phagocytic defense cells contain large numbers of lysosomes.

 Under certain circumstances, lysosomes perform a more grand and dire function. In the case of damaged or unhealthy
cells, lysosomes can be triggered to open up and release their digestive enzymes into the cytoplasm of the cell, killing the
cell.
