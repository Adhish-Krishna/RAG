Figure 22.6 Divisions of the Pharynx The pharynx is divided into three regions: the nasopharynx, the oropharynx,
and the laryngopharynx.

 The nasopharynx is flanked by the conchae of the nasal cavity, and it serves only as an airway. At the top of the
nasopharynx are the pharyngeal tonsils. A pharyngeal tonsil, also called an adenoid, is an aggregate of lymphoid reticular
tissue similar to a lymph node that lies at the superior portion of the nasopharynx. The function of the pharyngeal tonsil
is not well understood, but it contains a rich supply of lymphocytes and is covered with ciliated epithelium that traps and
destroys invading pathogens that enter during inhalation. The pharyngeal tonsils are large in children, but interestingly, tend
to regress with age and may even disappear.
