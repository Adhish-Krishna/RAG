Midbrain

One of the original regions of the embryonic brain, the midbrain is a small region between the thalamus and pons. It is
separated into the tectum and tegmentum, from the Latin words for roof and floor, respectively. The cerebral aqueduct
passes through the center of the midbrain, such that these regions are the roof and floor of that canal.

 The tectum is composed of four bumps known as the colliculi (singular = colliculus), which means “little hill” in Latin.
 The inferior colliculus is the inferior pair of these enlargements and is part of the auditory brain stem pathway. Neurons
of the inferior colliculus project to the thalamus, which then sends auditory information to the cerebrum for the conscious
perception of sound. The superior colliculus is the superior pair and combines sensory information about visual space,
auditory space, and somatosensory space. Activity in the superior colliculus is related to orienting the eyes to a sound or
touch stimulus.
