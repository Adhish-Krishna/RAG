Circular folds

Also called a plica circulare, a circular fold is a deep ridge in the mucosa and submucosa. Beginning near the proximal part
of the duodenum and ending near the middle of the ileum, these folds facilitate absorption. Their shape causes the chyme to
spiral, rather than move in a straight line, through the small intestine. Spiraling slows the movement of chyme and provides
the time needed for nutrients to be fully absorbed.

 Villi

 Within the circular folds are small (0.5—1 mm long) hairlike vascularized projections called villi (singular = villus) that give
the mucosa a furry texture.
