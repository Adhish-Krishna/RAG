pressure of oxygen in fetal blood at the placenta is about 20 mm Hg. Therefore, there is not as much diffusion of oxygen
into the fetal blood supply. The fetusâ€™ hemoglobin overcomes this problem by having a greater affinity for oxygen than
maternal hemoglobin (Figure 22.27). Both fetal and adult hemoglobin have four subunits, but two of the subunits of fetal
hemoglobin have a different structure that causes fetal hemoglobin to have a greater affinity for oxygen than does adult
hemoglobin.
