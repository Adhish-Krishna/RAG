21.4 | The Adaptive Immune Response: B-lymphocytes
and Antibodies

 By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 ¢ Explain how B cells mature and how B cell tolerance develops
¢ Discuss how B cells are activated and differentiate into plasma cells

 ¢ Describe the structure of the antibody classes and their functions

Antibodies were the first component of the adaptive immune response to be characterized by scientists working on the
immune system. It was already known that individuals who survived a bacterial infection were immune to re-infection
with the same pathogen. Early microbiologists took serum from an immune patient and mixed it with a fresh culture of the
same type of bacteria, then observed the bacteria under a microscope. The bacteria became clumped in a process called
agglutination. When a different bacterial species was used, the agglutination did not happen. Thus, there was something in
the serum of immune individuals that could specifically bind to and agglutinate bacteria.
