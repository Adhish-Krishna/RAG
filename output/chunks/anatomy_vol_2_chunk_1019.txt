The wave of depolarization
begins in the right atrium, and the impulse spreads across the superior portions of both atria and then down through the
contractile cells. The contractile cells then begin contraction from the superior to the inferior portions of the atria, efficiently
pumping blood into the ventricles.

 Atrioventricular (AV) Node

The atrioventricular (AV) node is a second clump of specialized myocardial conductive cells, located in the inferior
portion of the right atrium within the atrioventricular septum. The septum prevents the impulse from spreading directly to
the ventricles without passing through the AV node. There is a critical pause before the AV node depolarizes and transmits
the impulse to the atrioventricular bundle (see Figure 19.19, step 3). This delay in transmission is partially attributable to
the small diameter of the cells of the node, which slow the impulse. Also, conduction between nodal cells is less efficient
than between conducting cells. These factors mean that it takes the impulse approximately 100 ms to pass through the node.
