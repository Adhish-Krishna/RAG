The anterior (deep) surface of the scapula forms the broad subscapular fossa.
 All of these fossae provide large surface areas for the attachment of muscles that cross the shoulder joint to act on the
humerus.

 The acromioclavicular joint transmits forces from the upper limb to the clavicle. The ligaments around this joint
are relatively weak. A hard fall onto the elbow or outstretched hand can stretch or tear the acromioclavicular ligaments,
resulting in a moderate injury to the joint. However, the primary support for the acromioclavicular joint comes from a very
strong ligament called the coracoclavicular ligament (see Figure 8.3). This connective tissue band anchors the coracoid
process of the scapula to the inferior surface of the acromial end of the clavicle and thus provides important indirect support
for the acromioclavicular joint. Following a strong blow to the lateral shoulder, such as when a hockey player is driven into
the boards, a complete dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint can result.
