As actin
is pulled, the filaments move approximately 10 nm toward the M-line. This movement is called the power stroke, as
movement of the thin filament occurs at this step (Figure 10.11c). In the absence of ATP, the myosin head will not detach
from actin.

 One part of the myosin head attaches to the binding site on the actin, but the head has another binding site for ATP. ATP
binding causes the myosin head to detach from the actin (Figure 10.11d). After this occurs, ATP is converted to ADP and

Pj by the intrinsic ATPase activity of myosin. The energy released during ATP hydrolysis changes the angle of the myosin
head into a cocked position (Figure 10.11e). The myosin head is now in position for further movement.

 When the myosin head is cocked, myosin is in a high-energy configuration.
