Nervous Produces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within choroid plexuses;
contributes to blood-brain barrier; cardiac and vasomotor centers
regulate cardiac output and blood flow through vessels via autonomic
system

Reproductive Aids in erection of genitalia in both sexes during sexual arousal;
transports gonadotropic hormones that regulate reproductive
functions

Provides blood for critical exchange of gases to carry oxygen needed
for metabolic reactions and carbon dioxide generated as byproducts
of these processes

Skeletal Provides calcium, phosphate, and other minerals critical for bone
matrix; transports hormones regulating buildup and absorption of
matrix including growth hormone (somatotropin), thyroid hormone,
calcitonins, and parathyroid hormone; erythropoietin stimulates
myeloid cell hematopoiesis; some level of protection for select
vessels by bony structures

Delivers 20% of resting circulation to kidneys for filtering,
reabsorption of useful products, and secretion of excesses; regulates
blood volume and pressure by regulating fluid loss in the form of
urine and by releasing the enzyme renin that is essential in the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone mechanism

Figure 20.22 Interaction of the Circulatory System with Other Body Systems

As you learn about the vessels of the systemic and pulmonary circuits, notice that many arteries and veins share the
same names, parallel one another throughout the body, and are very similar on the right and left sides of the body.
