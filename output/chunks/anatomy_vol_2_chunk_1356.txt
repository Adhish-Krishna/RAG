NK cells recognize these cells by
mechanisms that are still not well understood, but that presumably involve their surface receptors. NK cells can induce
apoptosis, in which a cascade of events inside the cell causes its own death by either of two mechanisms:

1) NK cells are able to respond to chemical signals and express the fas ligand. The fas ligand is a surface molecule
that binds to the fas molecule on the surface of the infected cell, sending it apoptotic signals, thus killing the cell and the
pathogen within it; or

2) The granules of the NK cells release perforins and granzymes. A perforin is a protein that forms pores in the
membranes of infected cells. A granzyme is a protein-digesting enzyme that enters the cell via the perforin pores and
triggers apoptosis intracellularly.

 Both mechanisms are especially effective against virally infected cells. If apoptosis is induced before the virus has the
ability to synthesize and assemble all its components, no infectious virus will be released from the cell, thus preventing
further infection.
