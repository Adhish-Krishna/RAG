Figure 24.11 Triglyceride Broken Down into a Monoglyceride A triglyceride molecule (a) breaks down into a
monoglyceride (b).

 Lipid metabolism begins in the intestine where ingested triglycerides are broken down into smaller chain fatty acids
and subsequently into monoglyceride molecules (see Figure 24.11b) by pancreatic lipases, enzymes that break down
fats after they are emulsified by bile salts. When food reaches the small intestine in the form of chyme, a digestive
hormone called cholecystokinin (CCK) is released by intestinal cells in the intestinal mucosa.
