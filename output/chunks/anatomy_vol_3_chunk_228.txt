Antacids help relieve symptoms of ulcers such as “burning” pain and indigestion. When ulcers are caused by
NSAID use, switching to other classes of pain relievers allows healing. When caused by H. pylori infection, antibiotics
are effective.

 A potential complication of ulcers is perforation: Perforated ulcers create a hole in the stomach wall, resulting in
peritonitis (inflammation of the peritoneum). These ulcers must be repaired surgically.

 Digestive Functions of the Stomach

The stomach participates in virtually all the digestive activities with the exception of ingestion and defecation. Although
almost all absorption takes place in the small intestine, the stomach does absorb some nonpolar substances, such as alcohol
and aspirin.

 Mechanical Digestion

Within a few moments after food after enters your stomach, mixing waves begin to occur at intervals of approximately 20
seconds. A mixing wave is a unique type of peristalsis that mixes and softens the food with gastric juices to create chyme.
