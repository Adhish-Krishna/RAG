In the fully extended knee position,
both collateral ligaments are taut (tight), thus serving to stabilize and support the extended knee and preventing side-to-side
or rotational motions between the femur and tibia.

 The articular capsule of the posterior knee is thickened by intrinsic ligaments that help to resist knee hyperextension.
 Inside the knee are two intracapsular ligaments, the anterior cruciate ligament and posterior cruciate ligament. These
ligaments are anchored inferiorly to the tibia at the intercondylar eminence, the roughened area between the tibial condyles.
 The cruciate ligaments are named for whether they are attached anteriorly or posteriorly to this tibial region. Each ligament
runs diagonally upward to attach to the inner aspect of a femoral condyle. The cruciate ligaments are named for the X-shape
formed as they pass each other (cruciate means “cross”). The posterior cruciate ligament is the stronger ligament. It serves
