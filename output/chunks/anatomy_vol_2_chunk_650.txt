The name of the pons
is derived from its connection to the cerebellum. The word means “bridge” and refers to the thick bundle of myelinated
axons that form a bulge on its ventral surface. Those fibers are axons that project from the gray matter of the pons into the
contralateral cerebellar cortex. These fibers make up the middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) and are the major physical
connection of the cerebellum to the brain stem (Figure 16.14). Two other white matter bundles connect the cerebellum to
the other regions of the brain stem. The superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP) is the connection of the cerebellum to the
midbrain and forebrain. The inferior cerebellar peduncle (ICP) is the connection to the medulla.
