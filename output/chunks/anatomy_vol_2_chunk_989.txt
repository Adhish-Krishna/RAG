Visit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/heartvalve) to observe an echocardiogram of actual heart valves opening
and closing. Although much of the heart has been “removed” from this gif loop so the chordae tendineae are not visible,

why is their presence more critical for the atrioventricular valves (tricuspid and mitral) than the semilunar (aortic and
pulmonary) valves?

Heart Valves

When heart valves do not function properly, they are often described as incompetent and result in valvular heart
disease, which can range from benign to lethal. Some of these conditions are congenital, that is, the individual was
born with the defect, whereas others may be attributed to disease processes or trauma. Some malfunctions are treated
with medications, others require surgery, and still others may be mild enough that the condition is merely monitored
since treatment might trigger more serious consequences.
