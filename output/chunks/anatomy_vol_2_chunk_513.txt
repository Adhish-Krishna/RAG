For example,
the sympathetic system will cause sphincters in the digestive tract to contract, limiting digestive propulsion, but the
parasympathetic system will cause the contraction of other muscles in the digestive tract, which will try to push the contents
of the digestive system along. The end result is that the food does not really move along and the digestive system has not
appreciably changed.

 The system in which this can be problematic is in the cardiovascular system, which is why smoking is a risk factor for
cardiovascular disease. First, there is no significant parasympathetic regulation of blood pressure. Only a limited number of
blood vessels are affected by parasympathetic input, so nicotine will preferentially cause the vascular tone to become more
sympathetic, which means blood pressure will be increased. Second, the autonomic control of the heart is special. Unlike
skeletal or smooth muscles, cardiac muscle is intrinsically active, meaning that it generates its own action potentials.
