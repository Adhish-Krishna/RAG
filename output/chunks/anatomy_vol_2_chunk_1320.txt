Of this, 17 liters is reabsorbed directly by the blood vessels. But what happens to the remaining three liters? This
is where the lymphatic system comes into play. It drains the excess fluid and empties it back into the bloodstream via a
series of vessels, trunks, and ducts. Lymph is the term used to describe interstitial fluid once it has entered the lymphatic
system. When the lymphatic system is damaged in some way, such as by being blocked by cancer cells or destroyed by
injury, protein-rich interstitial fluid accumulates (sometimes “backs up” from the lymph vessels) in the tissue spaces. This
inappropriate accumulation of fluid referred to as lymphedema may lead to serious medical consequences.

 As the vertebrate immune system evolved, the network of lymphatic vessels became convenient avenues for
transporting the cells of the immune system. Additionally, the transport of dietary lipids and fat-soluble vitamins absorbed
in the gut uses this system.
