The descending and ascending loop and vasa

recta form a countercurrent multiplier system to increase Naâ€™ concentration in the kidney medulla. The collecting ducts
actively pump urea into the medulla, further contributing to the high osmotic environment. The vasa recta recover the solute
and water in the medulla, returning them to the circulation. Nearly 90 percent of water is recovered before the forming urine

reaches the DCT, which will recover another 10 percent. Calcium recovery in the DCT is influenced by PTH and active
vitamin D. In the collecting ducts, ADH stimulates aquaporin channel insertion to increase water recovery and thereby

regulate osmolarity of the blood. Aldosterone stimulates Na* recovery by the collecting duct.
 25.7 Regulation of Renal Blood Flow

The kidneys are innervated by sympathetic nerves of the autonomic nervous system. Sympathetic nervous activity decreases
blood flow to the kidney, making more blood available to other areas of the body during times of stress.
