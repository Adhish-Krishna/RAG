The outer layer of the embryo, the ectoderm,
gives rise to the skin and the nervous system. A specialized region of this layer, the neuroectoderm, becomes a groove that
folds in and becomes the neural tube beneath the dorsal surface of the embryo. The anterior end of the neural tube develops
into the brain, and the posterior region becomes the spinal cord. Tissues at the edges of the neural groove, when it closes
off, are called the neural crest and migrate through the embryo to give rise to PNS structures as well as some non-nervous
tissues.
 The brain develops from this early tube structure and gives rise to specific regions of the adult brain. As the neural tube
grows and differentiates, it enlarges into three vesicles that correspond to the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain regions
the adult brain. Later in development, two of these three vesicles differentiate further, resulting in five vesicles. Those
five vesicles can be aligned with the four major regions of the adult brain.
