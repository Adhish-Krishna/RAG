An example of an autosomal dominant
disorder is neurofibromatosis type I, a disease that induces tumor formation within the nervous system that leads to skin
and skeletal deformities. Consider a couple in which one parent is heterozygous for this disorder (and who therefore has
neurofibromatosis), Nn, and one parent is homozygous for the normal gene, nn. The heterozygous parent would have a 50
percent chance of passing the dominant allele for this disorder to his or her offspring, and the homozygous parent would
always pass the normal allele. Therefore, four possible offspring genotypes are equally likely to occur: Nn, Nn, nn, and
nn. That is, every child of this couple would have a 50 percent chance of inheriting neurofibromatosis. This inheritance
pattern is shown in Figure 28.26, in a form called a Punnett square, named after its creator, the British geneticist Reginald
Punnett.
