The neural crest
migrates away from the nascent, or embryonic, central nervous system (CNS) that will form along the neural groove and
develops into several parts of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), including the enteric nervous tissue. Many tissues that
are not part of the nervous system also arise from the neural crest, such as craniofacial cartilage and bone, and melanocytes.
