They are components of all four types of organic
Hydroxyl —O—H compounds discussed in this chapter. They are involved in dehydration
synthesis and hydrolysis reactions.

 Carboxyl groups are found within fatty acids, amino acids, and many other

Carboxyl O—C—OH acids.

 Amino —N—H2 Amino groups are found within amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.
 Methyl —C—H3 Methyl groups are found within amino acids.

 Phosphate —P—022- Phosphate groups are found within phospholipids and nucleotides.

 Table 2.1

Carbon’s affinity for covalent bonding means that many distinct and relatively stable organic molecules nevertheless
readily form larger, more complex molecules. Any large molecule is referred to as macromolecule (macro- = “large”),
and the organic compounds in this section all fit this description. However, some macromolecules are made up of several
“copies” of single units called monomer (mono- = “one”; -mer = “part”).
