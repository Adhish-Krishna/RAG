By having the subject
perform a visual task, activity all over the brain can be measured. Consider this possible experiment: the subject is told
to look at a screen with a black dot in the middle (a fixation point). A photograph of a face is projected on the screen
away from the center. The subject has to look at the photograph and decipher what it is. The subject has been instructed
to push a button if the photograph is of someone they recognize. The photograph might be of a celebrity, so the subject
would press the button, or it might be of a random person unknown to the subject, so the subject would not press the
button.

 In this task, visual sensory areas would be active, integrating areas would be active, motor areas responsible for
moving the eyes would be active, and motor areas for pressing the button with a finger would be active.
