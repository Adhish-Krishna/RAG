For example, most of the joints of the skull are held together by fibrous connective tissue and do not allow for movement
between the adjacent bones. This lack of mobility is important, because the skull bones serve to protect the brain. Similarly,
other joints united by fibrous connective tissue allow for very little movement, which provides stability and weight-bearing
support for the body. For example, the tibia and fibula of the leg are tightly united to give stability to the body when
standing. At other joints, the bones are held together by cartilage, which permits limited movements between the bones.
 Thus, the joints of the vertebral column only allow for small movements between adjacent vertebrae, but when added
together, these movements provide the flexibility that allows your body to twist, or bend to the front, back, or side.
