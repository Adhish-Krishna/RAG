When the sweat evaporates from the skin surface, the body is cooled as body heat is
dissipated.

 In addition to sweating, arterioles in the dermis dilate so that excess heat carried by the blood can dissipate through the
skin and into the surrounding environment (Figure 5.16b). This accounts for the skin redness that many people experience
when exercising.
