The thyroid cartilage is the largest piece of cartilage that makes up the
larynx. The thyroid cartilage consists of the laryngeal prominence, or “Adam’s apple,” which tends to be more prominent
in males. The thick cricoid cartilage forms a ring, with a wide posterior region and a thinner anterior region. Three smaller,
paired cartilages—the arytenoids, corniculates, and cuneiforms—attach to the epiglottis and the vocal cords and muscle that
help move the vocal cords to produce speech.
