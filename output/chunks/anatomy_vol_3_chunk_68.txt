The normal respiratory rate of a child decreases from birth to adolescence. A child under 1 year of age has a normal
respiratory rate between 30 and 60 breaths per minute, but by the time a child is about 10 years old, the normal rate is closer
to 18 to 30. By adolescence, the normal respiratory rate is similar to that of adults, 12 to 18 breaths per minute.

 Ventilation Control Centers

The control of ventilation is a complex interplay of multiple regions in the brain that signal the muscles used in pulmonary
ventilation to contract (Table 22.1). The result is typically a rhythmic, consistent ventilation rate that provides the body with
sufficient amounts of oxygen, while adequately removing carbon dioxide.

 Summary of Ventilation Regulation
System component Function

Medullary respiratory renter _| Sets the basic rhythm of breathing

Ventral respiratory group Generates the breathing rhythm and integrates data coming into the medulla

(VRG)
Dorsal respiratory group Integrates input from the stretch receptors and the chemoreceptors in the
(DRG) periphery

Pontine respiratory group Influences and modifies the medulla oblongataâ€™s functions

(PRG)

Aortic body Monitors blood PCO2, PO2, and pH

Carotid body Monitors blood PCO2, PO2, and pH
Hypothalamus Monitors emotional state and body temperature

Neurons that innervate the muscles of the respiratory system are responsible for controlling and regulating pulmonary
ventilation.
