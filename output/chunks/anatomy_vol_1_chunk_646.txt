Important landmarks of the temporal bone, as shown in Figure 7.8, include the following:

¢ External acoustic meatus (ear canal)—This is the large opening on the lateral side of the skull that is associated with
the ear.

 ¢ Internal acoustic meatus—This opening is located inside the cranial cavity, on the medial side of the petrous ridge.
 It connects to the middle and inner ear cavities of the temporal bone.

 * Mandibular fossa—This is the deep, oval-shaped depression located on the external base of the skull, just in
front of the external acoustic meatus. The mandible (lower jaw) joins with the skull at this site as part of the
temporomandibular joint, which allows for movements of the mandible during opening and closing of the mouth.

 ¢ Articular tubercle—The smooth ridge located immediately anterior to the mandibular fossa. Both the articular
tubercle and mandibular fossa contribute to the temporomandibular joint, the joint that provides for movements
between the temporal bone of the skull and the mandible.
