The dura also surrounds and supports the venous sinuses.

 Arachnoid Mater

The middle layer of the meninges is the arachnoid, named for the spider-web-like trabeculae between it and the pia mater.
 The arachnoid defines a sac-like enclosure around the CNS. The trabeculae are found in the subarachnoid space, which is
filled with circulating CSF. The arachnoid emerges into the dural sinuses as the arachnoid granulations, where the CSF is
filtered back into the blood for drainage from the nervous system.

 The subarachnoid space is filled with circulating CSF, which also provides a liquid cushion to the brain and spinal
cord. Similar to clinical blood work, a sample of CSF can be withdrawn to find chemical evidence of neuropathology or
metabolic traces of the biochemical functions of nervous tissue.

 Pia Mater

The outer surface of the CNS is covered in the thin fibrous membrane of the pia mater. It is thought to have a continuous
layer of cells providing a fluid-impermeable membrane.
