During the normal hormonal fluctuations in the menstrual cycle, breast tissue responds to changing levels of estrogen
and progesterone, which can lead to swelling and breast tenderness in some individuals, especially during the secretory
phase. If pregnancy occurs, the increase in hormones leads to further development of the mammary tissue and enlargement
of the breasts.

 Hormonal Birth Control

Birth control pills take advantage of the negative feedback system that regulates the ovarian and menstrual cycles to stop
ovulation and prevent pregnancy. Typically they work by providing a constant level of both estrogen and progesterone,
which negatively feeds back onto the hypothalamus and pituitary, thus preventing the release of FSH and LH. Without FSH,
the follicles do not mature, and without the LH surge, ovulation does not occur. Although the estrogen in birth control pills
does stimulate some thickening of the endometrial wall, it is reduced compared with a normal cycle and is less likely to
support implantation.
