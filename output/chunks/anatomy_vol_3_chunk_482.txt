These
cells are not as active as those in the PCT; thus, there are fewer microvilli on the apical surface. However, these cells must
also pump ions against their concentration gradient, so you will find of large numbers of mitochondria, although fewer than
in the PCT.

 Collecting Ducts

The collecting ducts are continuous with the nephron but not technically part of it. In fact, each duct collects filtrate from
several nephrons for final modification. Collecting ducts merge as they descend deeper in the medulla to form about 30
terminal ducts, which empty at a papilla. They are lined with simple squamous epithelium with receptors for ADH. When
stimulated by ADH, these cells will insert aquaporin channel proteins into their membranes, which as their name suggests,
allow water to pass from the duct lumen through the cells and into the interstitial spaces to be recovered by the vasa recta.
