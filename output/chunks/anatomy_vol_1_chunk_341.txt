Telophase is the final stage of mitosis. Telophase is characterized by the formation of two new daughter nuclei at either
end of the dividing cell. These newly formed nuclei surround the genetic material, which uncoils such that the chromosomes
return to loosely packed chromatin. Nucleoli also reappear within the new nuclei, and the mitotic spindle breaks apart, each
new cell receiving its own complement of DNA, organelles, membranes, and centrioles. At this point, the cell is already
beginning to split in half as cytokinesis begins.

 The cleavage furrow is a contractile band made up of microfilaments that forms around the midline of the cell during
cytokinesis. (Recall that microfilaments consist of actin.) This contractile band squeezes the two cells apart until they finally
separate. Two new cells are now formed. One of these cells (the “stem cell”) enters its own cell cycle; able to grow and
divide again at some future time.
