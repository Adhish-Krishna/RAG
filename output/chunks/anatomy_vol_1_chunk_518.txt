Although many tumors are benign
(harmless), some produce cells that can mobilize and establish tumors in other organs of the body; this process is referred
to as metastasis. Cancers are characterized by their ability to metastasize.

 Basal Cell Carcinoma

Basal cell carcinoma is a form of cancer that affects the mitotically active stem cells in the stratum basale of the epidermis.
 It is the most common of all cancers that occur in the United States and is frequently found on the head, neck, arms, and
back, which are areas that are most susceptible to long-term sun exposure. Although UV rays are the main culprit, exposure
to other agents, such as radiation and arsenic, can also lead to this type of cancer. Wounds on the skin due to open sores,
tattoos, burns, etc. may be predisposing factors as well. Basal cell carcinomas start in the stratum basale and usually spread
along this boundary.
