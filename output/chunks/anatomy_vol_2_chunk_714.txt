Bisphenol A and Endocrine Disruption

You may have heard news reports about the effects of a chemical called bisphenol A (BPA) in various types of food
packaging. BPA is used in the manufacturing of hard plastics and epoxy resins. Common food-related items that may
contain BPA include the lining of aluminum cans, plastic food-storage containers, drinking cups, as well as baby bottles
and “sippy” cups. Other uses of BPA include medical equipment, dental fillings, and the lining of water pipes.
 Research suggests that BPA is an endocrine disruptor, meaning that it negatively interferes with the endocrine
system, particularly during the prenatal and postnatal development period.
