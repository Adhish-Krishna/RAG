* Glycogen is also a polymer of glucose, but it is stored in the tissues of animals, especially in the muscles and liver. It is
not considered a dietary carbohydrate because very little glycogen remains in animal tissues after slaughter; however,
the human body stores excess glucose as glycogen, again, in the muscles and liver.

 * Cellulose, a polysaccharide that is the primary component of the cell wall of green plants, is the component of plant
food referred to as “fiber”. In humans, cellulose/fiber is not digestible; however, dietary fiber has many health benefits.
 It helps you feel full so you eat less, it promotes a healthy digestive tract, and a diet high in fiber is thought to reduce
the risk of heart disease and possibly some forms of cancer.
