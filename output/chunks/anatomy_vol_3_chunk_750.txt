For proper reproductive function in the adult, one set of these
ducts must develop properly, and the other must degrade. In males, secretions from sustentacular cells trigger a degradation
of the female duct, called the Miillerian duct. At the same time, testosterone secretion stimulates growth of the male
tract, the Wolffian duct. Without such sustentacular cell secretion, the Miillerian duct will develop; without testosterone,
the Wolffian duct will degrade. Thus, the developing offspring will be female. For more information and a figure of
differentiation of the gonads, seek additional content on fetal development.

 A babyâ€™s gender is determined at conception, and the different genitalia of male and female fetuses develop from
the same tissues in the embryo. View this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/fetus) to see a comparison of the
development of structures of the female and male reproductive systems in a growing fetus. Where are the testes located
for most of gestational time?

Further Sexual Development Occurs at Puberty

Puberty is the stage of development at which individuals become sexually mature.
