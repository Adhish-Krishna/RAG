By the time this process is complete,
the body will have large numbers of specific lymphocytes available to fight the infection (see Figure 21.19).

 The Cellular Basis of Immunological Memory

As already discussed, one of the major features of an adaptive immune response is the development of immunological
memory.

 During a primary adaptive immune response, both memory T cells and effector T cells are generated. Memory T cells
are long-lived and can even persist for a lifetime. Memory cells are primed to act rapidly. Thus, any subsequent exposure

to the pathogen will elicit a very rapid T cell response. This rapid, secondary adaptive response generates large numbers of
effector T cells so fast that the pathogen is often overwhelmed before it can cause any symptoms of disease.
