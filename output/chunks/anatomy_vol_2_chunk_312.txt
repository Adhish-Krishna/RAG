When you eat something salty, the salt crystals

dissociate into the component ions Na* and CI, which dissolve into the saliva in your mouth. The Na” concentration
becomes high outside the gustatory cells, creating a strong concentration gradient that drives the diffusion of the ion into the

cells. The entry of Na” into these cells results in the depolarization of the cell membrane and the generation of a receptor
potential.

 Sour taste is the perception of H® concentration. Just as with sodium ions in salty flavors, these hydrogen ions enter
the cell and trigger depolarization. Sour flavors are, essentially, the perception of acids in our food. Increasing hydrogen ion
concentrations in the saliva (lowering saliva pH) triggers progressively stronger graded potentials in the gustatory cells. For
example, orange juice—which contains citric acid—will taste sour because it has a pH value of approximately 3.
