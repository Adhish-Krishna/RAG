In contrast, sensory information can also be
processed by deeper brain regions, which we may vaguely describe as subconsciousâ€”for instance, we are not constantly
aware of the proprioceptive information that the cerebellum uses to maintain balance. Several of the subtests can reveal
activity associated with these sensory modalities, such as being able to hear a question or see a picture. Two subtests assess
specific functions of these cortical areas.
 The first is praxis, a practical exercise in which the patient performs a task completely on the basis of verbal
description without any demonstration from the examiner. For example, the patient can be told to take their left hand and
place it palm down on their left thigh, then flip it over so the palm is facing up, and then repeat this four times. The
examiner describes the activity without any movements on their part to suggest how the movements are to be performed.
