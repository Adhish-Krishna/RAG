CHAPTER 24 | METABOLISM AND NUTRITION 1111

Starvation

When the body is deprived of nourishment for an extended period of time, it goes into “survival mode.” The first priority
for survival is to provide enough glucose or fuel for the brain. The second priority is the conservation of amino acids for
proteins. Therefore, the body uses ketones to satisfy the energy needs of the brain and other glucose-dependent organs, and
to maintain proteins in the cells (see Figure 24.2).
