* Describe the pathways important to descending control of the autonomic system

The pupillary light reflex (Figure 15.10) begins when light hits the retina and causes a signal to travel along the optic nerve.
 This is visual sensation, because the afferent branch of this reflex is simply sharing the special sense pathway. Bright light
hitting the retina leads to the parasympathetic response, through the oculomotor nerve, followed by the postganglionic fiber
from the ciliary ganglion, which stimulates the circular fibers of the iris to contract and constrict the pupil.
