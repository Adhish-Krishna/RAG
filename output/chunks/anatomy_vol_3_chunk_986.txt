47 Single-unit smooth muscle is found in the walls of hollow organs; multiunit smooth muscle
is found in airways to the lungs and large arteries. Single-unit smooth muscle cells contract synchronously, they are coupled by
gap junctions, and they exhibit spontaneous action potential. Multiunit smooth cells lack gap junctions, and their contractions are
not synchronous. 48 If the damage exceeds what can be repaired by satellite cells, the damaged tissue is replaced by scar tissue,
which cannot contract. 49 Smooth muscle tissue can regenerate from stem cells called pericytes, cells found in some small blood
vessels. These allow smooth muscle cells to regenerate and repair much more readily than skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue.
