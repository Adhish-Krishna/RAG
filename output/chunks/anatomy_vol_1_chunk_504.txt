In addition to water and salts, apocrine sweat
includes organic compounds that make the sweat thicker and subject to bacterial decomposition and subsequent smell.
 The release of this sweat is under both nervous and hormonal control, and plays a role in the poorly understood human
pheromone response. Most commercial antiperspirants use an aluminum-based compound as their primary active ingredient
to stop sweat. When the antiperspirant enters the sweat gland duct, the aluminum-based compounds precipitate due to a
change in pH and form a physical block in the duct, which prevents sweat from coming out of the pore.

Sweating regulates body temperature. The composition of the sweat determines whether body odor is a byproduct of
sweating. Visit this link (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/sweating) to learn more about sweating and body odor.
