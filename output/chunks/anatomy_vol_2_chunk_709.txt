process allows cells to be more sensitive to the hormone that is present. Cells can also alter the sensitivity of the receptors
themselves to various hormones.

 Two or more hormones can interact to affect the response of cells in a variety of ways. The three most common types
of interaction are as follows:

* The permissive effect, in which the presence of one hormone enables another hormone to act. For example, thyroid
hormones have complex permissive relationships with certain reproductive hormones. A dietary deficiency of iodine,
a component of thyroid hormones, can therefore affect reproductive system development and functioning.

 * The synergistic effect, in which two hormones with similar effects produce an amplified response. In some cases, two
hormones are required for an adequate response. For example, two different reproductive hormones—FSH from the
pituitary gland and estrogens from the ovaries—are required for the maturation of female ova (egg cells).
