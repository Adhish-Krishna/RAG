The molecule of mRNA provides the code to synthesize a protein. In the process of translation, the mRNA attaches to
a ribosome. Next, tRNA molecules shuttle the appropriate amino acids to the ribosome, one-by-one, coded by sequential

triplet codons on the mRNA, until the protein is fully synthesized. When completed, the mRNA detaches from the ribosome,
and the protein is released. Typically, multiple ribosomes attach to a single mRNA molecule at once such that multiple
proteins can be manufactured from the mRNA concurrently.

 3.5 Cell Growth and Division

The life of cell consists of stages that make up the cell cycle. After a cell is born, it passes through an interphase before it
is ready to replicate itself and produce daughter cells. This interphase includes two gap phases (G1 and G2), as well as an
S phase, during which its DNA is replicated in preparation for cell division.
