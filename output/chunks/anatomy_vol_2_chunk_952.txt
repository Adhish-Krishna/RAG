Chambers and Circulation through the Heart

The human heart consists of four chambers: The left side and the right side each have one atrium and one ventricle. Each
of the upper chambers, the right atrium (plural = atria) and the left atrium, acts as a receiving chamber and contracts to
push blood into the lower chambers, the right ventricle and the left ventricle. The ventricles serve as the primary pumping
chambers of the heart, propelling blood to the lungs or to the rest of the body.
 There are two distinct but linked circuits in the human circulation called the pulmonary and systemic circuits. Although
both circuits transport blood and everything it carries, we can initially view the circuits from the point of view of gases.
 The pulmonary circuit transports blood to and from the lungs, where it picks up oxygen and delivers carbon dioxide for
exhalation. The systemic circuit transports oxygenated blood to virtually all of the tissues of the body and returns relatively
deoxygenated blood and carbon dioxide to the heart to be sent back to the pulmonary circulation.
