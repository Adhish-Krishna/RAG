In contrast, the deep socket of the
acetabulum and the strong supporting ligaments of the hip joint serve to constrain movements of the femur, reflecting the
need for stability and weight-bearing ability at the hip.

Ag ng AND THE...

Joints

Arthritis is a common disorder of synovial joints that involves inflammation of the joint. This often results in
significant joint pain, along with swelling, stiffness, and reduced joint mobility. There are more than 100 different
forms of arthritis. Arthritis may arise from aging, damage to the articular cartilage, autoimmune diseases, bacterial or
viral infections, or unknown (probably genetic) causes.

 The most common type of arthritis is osteoarthritis, which is associated with aging and “wear and tear” of the
articular cartilage (Figure 9.11).
