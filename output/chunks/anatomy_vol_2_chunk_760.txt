If the stress continues for a longer term however, the body responds with symptoms quite different than the fight-
or-flight response. During the stage of exhaustion, individuals may begin to suffer depression, the suppression of their
immune response, severe fatigue, or even a fatal heart attack. These symptoms are mediated by the hormones of the adrenal
cortex, especially cortisol, released as a result of signals from the HPA axis.

 Adrenal hormones also have several non-stress-related functions, including the increase of blood sodium and glucose
levels, which will be described in detail below.

 Adrenal Cortex

The adrenal cortex consists of multiple layers of lipid-storing cells that occur in three structurally distinct regions. Each of
these regions produces different hormones.

of the adrenal glands. Which hormone produced by the adrenal glands is responsible for the mobilization of energy
stores?

Hormones of the Zona Glomerulosa

The most superficial region of the adrenal cortex is the zona glomerulosa, which produces a group of hormones collectively
referred to as mineralocorticoids because of their effect on body minerals, especially sodium and potassium.
