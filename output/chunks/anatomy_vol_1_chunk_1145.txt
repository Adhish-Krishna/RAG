The axial
muscles are grouped based on location, function, or both. Some of the axial muscles may seem to blur the boundaries
because they cross over to the appendicular skeleton. The first grouping of the axial muscles you will review includes the
muscles of the head and neck, then you will review the muscles of the vertebral column, and finally you will review the
oblique and rectus muscles.

 Muscles That Create Facial Expression

The origins of the muscles of facial expression are on the surface of the skull (remember, the origin of a muscle does not
move). The insertions of these muscles have fibers intertwined with connective tissue and the dermis of the skin. Because
the muscles insert in the skin rather than on bone, when they contract, the skin moves to create facial expression (Figure
11.7).

Figure 11.7 Muscles of Facial Expression Many of the muscles of facial expression insert into the skin surrounding
the eyelids, nose and mouth, producing facial expressions by moving the skin rather than bones.
