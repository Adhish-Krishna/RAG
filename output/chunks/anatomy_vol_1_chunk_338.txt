identical genetic material into two new nuclei, followed by the division of the cytoplasm.

116 CHAPTER 3| THE CELLULAR LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION

Prophase is the first phase of mitosis, during which the loosely packed chromatin coils and condenses into visible
chromosomes. During prophase, each chromosome becomes visible with its identical partner attached, forming the familiar
X-shape of sister chromatids. The nucleolus disappears early during this phase, and the nuclear envelope also disintegrates.

 A major occurrence during prophase concerns a very important structure that contains the origin site for microtubule
growth. Recall the cellular structures called centrioles that serve as origin points from which microtubules extend.
