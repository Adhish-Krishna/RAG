This region will become the hand or foot. The wrist or ankle areas then appear as a constriction that develops
at the base of the paddle. Shortly after this, a second constriction on the limb bud appears at the future site of the elbow
or knee. Within the paddle, areas of tissue undergo cell death, producing separations between the growing fingers and toes.
 Also during the sixth week of development, mesenchyme within the limb buds begins to differentiate into hyaline cartilage
that will form models of the future limb bones.
 The early outgrowth of the upper and lower limb buds initially has the limbs positioned so that the regions that will
become the palm of the hand or the bottom of the foot are facing medially toward the body, with the future thumb or big toe
both oriented toward the head.
