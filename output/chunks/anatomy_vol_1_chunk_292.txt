 Figure 3.15 Golgi Apparatus (a) The Golgi apparatus manipulates products from the rough ER, and also produces
new organelles called lysosomes. Proteins and other products of the ER are sent to the Golgi apparatus, which
organizes, modifies, packages, and tags them. Some of these products are transported to other areas of the cell and
some are exported from the cell through exocytosis. Enzymatic proteins are packaged as new lysosomes (or packaged
and sent for fusion with existing lysosomes). (b) An electron micrograph of the Golgi apparatus.

 Lysosomes

Some of the protein products packaged by the Golgi include digestive enzymes that are meant to remain inside the cell for
use in breaking down certain materials. The enzyme-containing vesicles released by the Golgi may form new lysosomes,
or fuse with existing, lysosomes.
