Reproductive development continues in utero, but there is little change
in the reproductive system between infancy and puberty.

 Development of the Sexual Organs in the Embryo and Fetus

Females are considered the “fundamental” sex—that is, without much chemical prompting, all fertilized eggs would
develop into females. To become a male, an individual must be exposed to the cascade of factors initiated by a single gene
on the male Y chromosome. This is called the SRY (Sex-determining Region of the Y chromosome). Because females do
not have a Y chromosome, they do not have the SRY gene. Without a functional SRY gene, an individual will be female.

 In both male and female embryos, the same group of cells has the potential to develop into either the male or female
gonads; this tissue is considered bipotential. The SRY gene actively recruits other genes that begin to develop the testes,
and suppresses genes that are important in female development.
