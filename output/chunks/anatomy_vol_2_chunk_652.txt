The SCP is the major output of the cerebellum, divided between the red nucleus in the midbrain and the thalamus,
which will return cerebellar processing to the motor cortex. These connections describe a circuit that compares motor
commands and sensory feedback to generate a new output. These comparisons make it possible to coordinate movements.
 If the cerebral cortex sends a motor command to initiate walking, that command is copied by the pons and sent into the
cerebellum through the MCP. Sensory feedback in the form of proprioception from the spinal cord, as well as vestibular
sensations from the inner ear, enters through the ICP. If you take a step and begin to slip on the floor because it is wet, the
output from the cerebellum—through the SCP—can correct for that and keep you balanced and moving. The red nucleus
sends new motor commands to the spinal cord through the rubrospinal tract.

 The cerebellum is divided into regions that are based on the particular functions and connections involved.
