This video gives an abbreviated
overview of the visual system by concentrating on the
pathway from the eyes to the occipital lobe. The video
makes the statement (at 0:45) that “specialized cells in the
retina called ganglion cells convert the light rays into
electrical signals.” What aspect of retinal processing is
simplified by that statement? Explain your answer.

6. Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/I_3-D1)
to learn more about how the brain perceives 3-D motion.
 Similar to how retinal disparity offers 3-D moviegoers a
way to extract 3-D information from the two-dimensional
visual field projected onto the retina, the brain can extract
information about movement in space by comparing what
the two eyes see. If movement of a visual stimulus is
leftward in one eye and rightward in the opposite eye, the
brain interprets this as movement toward (or away) from the
face along the midline.
