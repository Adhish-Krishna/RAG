syndrome, which is characterized by pain or numbness, and muscle weakness in those areas of the hand supplied by this
nerve.

Nerve

Figure 8.9 Carpal Tunnel The carpal tunnel is the passageway by which nine muscle tendons and a major nerve
enter the hand from the anterior forearm. The walls and floor of the carpal tunnel are formed by the U-shaped grouping
of the carpal bones, and the roof is formed by the flexor retinaculum, a strong ligament that anteriorly unites the bones.

 Metacarpal Bones

The palm of the hand contains five elongated metacarpal bones. These bones lie between the carpal bones of the wrist and
the bones of the fingers and thumb (see Figure 8.7).
