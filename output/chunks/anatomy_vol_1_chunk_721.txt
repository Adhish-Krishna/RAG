The thoracic cage is formed by the (a) sternum and (b) 12 pairs of ribs with their costal
cartilages. The ribs are anchored posteriorly to the 12 thoracic vertebrae. The sternum consists of the manubrium,
body, and xiphoid process. The ribs are classified as true ribs (1-7) and false ribs (8-12). The last two pairs of false
ribs are also known as floating ribs (11-12).

Sternum

The sternum is the elongated bony structure that anchors the anterior thoracic cage. It consists of three parts: the manubrium,
body, and xiphoid process. The manubrium is the wider, superior portion of the sternum. The top of the manubrium has
a shallow, U-shaped border called the jugular (suprasternal) notch. This can be easily felt at the anterior base of the
neck, between the medial ends of the clavicles.
