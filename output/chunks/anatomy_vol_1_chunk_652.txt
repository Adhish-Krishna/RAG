Inside the cranial cavity, the right
and left lesser wings of the sphenoid bone, which resemble the wings of a flying bird, form the lip of a prominent ridge
that marks the boundary between the anterior and middle cranial fossae. The sella turcica (“Turkish saddle”) is located at
the midline of the middle cranial fossa. This bony region of the sphenoid bone is named for its resemblance to the horse
saddles used by the Ottoman Turks, with a high back and a tall front. The rounded depression in the floor of the sella turcica
is the hypophyseal (pituitary) fossa, which houses the pea-sized pituitary (hypophyseal) gland. The greater wings of the
sphenoid bone extend laterally to either side away from the sella turcica, where they form the anterior floor of the middle
cranial fossa. The greater wing is best seen on the outside of the lateral skull, where it forms a rectangular area immediately
anterior to the squamous portion of the temporal bone.
