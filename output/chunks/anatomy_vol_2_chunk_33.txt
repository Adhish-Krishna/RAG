It is an interesting conundrum to consider that the complexity of the
nervous system may be too complex for it (that is, for us) to completely unravel. But our current level of understanding is
probably nowhere close to that limit.

 One easy way to begin to understand the structure of the nervous system is to start with the large divisions and work
through to a more in-depth understanding. In other chapters, the finer details of the nervous system will be explained, but
first looking at an overview of the system will allow you to begin to understand how its parts work together. The focus of
this chapter is on nervous (neural) tissue, both its structure and its function. But before you learn about that, you will see a
big picture of the system—actually, a few big pictures.
