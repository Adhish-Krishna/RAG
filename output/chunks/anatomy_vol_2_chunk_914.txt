¢ As the erythrocyte clumps are degraded, in a process called hemolysis, their hemoglobin is released into the
bloodstream. This hemoglobin travels to the kidneys, which are responsible for filtration of the blood. However, the
load of hemoglobin released can easily overwhelm the kidney’s capacity to clear it, and the patient can quickly develop
kidney failure.

More than 50 antigens have been identified on erythrocyte membranes, but the most significant in terms of their

potential harm to patients are classified in two groups: the ABO blood group and the Rh blood group.

 The ABO Blood Group

 Although the ABO blood group name consists of three letters, ABO blood typing designates the presence or absence of just
two antigens, A and B. Both are glycoproteins. People whose erythrocytes have A antigens on their erythrocyte membrane
surfaces are designated blood type A, and those whose erythrocytes have B antigens are blood type B. People can also have
both A and B antigens on their erythrocytes, in which case they are blood type AB.
