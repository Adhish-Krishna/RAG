The Six Levels of Organization

To study the chemical level of organization, scientists consider the simplest building blocks of matter: atoms and molecules.
 All matter in the universe is composed of one or more unique pure substances called elements, familiar examples of which
are hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, calcium, and iron. The smallest unit of any of these pure substances (elements) is
an atom. Two or more atoms combine to form a molecule, such as the water molecules, proteins, and sugars found in living
things. Molecules are the chemical building blocks of all body structures.

 A cell is the smallest independently functioning unit of a living organism. Even bacteria, which are extremely small,
independently-living organisms, have a cellular structure. Each bacterium is a single cell. All living structures of human
anatomy contain cells, and almost all functions of human physiology are performed in cells or are initiated by cells.
