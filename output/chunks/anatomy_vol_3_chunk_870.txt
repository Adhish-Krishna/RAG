Describe how alleles determine a person’s traits
¢ Summarize Mendel’s experiments and relate them to human genetics
¢ Explain the inheritance of autosomal dominant and recessive and sex-linked genetic disorders

We have discussed the events that lead to the development of a newborn. But what makes each newborn unique? The answer
lies, of course, in the DNA in the sperm and oocyte that combined to produce that first diploid cell, the human zygote.

1272 CHAPTER 28 | DEVELOPMENT AND INHERITANCE

From Genotype to Phenotype

Each human body cell has a full complement of DNA stored in 23 pairs of chromosomes. Figure 28.24 shows the pairs
in a systematic arrangement called a karyotype. Among these is one pair of chromosomes, called the sex chromosomes,
that determines the sex of the individual (XX in females, XY in males). The remaining 22 chromosome pairs are called
autosomal chromosomes. Each of these chromosomes carries hundreds or even thousands of genes, each of which codes
for the assembly of a particular protein—that is, genes are “expressed” as proteins.
