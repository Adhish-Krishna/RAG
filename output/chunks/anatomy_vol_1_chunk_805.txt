The three areas of each hip bone, the ilium, pubis, and ischium, converge centrally to form a deep, cup-shaped cavity
called the acetabulum. This is located on the lateral side of the hip bone and is part of the hip joint. The large opening in
the anteroinferior hip bone between the ischium and pubis is the obturator foramen. This space is largely filled in by a
layer of connective tissue and serves for the attachment of muscles on both its internal and external surfaces.

 Several ligaments unite the bones of the pelvis (Figure 8.14). The largely immobile sacroiliac joint is supported by a
pair of strong ligaments that are attached between the sacrum and ilium portions of the hip bone. These are the anterior
sacroiliac ligament on the anterior side of the joint and the posterior sacroiliac ligament on the posterior side. Also
spanning the sacrum and hip bone are two additional ligaments. The sacrospinous ligament runs from the sacrum to the
ischial spine, and the sacrotuberous ligament runs from the sacrum to the ischial tuberosity.
