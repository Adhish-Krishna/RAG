depresses it to create different tones of voice.

CHAPTER 11 | THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM 431

Muscles That Move the Head

The head, attached to the top of the vertebral column, is balanced, moved, and rotated by the neck muscles (Table 11.5).
 When these muscles act unilaterally, the head rotates. When they contract bilaterally, the head flexes or extends. The major
muscle that laterally flexes and rotates the head is the sternocleidomastoid. In addition, both muscles working together are
the flexors of the head. Place your fingers on both sides of the neck and turn your head to the left and to the right. You will
feel the movement originate there. This muscle divides the neck into anterior and posterior triangles when viewed from the
side (Figure 11.14).
