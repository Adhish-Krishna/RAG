The
action potential reaches the end of the axon, called the axon terminal, and a chemical signal is released to tell the
target cell to do something—either to initiate a new action potential, or to suppress that activity. In a very short space,
the electrical signal of the action potential is changed into the chemical signal of a neurotransmitter and then back to
electrical changes in the target cell membrane. What is the importance of voltage-gated calcium channels in the release
of neurotransmitters?
