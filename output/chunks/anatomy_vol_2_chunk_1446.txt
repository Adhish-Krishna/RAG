Tissue Transplantation

Tissue transplantation is more complicated than blood transfusions because of two characteristics of MHC molecules. These
molecules are the major cause of transplant rejection (hence the name “histocompatibility”). MHC polygeny refers to the
multiple MHC proteins on cells, and MHC polymorphism refers to the multiple alleles for each individual MHC locus.
 Thus, there are many alleles in the human population that can be expressed (Table 21.8 and Table 21.9). When a donor
organ expresses MHC molecules that are different from the recipient, the latter will often mount a cytotoxic T cell response
to the organ and reject it. Histologically, if a biopsy of a transplanted organ exhibits massive infiltration of T lymphocytes
within the first weeks after transplant, it is a sign that the transplant is likely to fail. The response is a classical, and very
specific, primary T cell immune response. As far as medicine is concerned, the immune response in this scenario does the
patient no good at all and causes significant harm.
