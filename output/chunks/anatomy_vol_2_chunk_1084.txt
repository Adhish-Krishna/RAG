As the sarcomeres reach their
optimal lengths, they will contract more powerfully, because more of the myosin heads can bind to the actin on the thin
filaments, forming cross bridges and increasing the strength of contraction and SV. If this process were to continue and the
sarcomeres stretched beyond their optimal lengths, the force of contraction would decrease. However, due to the physical
constraints of the location of the heart, this excessive stretch is not a concern.

 The relationship between ventricular stretch and contraction has been stated in the well-known Frank-Starling
mechanism or simply Starlingâ€™s Law of the Heart. This principle states that, within physiological limits, the force of heart
contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of the muscle fiber. This means that the greater the stretch of the
ventricular muscle (within limits), the more powerful the contraction is, which in turn increases SV.
