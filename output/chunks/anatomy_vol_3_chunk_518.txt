The flow must be slow to allow blood cells to lose and regain water without either crenating or bursting. Second, a rapid

flow would remove too much Na” and urea, destroying the osmolar gradient that is necessary for the recovery of solutes
and water. Thus, by flowing slowly to preserve the countercurrent mechanism, as the vasa recta descend, Na” and urea are

freely able to enter the capillary, while water freely leaves; as they ascend, Na” and urea are secreted into the surrounding
medulla, while water reenters and is removed.

 Reabsorption and Secretion in the Distal Convoluted Tubule

Approximately 80 percent of filtered water has been recovered by the time the dilute forming urine enters the DCT. The
DCT will recover another 10-15 percent before the forming urine enters the collecting ducts. Aldosterone increases the

amount of Na*/K* ATPase in the basal membrane of the DCT and collecting duct.
