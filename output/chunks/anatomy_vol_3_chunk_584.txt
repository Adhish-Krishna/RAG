When blood volume decreases due to sweating, from what source is water taken in by the blood?

Most body fluids are neutral in charge. Thus, cations, or positively charged ions, and anions, or negatively charged

ions, are balanced in fluids. As seen in the previous graph, sodium (Na*) ions and chloride (Cl) ions are concentrated in

the ECF of the body, whereas potassium (K*) ions are concentrated inside cells. Although sodium and potassium can “leak”
through “pores” into and out of cells, respectively, the high levels of potassium and low levels of sodium in the ICF are
maintained by sodium-potassium pumps in the cell membranes. These pumps use the energy supplied by ATP to pump
sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell (Figure 26.6).
