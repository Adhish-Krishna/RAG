The pattern is shown in Figure 28.27, using a diagram that tracks
the likely incidence of an autosomal recessive disorder on the basis of parental genotypes.

 On the other hand, a child born to a CF carrier and someone with two unaffected alleles would have a 0 percent
probability of inheriting CF, but would have a 50 percent chance of being a carrier. Other examples of autosome recessive
genetic illnesses include the blood disorder sickle-cell anemia, the fatal neurological disorder Tay-Sachs disease, and the
metabolic disorder phenylketonuria.

two carrier parents reflects a 3:1 probability of expression among offspring.
