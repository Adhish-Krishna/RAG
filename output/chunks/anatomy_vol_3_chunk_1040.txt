Such structures include the nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, trachea, and most of the bronchial tree. The respiratory zone
includes all the organs and structures that are directly involved in gas exchange, including the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar
ducts, and alveoli. 39 The right and left lungs differ in size and shape to accommodate other organs that encroach on the thoracic
region. The right lung consists of three lobes and is shorter than the left lung, due to the position of the liver underneath it.
 The left lung consist of two lobes and is longer and narrower than the right lung. The left lung has a concave region on the
mediastinal surface called the cardiac notch that allows space for the heart. 40 There is a cavity, called the pleural cavity, between
the parietal and visceral layers of the pleura. Mesothelial cells produce and secrete pleural fluid into the pleural cavity that acts
as a lubricant. Therefore, as you breathe, the pleural fluid prevents the two layers of the pleura from rubbing against each other
and causing damage due to friction.
