Episodic memory is autobiographical in nature, such as remembering riding
a bicycle as a child around the neighborhood, as opposed to the procedural memory of how to ride a bike. HM also retained
his short-term memory, such as what is tested by the three-word task described above. After a brief period, those memories
would dissipate or decay and not be stored in the long-term because the medial temporal lobe structures were removed.
 The difference in short-term, procedural, and episodic memory, as evidenced by patient HM, suggests that there
are different parts of the brain responsible for those functions. The long-term storage of episodic memory requires the
hippocampus and related medial temporal structures, and the location of those memories is in the multimodal integration
areas of the cerebral cortex. However, short-term memory—also called working or active memory—is localized to the
prefrontal lobe.
