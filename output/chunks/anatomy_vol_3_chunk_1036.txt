47 Tuberculosis is
caused by bacteria resistant to lysosomal enzymes in alveolar macrophages, resulting in chronic infection. The immune response to
these bacteria actually causes most of the lung damage that is characteristic of this life-threatening disease. 48 The peanuts cause
high levels of mast cell degranulation in the throats of these individuals. The histamine released increases vascular permeability,
causing edema and (swelling), making breathing difficult. This must be treated with epinephrine as soon as possible. 49 Antibody
response to the cell walls of B-Streptococcus cross-reacts with the heart muscle. Complement is then activated and the heart
is damaged, leading to abnormal function. Tolerance is broken because heart myosin antigens are similar to antigens on the B-
Streptococcus bacteria. 50 Stress causes the release of hormones and the activation of nerves that suppress the immune response.
 Short-term stress has little effect on the health of an already healthy individual, whereas chronic stress does lead to increases in
disease in such people.
