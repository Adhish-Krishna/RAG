In addition, called the small and large bowel, or colloquially the “guts,” they constitute the
greatest mass and length of the alimentary canal and, with the exception of ingestion, perform all digestive system functions.

 The Small Intestine

Chyme released from the stomach enters the small intestine, which is the primary digestive organ in the body. Not only is
this where most digestion occurs, it is also where practically all absorption occurs. The longest part of the alimentary canal,
the small intestine is about 3.05 meters (10 feet) long in a living person (but about twice as long in a cadaver due to the
loss of muscle tone). Since this makes it about five times longer than the large intestine, you might wonder why it is called
“small.” In fact, its name derives from its relatively smaller diameter of only about 2.54 cm (1 in), compared with 7.62 cm
(3 in) for the large intestine.
