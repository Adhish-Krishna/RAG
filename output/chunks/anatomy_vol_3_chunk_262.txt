This results in the discharge of
hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane gases that create flatus (gas) in the colon; flatulence is excessive flatus. Each day,
up to 1500 mL of flatus is produced in the colon. More is produced when you eat foods such as beans, which are rich in
otherwise indigestible sugars and complex carbohydrates like soluble dietary fiber.

 Absorption, Feces Formation, and Defecation

The small intestine absorbs about 90 percent of the water you ingest (either as liquid or within solid food). The large
intestine absorbs most of the remaining water, a process that converts the liquid chyme residue into semisolid feces
(“stool”). Feces is composed of undigested food residues, unabsorbed digested substances, millions of bacteria, old
epithelial cells from the GI mucosa, inorganic salts, and enough water to let it pass smoothly out of the body.
