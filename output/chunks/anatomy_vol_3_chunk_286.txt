 Protein Digestion

Proteins are polymers composed of amino acids linked by peptide bonds to form long chains. Digestion reduces them to
their constituent amino acids. You usually consume about 15 to 20 percent of your total calorie intake as protein.

 The digestion of protein starts in the stomach, where HCl and pepsin break proteins into smaller polypeptides, which
then travel to the small intestine (Figure 23.30). Chemical digestion in the small intestine is continued by pancreatic
enzymes, including chymotrypsin and trypsin, each of which act on specific bonds in amino acid sequences.
