Female Reproductive System

Female fertility (the ability to conceive) peaks when women are in their twenties, and is slowly reduced until a
women reaches 35 years of age. After that time, fertility declines more rapidly, until it ends completely at the end of
menopause. Menopause is the cessation of the menstrual cycle that occurs as a result of the loss of ovarian follicles and
the hormones that they produce. A woman is considered to have completed menopause if she has not menstruated in a
full year. After that point, she is considered postmenopausal. The average age for this change is consistent worldwide
at between 50 and 52 years of age, but it can normally occur in a womanâ€™s forties, or later in her fifties.
