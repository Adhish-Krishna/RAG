At this point, the tract separates into two parts, which have control over different domains of the
musculature.

Figure 14.28 Corticospinal Tract The major descending tract that controls skeletal muscle movements is the
corticospinal tract. It is composed of two neurons, the upper motor neuron and the lower motor neuron. The upper
motor neuron has its cell body in the primary motor cortex of the frontal lobe and synapses on the lower motor neuron,
which is in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and projects to the skeletal muscle in the periphery.
