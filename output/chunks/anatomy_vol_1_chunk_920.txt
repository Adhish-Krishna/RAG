 Figure 9.13 Movements of the Body, Part 2 (g) Supination of the forearm turns the hand to the palm forward position
in which the radius and ulna are parallel, while forearm pronation turns the hand to the palm backward position in which
the radius crosses over the ulna to form an "X." (h) Dorsiflexion of the foot at the ankle joint moves the top of the foot
toward the leg, while plantar flexion lifts the heel and points the toes.
