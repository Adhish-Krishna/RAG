Also, those changes are the same for every action potential, which means that once the threshold is reached, the exact same
thing happens. A stronger stimulus, which might depolarize the membrane well past threshold, will not make a “bigger”
action potential. Action potentials are “all or none.” Either the membrane reaches the threshold and everything occurs as
described above, or the membrane does not reach the threshold and nothing else happens. All action potentials peak at the
same voltage (+30 mV), so one action potential is not bigger than another. Stronger stimuli will initiate multiple action
potentials more quickly, but the individual signals are not bigger. Thus, for example, you will not feel a greater sensation of
pain, or have a stronger muscle contraction, because of the size of the action potential because they are not different sizes.
