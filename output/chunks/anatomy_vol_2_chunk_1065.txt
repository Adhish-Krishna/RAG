Consider this phenomenon in a healthy young individual. Initially, as HR increases
rom resting to approximately 120 bpm, CO will rise. As HR increases from 120 to 160 bpm, CO remains stable, since the
increase in rate is offset by decreasing ventricular filling time and, consequently, SV. As HR continues to rise above 160
bpm, CO actually decreases as SV falls faster than HR increases. So although aerobic exercises are critical to maintain the
health of the heart, individuals are cautioned to monitor their HR to ensure they stay within the target heart rate range of
between 120 and 160 bpm, so CO is maintained. The target HR is loosely defined as the range in which both the heart and
lungs receive the maximum benefit from the aerobic workout and is dependent upon age.

 Cardiovascular Centers

ervous control over HR is centralized within the two paired cardiovascular centers of the medulla oblongata (Figure
19.32).
