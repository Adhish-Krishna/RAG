Both regions were originally described on the basis of losses of speech and language, which is called aphasia.
 The aphasia associated with Broca’s area is known as an expressive aphasia, which means that speech production is
compromised. This type of aphasia is often described as non-fluency because the ability to say some words leads to broken
or halting speech. Grammar can also appear to be lost. The aphasia associated with Wernicke’s area is known as a receptive
aphasia, which is not a loss of speech production, but a loss of understanding of content. Patients, after recovering from
acute forms of this aphasia, report not being able to understand what is said to them or what they are saying themselves, but
they often cannot keep from talking.

 The two regions are connected by white matter tracts that run between the posterior temporal lobe and the lateral aspect
of the frontal lobe.
