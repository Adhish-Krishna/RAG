Monocytes originate from myeloid stem cells. They normally represent 2-8 percent of the total leukocyte count. They
are typically easily recognized by their large size of 12-20 ym and indented or horseshoe-shaped nuclei. Macrophages are
monocytes that have left the circulation and phagocytize debris, foreign pathogens, worn-out erythrocytes, and many other
dead, worn out, or damaged cells. Macrophages also release antimicrobial defensins and chemotactic chemicals that attract
other leukocytes to the site of an infection. Some macrophages occupy fixed locations, whereas others wander through the
tissue fluid.

 Abnormally high counts of monocytes are associated with viral or fungal infections, tuberculosis, and some forms of
leukemia and other chronic diseases. Abnormally low counts are typically caused by suppression of the bone marrow.

 Lifecycle of Leukocytes

Most leukocytes have a relatively short lifespan, typically measured in hours or days. Production of all leukocytes begins
in the bone marrow under the influence of CSFs and interleukins.
