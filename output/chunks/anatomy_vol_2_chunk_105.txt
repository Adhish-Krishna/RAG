The electrical gradient also
plays a role, as negative proteins below the membrane attract the sodium ion. The membrane potential will reach +30 mV
by the time sodium has entered the cell.

 As the membrane potential reaches +30 mV, other voltage-gated channels are opening in the membrane. These

channels are specific for the potassium ion. A concentration gradient acts on K*, as well. As K‚Äù starts to leave the
cell, taking a positive charge with it, the membrane potential begins to move back toward its resting voltage. This is
called repolarization, meaning that the membrane voltage moves back toward the -70 mV value of the resting membrane
potential.

 Repolarization returns the membrane potential to the -70 mV value that indicates the resting potential, but it actually
overshoots that value. Potassium ions reach equilibrium when the membrane voltage is below -70 mV, so a period of

hyperpolarization occurs while the K* channels are open.
