12.3 | The Function of Nervous Tissue

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 ¢ Distinguish the major functions of the nervous system: sensation, integration, and response
¢ List the sequence of events in a simple sensory receptor—motor response pathway

Having looked at the components of nervous tissue, and the basic anatomy of the nervous system, next comes an
understanding of how nervous tissue is capable of communicating within the nervous system. Before getting to the nuts and
bolts of how this works, an illustration of how the components come together will be helpful. An example is summarized in
Figure 12.14.
