The menisci provide padding between the bones and help to fill the
gap between the round femoral condyles and flattened tibial condyles. Some areas of each meniscus lack an arterial blood
supply and thus these areas heal poorly if damaged.
 The knee joint has multiple ligaments that provide support, particularly in the extended position (see Figure 9.19c).
 Outside of the articular capsule, located at the sides of the knee, are two extrinsic ligaments. The fibular collateral ligament
(lateral collateral ligament) is on the lateral side and spans from the lateral epicondyle of the femur to the head of the fibula.
 The tibial collateral ligament (medial collateral ligament) of the medial knee runs from the medial epicondyle of the femur
to the medial tibia. As it crosses the knee, the tibial collateral ligament is firmly attached on its deep side to the articular
capsule and to the medial meniscus, an important factor when considering knee injuries.
