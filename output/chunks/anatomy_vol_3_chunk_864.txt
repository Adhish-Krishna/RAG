Suckling triggers sensory nerve impulses in the areola.

 Brain receives sensory impulses from the
areola and releases oxytocin (OT) from Lactocytes in mammary alveoli produce
the hypothalamus and posterior pituitary. milk in response to sensory nerve impulses.

Oxytocin (OT) triggers myoepithelial cells to
squeeze milk from alveoli so it drains into
lactiferous ducts.
