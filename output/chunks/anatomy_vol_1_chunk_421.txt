In dense irregular connective tissue, the direction of fibers is random. This arrangement gives the tissue greater strength
in all directions and less strength in one particular direction. In some tissues, fibers crisscross and form a mesh. In other
tissues, stretching in several directions is achieved by alternating layers where fibers run in the same orientation in each
layer, and it is the layers themselves that are stacked at an angle. The dermis of the skin is an example of dense irregular
connective tissue rich in collagen fibers. Dense irregular elastic tissues give arterial walls the strength and the ability to
regain original shape after stretching (Figure 4.15).
