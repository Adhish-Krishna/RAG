Bacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae, the cause of leprosy, are resistant to lysosomal enzymes and can persist
in macrophage organelles or escape into the cytosol. In such situations, infected macrophages receiving cytokine signals
from Th1 cells turn on special metabolic pathways. Macrophage oxidative metabolism is hostile to intracellular bacteria,
often relying on the production of nitric oxide to kill the bacteria inside the macrophage.

 Fungal infections, such as those from Aspergillus, Candida, and Pneumocystis, are largely opportunistic infections that
take advantage of suppressed immune responses. Most of the same immune mechanisms effective against bacteria have
similar effects on fungi, both of which have characteristic cell wall structures that protect their cells.

 Defenses against Parasites

Worm parasites such as helminths are seen as the primary reason why the mucosal immune response, IgE-mediated allergy
and asthma, and eosinophils evolved. These parasites were at one time very common in human society. When infecting a
human, often via contaminated food, some worms take up residence in the gastrointestinal tract.
