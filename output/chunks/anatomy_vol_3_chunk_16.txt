Carbon dioxide is
exhaled and oxygen is inhaled through the respiratory system, which includes muscles to move air into and out of the lungs,
passageways through which air moves, and microscopic gas exchange surfaces covered by capillaries. The circulatory
system transports gases from the lungs to tissues throughout the body and vice versa. A variety of diseases can affect the
respiratory system, such as asthma, emphysema, chronic obstruction pulmonary disorder (COPD), and lung cancer. All of
these conditions affect the gas exchange process and result in labored breathing and other difficulties.

 22.1 | Organs and Structures of the Respiratory System

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
Â¢ List the structures that make up the respiratory system
* Describe how the respiratory system processes oxygen and CO2
* Compare and contrast the functions of upper respiratory tract with the lower respiratory tract

The major organs of the respiratory system function primarily to provide oxygen to body tissues for cellular respiration,
remove the waste product carbon dioxide, and help to maintain acid-base balance.
