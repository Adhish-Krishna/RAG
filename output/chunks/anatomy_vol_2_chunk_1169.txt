The relationships among blood vessels that
can be compared include (a) vessel diameter, (b) total cross-sectional area, (c) average blood pressure, and (d)

velocity of blood flow.

Cardiovascular System: Arteriosclerosis

Compliance allows an artery to expand when blood is pumped through it from the heart, and then to recoil after the
surge has passed. This helps promote blood flow. In arteriosclerosis, compliance is reduced, and pressure and resistance
within the vessel increase. This is a leading cause of hypertension and coronary heart disease, as it causes the heart to
work harder to generate a pressure great enough to overcome the resistance.

 Arteriosclerosis begins with injury to the endothelium of an artery, which may be caused by irritation from high
blood glucose, infection, tobacco use, excessive blood lipids, and other factors.
