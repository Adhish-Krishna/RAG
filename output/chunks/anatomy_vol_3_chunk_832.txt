The uterus grows throughout pregnancy to accommodate the
fetus.

 Effects of Hormones

Virtually all of the effects of pregnancy can be attributed in some way to the influence of hormones—particularly estrogens,
progesterone, and hCG. During weeks 7-12 from the LMP, the pregnancy hormones are primarily generated by the corpus
luteum. Progesterone secreted by the corpus luteum stimulates the production of decidual cells of the endometrium that
nourish the blastocyst before placentation. As the placenta develops and the corpus luteum degenerates during weeks 12-17,
the placenta gradually takes over as the endocrine organ of pregnancy.

 The placenta converts weak androgens secreted by the maternal and fetal adrenal glands to estrogens, which are
necessary for pregnancy to progress. Estrogen levels climb throughout the pregnancy, increasing 30-fold by childbirth.
 Estrogens have the following actions:

¢ They suppress FSH and LH production, effectively preventing ovulation. (This function is the biological basis of
hormonal birth control pills.)
