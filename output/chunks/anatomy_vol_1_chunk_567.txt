Immature osteogenic cells are found in the deep layers of
the periosteum and the marrow. They differentiate and develop into osteoblasts.

 The dynamic nature of bone means that new tissue is constantly formed, and old, injured, or unnecessary bone is
dissolved for repair or for calcium release. The cell responsible for bone resorption, or breakdown, is the osteoclast. They
are found on bone surfaces, are multinucleated, and originate from monocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood
cells, not from osteogenic cells. Osteoclasts are continually breaking down old bone while osteoblasts are continually
forming new bone. The ongoing balance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts is responsible for the constant but subtle
reshaping of bone. Table 6.3 reviews the bone cells, their functions, and locations.

Compact and Spongy Bone

The differences between compact and spongy bone are best explored via their histology.
