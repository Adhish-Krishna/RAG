Conduction aphasia associated with damage to this connection refers to the problem of connecting the
understanding of language to the production of speech. This is a very rare condition, but is likely to present as an inability
to faithfully repeat spoken language.

Broca's area Wernicke's area

Figure 16.6 Broca's and Wernicke's Areas Two important integration areas of the cerebral cortex associated with
language function are Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas. The two areas are connected through the deep white matter
running from the posterior temporal lobe to the frontal lobe.

 Sensorium

Those parts of the brain involved in the reception and interpretation of sensory stimuli are referred to collectively as the
sensorium. The cerebral cortex has several regions that are necessary for sensory perception. From the primary cortical
areas of the somatosensory, visual, auditory, and gustatory senses to the association areas that process information in these
modalities, the cerebral cortex is the seat of conscious sensory perception.
