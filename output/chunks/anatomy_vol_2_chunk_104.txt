This starts with a channel opening for Na’ in the membrane. Because the concentration of Na’ is higher outside the cell
than inside the cell by a factor of 10, ions will rush into the cell that are driven largely by the concentration gradient. Because
sodium is a positively charged ion, it will change the relative voltage immediately inside the cell relative to immediately
outside. The resting potential is the state of the membrane at a voltage of -70 mV, so the sodium cation entering the cell will
cause it to become less negative. This is known as depolarization, meaning the membrane potential moves toward zero.

 The concentration gradient for Na’ is so strong that it will continue to enter the cell even after the membrane potential
has become zero, so that the voltage immediately around the pore begins to become positive.
