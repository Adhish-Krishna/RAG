The utility of this technique in movements. To what functional division of the nervous
the nervous system is that fat tissue and water appear as system would these structures belong?

different shades between black and white. Because white 3.
matter is fatty (from myelin) and gray matter is not, they can
be easily distinguished in MRI images. Visit the Nobel Prize
website (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/nobel_2) to play an
interactive game that demonstrates the use of this technology
and compares it with other types of imaging technologies.
 Also, the results from an MRI session are compared with
images obtained from x-ray or computed tomography. How
do the imaging techniques shown in this game indicate the
separation of white and gray matter compared with the
freshly dissected tissue shown earlier?
