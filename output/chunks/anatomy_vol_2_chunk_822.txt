The extracellular matrix, called plasma, makes blood unique among
connective tissues because it is fluid. This fluid, which is mostly water, perpetually suspends the formed elements and
enables them to circulate throughout the body within the cardiovascular system.

 Functions of Blood

The primary function of blood is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to and remove wastes from body cells, but that is only
the beginning of the story. The specific functions of blood also include defense, distribution of heat, and maintenance of
homeostasis.

 Transportation

utrients from the foods you eat are absorbed in the digestive tract. Most of these travel in the bloodstream directly to the
liver, where they are processed and released back into the bloodstream for delivery to body cells. Oxygen from the air you
breathe diffuses into the blood, which moves from the lungs to the heart, which then pumps it out to the rest of the body.
