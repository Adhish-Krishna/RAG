Oxytocin causes stronger contractions of the smooth muscles in of the uterus (the effectors), pushing the baby
further down the birth canal. This causes even greater stretching of the cervix. The cycle of stretching, oxytocin release, and
increasingly more forceful contractions stops only when the baby is born. At this point, the stretching of the cervix halts,
stopping the release of oxytocin.

 A second example of positive feedback centers on reversing extreme damage to the body. Following a penetrating
wound, the most immediate threat is excessive blood loss. Less blood circulating means reduced blood pressure and reduced
perfusion (penetration of blood) to the brain and other vital organs. If perfusion is severely reduced, vital organs will shut
down and the person will die. The body responds to this potential catastrophe by releasing substances in the injured blood
vessel wall that begin the process of blood clotting. As each step of clotting occurs, it stimulates the release of more clotting
substances.
