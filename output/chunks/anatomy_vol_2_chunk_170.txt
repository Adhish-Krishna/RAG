By following
the developmental pattern, it is possible to learn what the major regions of the nervous system are.

 The Neural Tube

To begin, a sperm cell and an egg cell fuse to become a fertilized egg. The fertilized egg cell, or zygote, starts dividing to
generate the cells that make up an entire organism. Sixteen days after fertilization, the developing embryoâ€™s cells belong to
one of three germ layers that give rise to the different tissues in the body. The endoderm, or inner tissue, is responsible for
generating the lining tissues of various spaces within the body, such as the mucosae of the digestive and respiratory systems.
 The mesoderm, or middle tissue, gives rise to most of the muscle and connective tissues. Finally the ectoderm, or outer
tissue, develops into the integumentary system (the skin) and the nervous system. It is probably not difficult to see that the
outer tissue of the embryo becomes the outer covering of the body.
