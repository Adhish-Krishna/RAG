Oxygenated blood traveling through the systemic arteries has large amounts of oxyhemoglobin.
 As blood passes through the tissues, much of the oxygen is released into systemic capillaries. The deoxygenated blood returning
through the systemic veins, therefore, contains much smaller amounts of oxyhemoglobin. The more oxyhemoglobin that is present
in the blood, the redder the fluid will be. As a result, oxygenated blood will be much redder in color than deoxygenated blood. 4

the nasopharynx, which is connected to the posterior nasal cavity and functions as an airway. The second region is the oropharynx,
which is continuous with the nasopharynx and is connected to the oral cavity at the fauces. The laryngopharynx is connected to
the oropharynx and the esophagus and trachea.
