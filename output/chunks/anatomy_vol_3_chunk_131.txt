The lungs are innervated by the parasympathetic and sympathetic
nervous systems, which coordinate the bronchodilation and bronchoconstriction of the airways. The lungs are enclosed by
the pleura, a membrane that is composed of visceral and parietal pleural layers. The space between these two layers is called
the pleural cavity. The mesothelial cells of the pleural membrane create pleural fluid, which serves as both a lubricant (to
reduce friction during breathing) and as an adhesive to adhere the lungs to the thoracic wall (to facilitate movement of the
lungs during ventilation).

 22.3 The Process of Breathing

Pulmonary ventilation is the process of breathing, which is driven by pressure differences between the lungs and the
atmosphere. Atmospheric pressure is the force exerted by gases present in the atmosphere. The force exerted by gases within
the alveoli is called intra-alveolar (intrapulmonary) pressure, whereas the force exerted by gases in the pleural cavity is
called intrapleural pressure.
