Antidiuretic Hormone

Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, is secreted by the cells in the hypothalamus and transported via
the hypothalamic-hypophyseal tracts to the posterior pituitary where it is stored until released upon nervous stimulation.
 The primary trigger prompting the hypothalamus to release ADH is increasing osmolarity of tissue fluid, usually in response
to significant loss of blood volume. ADH signals its target cells in the kidneys to reabsorb more water, thus preventing the
loss of additional fluid in the urine. This will increase overall fluid levels and help restore blood volume and pressure. In
addition, ADH constricts peripheral vessels.

 Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone Mechanism

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone mechanism has a major effect upon the cardiovascular system (Figure 20.19). Renin is
an enzyme, although because of its importance in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway, some sources identify it as
a hormone.
