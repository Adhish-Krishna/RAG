Spinal Nerves

The nerves connected to the spinal cord are the spinal nerves. The arrangement of these nerves is much more regular than
that of the cranial nerves. All of the spinal nerves are combined sensory and motor axons that separate into two nerve roots.
 The sensory axons enter the spinal cord as the dorsal nerve root. The motor fibers, both somatic and autonomic, emerge as
the ventral nerve root. The dorsal root ganglion for each nerve is an enlargement of the spinal nerve.

 There are 31 spinal nerves, named for the level of the spinal cord at which each one emerges.
