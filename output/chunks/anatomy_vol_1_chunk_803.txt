Pubis

The pubis forms the anterior portion of the hip bone (see Figure 8.13). The enlarged medial portion of the pubis is the pubic
body. Located superiorly on the pubic body is a small bump called the pubic tubercle. The superior pubic ramus is the
segment of bone that passes laterally from the pubic body to join the ilium. The narrow ridge running along the superior
margin of the superior pubic ramus is the pectineal line of the pubis.

 The pubic body is joined to the pubic body of the opposite hip bone by the pubic symphysis. Extending downward and
laterally from the body is the inferior pubic ramus. The pubic arch is the bony structure formed by the pubic symphysis,

and the bodies and inferior pubic rami of the adjacent pubic bones. The inferior pubic ramus extends downward to join
the ischial ramus. Together, these form the single ischiopubic ramus, which extends from the pubic body to the ischial
tuberosity.
