The concentration of this direct application is
probably below the concentration that would cause poisoning if it got into the bloodstream. The possibility of that concentration
being wrong and causing poisoning is too great, however, for atropine to be used as a cosmetic.

 Chapter 16

1 Coordination and gait were tested first, followed by mental status, motor, sensory, and reflexes. There were no specific tests
of the cranial nerves. 2 History is the report from the patient, or others familiar with the patient, that can assist in diagnosis
and formulation of treatment and careâ€”essentially the result of an interview with the patient. 3 The patient was unable to form
episodic memories during the events described in the case, so the medial temporal lobe structures might have been affected by
the antibodies. 4 The left hemisphere of the cerebrum controls the right side of the body through the corticospinal tract. Because
language function is largely associated with the dominant hemisphere, the hand with which a person writes will most likely be the
one controlled by the left hemisphere.
