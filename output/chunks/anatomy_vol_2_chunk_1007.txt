Treatments may include medication, changes to diet and exercise, angioplasty with a balloon
catheter, insertion of a stent, or coronary bypass procedure.

 Angioplasty is a procedure in which the occlusion is mechanically widened with a balloon. A specialized catheter
with an expandable tip is inserted into a superficial vessel, normally in the leg, and then directed to the site of the
occlusion. At this point, the balloon is inflated to compress the plaque material and to open the vessel to increase blood
flow. Then, the balloon is deflated and retracted. A stent consisting of a specialized mesh is typically inserted at the
site of occlusion to reinforce the weakened and damaged walls. Stent insertions have been routine in cardiology for
more than 40 years.

 Coronary bypass surgery may also be performed. This surgical procedure grafts a replacement vessel obtained
from another, less vital portion of the body to bypass the occluded area.
