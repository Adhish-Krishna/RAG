The artery, vein, and renal pelvis are arranged in an anterior-to-posterior order.

 Nephrons and Vessels

The renal artery first divides into segmental arteries, followed by further branching to form interlobar arteries that pass
through the renal columns to reach the cortex (Figure 25.9). The interlobar arteries, in turn, branch into arcuate arteries,
cortical radiate arteries, and then into afferent arterioles. The afferent arterioles service about 1.3 million nephrons in each
kidney.

Figure 25.9 Blood Flow in the Kidney

Nephrons are the “functional units” of the kidney; they cleanse the blood and balance the constituents of the
circulation. The afferent arterioles form a tuft of high-pressure capillaries about 200 jm in diameter, the glomerulus.
 The rest of the nephron consists of a continuous sophisticated tubule whose proximal end surrounds the glomerulus in an
intimate embrace—this is Bowman’s capsule.
