* They induce the growth of fetal tissues and are necessary for the maturation of the fetal lungs and liver.

 * They promote fetal viability by regulating progesterone production and triggering fetal synthesis of cortisol, which
helps with the maturation of the lungs, liver, and endocrine organs such as the thyroid gland and adrenal gland.

 ¢ They stimulate maternal tissue growth, leading to uterine enlargement and mammary duct expansion and branching.

 Relaxin, another hormone secreted by the corpus luteum and then by the placenta, helps prepare the mother’s body for
childbirth. It increases the elasticity of the symphysis pubis joint and pelvic ligaments, making room for the growing fetus
and allowing expansion of the pelvic outlet for childbirth. Relaxin also helps dilate the cervix during labor.

 The placenta takes over the synthesis and secretion of progesterone throughout pregnancy as the corpus luteum

degenerates. Like estrogen, progesterone suppresses FSH and LH. It also inhibits uterine contractions, protecting the fetus
rom preterm birth.
