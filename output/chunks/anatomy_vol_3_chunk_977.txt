and ulna bones of the forearm and the tibia and fibula bones of the leg are united by interosseous membranes. 56 The teeth
are anchored into their sockets within the bony jaws by the periodontal ligaments. This is a gomphosis type of fibrous joint. In
scurvy, collagen production is inhibited and the periodontal ligaments become weak. This will cause the teeth to become loose or
even to fall out. 57 Cartilaginous joints are where the adjacent bones are joined by cartilage. At a synchondrosis, the bones are
united by hyaline cartilage. The epiphyseal plate of growing long bones and the first sternocostal joint that unites the first rib to
the sternum are examples of synchondroses. At a symphysis, the bones are joined by fibrocartilage, which is strong and flexible.
 Symphysis joints include the intervertebral symphysis between adjacent vertebrae and the pubic symphysis that joins the pubic
portions of the right and left hip bones.
