In other tissues, water and small molecules are filtered
through capillaries as the major contributor to the interstitial fluid. In the brain, CSF is produced in special structures to
perfuse through the nervous tissue of the CNS and is continuous with the interstitial fluid. Specifically, CSF circulates to
remove metabolic wastes from the interstitial fluids of nervous tissues and return them to the blood stream. The ventricles
are the open spaces within the brain where CSF circulates. In some of these spaces, CSF is produced by filtering of the blood
that is performed by a specialized membrane known as a choroid plexus. The CSF circulates through all of the ventricles to
eventually emerge into the subarachnoid space where it will be reabsorbed into the blood.

 The Ventricles

There are four ventricles within the brain, all of which developed from the original hollow space within the neural tube,
the central canal.
