Embryogenesis

 As the third week of development begins, the two-layered disc of cells becomes a three-layered disc through the process
of gastrulation, during which the cells transition from totipotency to multipotency. The embryo, which takes the shape of
an oval-shaped disc, forms an indentation called the primitive streak along the dorsal surface of the epiblast. A node at
the caudal or “tail” end of the primitive streak emits growth factors that direct cells to multiply and migrate. Cells migrate
toward and through the primitive streak and then move laterally to create two new layers of cells. The first layer is the
endoderm, a sheet of cells that displaces the hypoblast and lies adjacent to the yolk sac. The second layer of cells fills in
as the middle layer, or mesoderm. The cells of the epiblast that remain (not having migrated through the primitive streak)
become the ectoderm (Figure 28.9).
