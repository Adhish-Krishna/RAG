Highly coordinated contractions of cardiac muscle pump blood into the
vessels of the circulatory system. Similar to skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is striated and organized into sarcomeres,
possessing the same banding organization as skeletal muscle (Figure 10.21). However, cardiac muscle fibers are shorter
than skeletal muscle fibers and usually contain only one nucleus, which is located in the central region of the cell. Cardiac
muscle fibers also possess many mitochondria and myoglobin, as ATP is produced primarily through aerobic metabolism.
 Cardiac muscle fibers cells also are extensively branched and are connected to one another at their ends by intercalated
discs. An intercalated disc allows the cardiac muscle cells to contract in a wave-like pattern so that the heart can work as a

pump.
