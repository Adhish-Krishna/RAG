In a gas, pressure is a force created by the movement of gas molecules that are confined. F
example, a certain number of gas molecules in a two-liter container has more room than the same number of gas molecu!
in a one-liter container (Figure 22.15). In this case, the force exerted by the movement of the gas molecules against t

walls of the two-liter container is lower than the force exerted by the gas molecules in the one-liter container. Therefore,

 pressure is lower in the two-liter container and higher in the one-liter container. At a constant temperature, changing t
lume occupied by the gas changes the pressure, as does changing the number of gas molecules. Boyleâ€™s law describ:
relationship between volume and pressure in a gas at a constant temperature. Boyle discovered that the pressure o:

gas is inversely proportional to its volume: If volume increases, pressure decreases.
