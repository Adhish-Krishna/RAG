Together, the muscular system and skeletal system are known as the musculoskeletal
system.

 6.2 Bone Classification

Bones can be classified according to their shapes. Long bones, such as the femur, are longer than they are wide. Short bones,
such as the carpals, are approximately equal in length, width, and thickness. Flat bones are thin, but are often curved, such
as the ribs. Irregular bones such as those of the face have no characteristic shape. Sesamoid bones, such as the patellae, are
small and round, and are located in tendons.

6.3 Bone Structure

A hollow medullary cavity filled with yellow marrow runs the length of the diaphysis of a long bone. The walls of the
diaphysis are compact bone. The epiphyses, which are wider sections at each end of a long bone, are filled with spongy
bone and red marrow. The epiphyseal plate, a layer of hyaline cartilage, is replaced by osseous tissue as the organ grows in
length.
