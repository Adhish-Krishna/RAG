In this way, dominant lethal alleles can be maintained in the human
population. Individuals with a family history of Huntington’s disease are typically offered genetic counseling, which can
help them decide whether or not they wish to be tested for the faulty gene.

 Mutations

A mutation is a change in the sequence of DNA nucleotides that may or may not affect a person’s phenotype. Mutations
can arise spontaneously from errors during DNA replication, or they can result from environmental insults such as radiation,
certain viruses, or exposure to tobacco smoke or other toxic chemicals. Because genes encode for the assembly of proteins,
a mutation in the nucleotide sequence of a gene can change amino acid sequence and, consequently, a protein’s structure
and function. Spontaneous mutations occurring during meiosis are thought to account for many spontaneous abortions
(miscarriages).

 Chromosomal Disorders

Sometimes a genetic disease is not caused by a mutation in a gene, but by the presence of an incorrect number of
chromosomes.
