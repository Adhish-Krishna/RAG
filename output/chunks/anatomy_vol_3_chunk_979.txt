Ligaments hold the bones together and also serve to resist or prevent excessive or abnormal movements
of the joint. 60 Direct support for a synovial joint is provided by ligaments that strongly unite the bones of the joint and serve to
resist excessive or abnormal movements. Some joints, such as the sternoclavicular joint, have an articular disc that is attached to
both bones, where it provides direct support by holding the bones together. Indirect joint support is provided by the muscles and
their tendons that act across a joint. Muscles will increase their contractile force to help support the joint by resisting forces acting
onit. 61 Ball-and-socket joints are multiaxial joints that allow for flexion and extension, abduction and adduction, circumduction,
and medial and lateral rotation. 62 To cross your arms, you need to use both your shoulder and elbow joints. At the shoulder, the
arm would need to flex and medially rotate. At the elbow, the forearm would need to be flexed.
