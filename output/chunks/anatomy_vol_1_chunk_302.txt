The cytoskeleton forms a complex thread-like network throughout the cell consisting of three different kinds o
protein-based filaments: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules (Figure 3.18). The thickest of the three
is the microtubule, a structural filament composed of subunits of a protein called tubulin. Microtubules maintain cell shape
and structure, help resist compression of the cell, and play a role in positioning the organelles within the cell. Microtubules
also make up two types of cellular appendages important for motion: cilia and flagella. Cilia are found on many cells o
the body, including the epithelial cells that line the airways of the respiratory system. Cilia move rhythmically; they beat
constantly, moving waste materials such as dust, mucus, and bacteria upward through the airways, away from the lungs and
toward the mouth. Beating cilia on cells in the female fallopian tubes move egg cells from the ovary towards the uterus. A
flagellum (plural = flagella) is an appendage larger than a cilium and specialized for cell locomotion.
