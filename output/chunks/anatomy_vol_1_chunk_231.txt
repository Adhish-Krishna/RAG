Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)

Figure 2.30 Structure of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)

When a phosphate group is cleaved from ATP, the products are adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate
(Pi). This hydrolysis reaction can be written:
ATP +H,O > ADP +P; + energy

Removal of a second phosphate leaves adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and two phosphate groups. Again, these
reactions also liberate the energy that had been stored in the phosphate-phosphate bonds. They are reversible, too, as when
ADP undergoes phosphorylation. Phosphorylation is the addition of a phosphate group to an organic compound, in this
case, resulting in ATP. In such cases, the same level of energy that had been released during hydrolysis must be reinvested
to power dehydration synthesis.

 Cells can also transfer a phosphate group from ATP to another organic compound. For example, when glucose first
enters a cell, a phosphate group is transferred from ATP, forming glucose phosphate (CgH120gâ€”P) and ADP.
