NK cells, however, can recognize virally infected class I-negative cells and destroy them. Thus, NK and cytotoxic
T cells have complementary activities against virally infected cells.

 Interferons have activity in slowing viral replication and are used in the treatment of certain viral diseases, such as
hepatitis B and C, but their ability to eliminate the virus completely is limited. The cytotoxic T cell response, though, is
key, as it eventually overwhelms the virus and kills infected cells before the virus can complete its replicative cycle. Clonal
expansion and the ability of cytotoxic T cells to kill more than one target cell make these cells especially effective against
viruses. In fact, without cytotoxic T cells, it is likely that humans would all die at some point from a viral infection (if no
vaccine were available).

 Evasion of the Immune System by Pathogens

It is important to keep in mind that although the immune system has evolved to be able to control many pathogens,
pathogens themselves have evolved ways to evade the immune response.
