Peroxisomes perform a couple of different functions, including lipid metabolism and chemical detoxification. In contrast to
the digestive enzymes found in lysosomes, the enzymes within peroxisomes serve to transfer hydrogen atoms from various
molecules to oxygen, producing hydrogen peroxide (H202). In this way, peroxisomes neutralize poisons such as alcohol. In
order to appreciate the importance of peroxisomes, it is necessary to understand the concept of reactive oxygen species.

Figure 3.17 Peroxisome Peroxisomes are membrane-bound organelles that contain an abundance of enzymes for
detoxifying harmful substances and lipid metabolism.

 Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as peroxides and free radicals are the highly reactive products of many normal
cellular processes, including the mitochondrial reactions that produce ATP and oxygen metabolism. Examples of ROS
include the hydroxyl radical OH, H2O2, and superoxide (O} ). Some ROS are important for certain cellular functions,

such as cell signaling processes and immune responses against foreign substances.
