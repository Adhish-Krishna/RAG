The images in your peripheral
vision are focused by the peripheral retina, and have vague, blurry edges and words that are not as clearly identified. As a
result, a large part of the neural function of the eyes is concerned with moving the eyes and head so that important visual
stimuli are centered on the fovea.

 Light falling on the retina causes chemical changes to pigment molecules in the photoreceptors, ultimately leading
to a change in the activity of the RGCs. Photoreceptor cells have two parts, the inner segment and the outer segment
(Figure 14.16). The inner segment contains the nucleus and other common organelles of a cell, whereas the outer segment
is a specialized region in which photoreception takes place. There are two types of photoreceptors—rods and cones—which
differ in the shape of their outer segment. The rod-shaped outer segments of the rod photoreceptor contain a stack
of membrane-bound discs that contain the photosensitive pigment rhodopsin.
