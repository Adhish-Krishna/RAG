778 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART

* Describe the effects of exercise on cardiac output and heart rate

* Name the centers of the brain that control heart rate and describe their function
* Identify other factors affecting heart rate

* Describe fetal heart development

In this chapter, you will explore the remarkable pump that propels the blood into the vessels. There is no single better
word to describe the function of the heart other than “pump,” since its contraction develops the pressure that ejects blood
into the major vessels: the aorta and pulmonary trunk. From these vessels, the blood is distributed to the remainder of the
body. Although the connotation of the term “pump” suggests a mechanical device made of steel and plastic, the anatomical
structure is a living, sophisticated muscle.
