Venous return
determines preload and the atrial reflex. Filling time directly related to HR also determines preload. Preload then impacts
both EDV and ESV. Autonomic innervation and hormones largely regulate contractility. Contractility impacts EDV as does
afterload. CO is the product of HR multiplied by SV. SV is the difference between EDV and ESV.

 19.5 Development of the Heart

The heart is the first organ to form and become

â€˜unctional, emphasizing the importance of transport of material to and from

the developing infant. It originates about day 18 or 19 from the mesoderm and begins beating and pumping blood about
day 21 or 22. It forms from the cardiogenic region near the head and is visible as a prominent heart bulge on the surface

of the embryo. Originally, it consists of a pair o

strands called cardiogenic cords that quickly form a hollow lumen and are

referred to as endocardial tubes.
