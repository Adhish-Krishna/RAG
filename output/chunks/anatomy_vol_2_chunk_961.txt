Auricles are relatively thin-walled structures
that can fill with blood and empty into the atria or upper chambers of the heart. You may also hear them referred to as atrial
appendages. Also prominent is a series of fat-filled grooves, each of which is known as a sulcus (plural = sulci), along
the superior surfaces of the heart. Major coronary blood vessels are located in these sulci. The deep coronary sulcus is
located between the atria and ventricles. Located between the left and right ventricles are two additional sulci that are not
as deep as the coronary sulcus. The anterior interventricular sulcus is visible on the anterior surface of the heart, whereas

posterior views of the surface of the heart.
