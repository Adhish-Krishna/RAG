This synovial fluid readily exchanges water and nutrients with blood, as do all body
fluids.

Epithelial Membranes

The epithelial membrane is composed of epithelium attached to a layer of connective tissue, for example, your skin. The
mucous membrane is also a composite of connective and epithelial tissues. Sometimes called mucosae, these epithelial
membranes line the body cavities and hollow passageways that open to the external environment, and include the digestive,
respiratory, excretory, and reproductive tracts. Mucous, produced by the epithelial exocrine glands, covers the epithelial
layer. The underlying connective tissue, called the lamina propria (literally “own layer”), help support the fragile epithelial
layer.

 A serous membrane is an epithelial membrane composed of mesodermally derived epithelium called the mesothelium
that is supported by connective tissue. These membranes line the coelomic cavities of the body, that is, those cavities that
do not open to the outside, and they cover the organs located within those cavities.
