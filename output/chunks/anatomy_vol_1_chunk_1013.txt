10.2 | Skeletal Muscle

 By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the layers of connective tissues packaging skeletal muscle
¢ Explain how muscles work with tendons to move the body
¢ Identify areas of the skeletal muscle fibers
 ¢ Describe excitation-contraction coupling

The best-known feature of skeletal muscle is its ability to contract and cause movement. Skeletal muscles act not only to
produce movement but also to stop movement, such as resisting gravity to maintain posture. Small, constant adjustments of
the skeletal muscles are needed to hold a body upright or balanced in any position. Muscles also prevent excess movement
of the bones and joints, maintaining skeletal stability and preventing skeletal structure damage or deformation. Joints can
become misaligned or dislocated entirely by pulling on the associated bones; muscles work to keep joints stable. Skeletal
muscles are located throughout the body at the openings of internal tracts to control the movement of various substances.
