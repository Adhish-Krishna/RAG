The two thalami touch
in the center in most brains as the massa intermedia, which is surrounded by the third ventricle. The cerebral aqueduct opens
just inferior to the epithalamus and passes through the midbrain. The tectum and tegmentum of the midbrain are the roo:
and floor of the cerebral aqueduct, respectively. The aqueduct opens up into the fourth ventricle. The floor of the fourth
ventricle is the dorsal surface of the pons and upper medulla (that gray matter making a continuation of the tegmentum o:
the midbrain). The fourth ventricle then narrows into the central canal of the spinal cord.

 The ventricular system opens up to the subarachnoid space from the fourth ventricle. The single median aperture and
the pair of lateral apertures connect to the subarachnoid space so that CSF can flow through the ventricles and around
the outside of the CNS. Cerebrospinal fluid is produced within the ventricles by a type of specialized membrane called
a choroid plexus.
