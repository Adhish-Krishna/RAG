While the
nervous system can influence the excitability of cardiac and smooth muscle to some degree, skeletal muscle completely
depends on signaling from the nervous system to work properly. On the other hand, both cardiac muscle and smooth muscle
can respond to other stimuli, such as hormones and local stimuli.

Figure 10.2 The Three Types of Muscle Tissue The body contains three types of muscle tissue: (a) skeletal muscle,
(b) smooth muscle, and (c) cardiac muscle. From top, LM x 1600, LM x 1600, LM x 1600. (Micrographs provided by

 The muscles all begin the actual process of contracting (shortening) when a protein called actin is pulled by a protein
called myosin. This occurs in striated muscle (skeletal and cardiac) after specific binding sites on the actin have been

exposed in response to the interaction between calcium ions (Ca*") and proteins (troponin and tropomyosin) that “shield”

the actin-binding sites.
