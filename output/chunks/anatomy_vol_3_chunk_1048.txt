These actions block off the air passages. 40 If the lower esophageal sphincter does not
close completely, the stomachâ€™s acidic contents can back up into the esophagus, a phenomenon known as GERD. 41 Peristalsis
moves the bolus down the esophagus and toward the stomach. Esophageal glands secrete mucus that lubricates the bolus and
reduces friction. When the bolus nears the stomach, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing the bolus to pass into the
stomach. 42 The mucosal barrier protects the stomach from self-digestion. It includes a thick coating of bicarbonate-rich mucus;
the mucus is physically protective, and bicarbonate neutralizes gastric acid. Epithelial cells meet at tight junctions, which block
gastric juice from penetrating the underlying tissue layers, and stem cells quickly replace sloughed off epithelial mucosal cells. 43
The stomach has an additional inner oblique smooth muscle layer that helps the muscularis churn and mix food. The epithelium
includes gastric glands that secrete gastric fluid. The gastric fluid consists mainly of mucous, HCl, and the enzyme pepsin released
as pepsinogen.
