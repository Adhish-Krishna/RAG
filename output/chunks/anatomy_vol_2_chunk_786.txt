The person may also experience persistent hunger because the body cells are unable
to access the glucose in the bloodstream.

 Over time, persistently high levels of glucose in the blood injure tissues throughout the body, especially those of
the blood vessels and nerves. Inflammation and injury of the lining of arteries lead to atherosclerosis and an increased
risk of heart attack and stroke. Damage to the microscopic blood vessels of the kidney impairs kidney function and
can lead to kidney failure. Damage to blood vessels that serve the eyes can lead to blindness. Blood vessel damage
also reduces circulation to the limbs, whereas nerve damage leads to a loss of sensation, called neuropathy, particularly
in the hands and feet. Together, these changes increase the risk of injury, infection, and tissue death (necrosis),
contributing to a high rate of toe, foot, and lower leg amputations in people with diabetes.
