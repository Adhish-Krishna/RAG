Innervating the Urinary System

Ureters

The kidneys and ureters are completely retroperitoneal, and the bladder has a peritoneal covering only over the dome. As
urine is formed, it drains into the calyces of the kidney, which merge to form the funnel-shaped renal pelvis in the hilum
of each kidney. The hilum narrows to become the ureter of each kidney. As urine passes through the ureter, it does not
passively drain into the bladder but rather is propelled by waves of peristalsis. As the ureters enter the pelvis, they sweep
laterally, hugging the pelvic walls. As they approach the bladder, they turn medially and pierce the bladder wall obliquely.
 This is important because it creates an one-way valve (a physiological sphincter rather than an anatomical sphincter) that
allows urine into the bladder but prevents reflux of urine from the bladder back into the ureter.
