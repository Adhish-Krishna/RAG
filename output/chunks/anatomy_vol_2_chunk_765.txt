In post-menopausal women, as the functions of the ovaries
decline, the main source of estrogens becomes the androgens produced by the zona reticularis.

 Adrenal Medulla

As noted earlier, the adrenal cortex releases glucocorticoids in response to long-term stress such as severe illness. In
contrast, the adrenal medulla releases its hormones in response to acute, short-term stress mediated by the sympathetic
nervous system (SNS).

 The medullary tissue is composed of unique postganglionic SNS neurons called chromaffin cells, which are large
and irregularly shaped, and produce the neurotransmitters epinephrine (also called adrenaline) and norepinephrine (or
noradrenaline). Epinephrine is produced in greater quantities—approximately a 4 to 1 ratio with norepinephrine—and is the
more powerful hormone. Because the chromaffin cells release epinephrine and norepinephrine into the systemic circulation,
where they travel widely and exert effects on distant cells, they are considered hormones.
