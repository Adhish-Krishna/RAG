There are some differences between the two, but for our purposes here there will be a good bit of
overlap. See Figure 12.6 for examples of where these divisions of the nervous system can be found.

 Brain (CNS)
Perception and processing of sensory
stimuli (somatic/autonomic)
Execution of voluntary motor
responses (somatic)
Regulation of homeostatic
mechanisms (autonomic)

Spinal cord (CNS)

Initiation of reflexes from ventral
horn (somatic) and lateral horn
(autonomic) gray matter

Pathways for sensory and motor
functions between periphery
and brain (somatic/autonomic)

Nerves (PNS)
Fibers of sensory and motor
neurons (somatic/autonomic)

Ganglia (PNS)

Reception of sensory stimuli by
dorsal root and cranial ganglia
(somatic/autonomic)

Relay of visceral motor responses

Digestive tract (ENS) by autonomic ganglia (autonomic)

The enteric nervous system
(ENS), located in the digestive
tract, is responsible for autonomous
functions and can operate independently
of the brain and spinal cord.
