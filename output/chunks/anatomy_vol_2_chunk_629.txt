From the initial neural tube early in embryonic development, the spinal cord retains a
tube-like structure with gray matter surrounding the small central canal and white matter on the surface in three columns.
 The dorsal, or posterior, horns of the gray matter are mainly devoted to sensory functions whereas the ventral, or anterior,
and lateral horns are associated with motor functions. In the white matter, the dorsal column relays sensory information to
the brain, and the anterior column is almost exclusively relaying motor commands to the ventral horn motor neurons. The
lateral column, however, conveys both sensory and motor information between the spinal cord and brain.

The general senses are distributed throughout the body, relying on nervous tissue incorporated into various organs.
