The different modes of barrier defenses are associated with the external surfaces of the body, where pathogens may
try to enter (Table 21.2). The primary barrier to the entrance of microorganisms into the body is the skin. Not only is the
skin covered with a layer of dead, keratinized epithelium that is too dry for bacteria in which to grow, but as these cells are
continuously sloughed off from the skin, they carry bacteria and other pathogens with them. Additionally, sweat and other
skin secretions may lower pH, contain toxic lipids, and physically wash microbes away.

Another barrier is the saliva in the mouth, which is rich in lysozymeâ€”an enzyme that destroys bacteria by digesting
their cell walls.
