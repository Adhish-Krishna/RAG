Exocrine Glands

Exocrine glands release their contents through a duct that leads to the epithelial surface. Mucous, sweat, saliva, and breast
milk are all examples of secretions from exocrine glands. They are all discharged through tubular ducts. Secretions into the
lumen of the gastrointestinal tract, technically outside of the body, are of the exocrine category.

 Glandular Structure

Exocrine glands are classified as either unicellular or multicellular. The unicellular glands are scattered single cells, such as
goblet cells, found in the mucous membranes of the small and large intestine.

 The multicellular exocrine glands known as serous glands develop from simple epithelium to form a secretory surface
that secretes directly into an inner cavity. These glands line the internal cavities of the abdomen and chest and release their
secretions directly into the cavities. Other multicellular exocrine glands release their contents through a tubular duct. The
duct is single in a simple gland but in compound glands is divided into one or more branches (Figure 4.9).
