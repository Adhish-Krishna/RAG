The submucosa of the duodenum is the only site of the complex mucus-secreting duodenal glands (Brunnerâ€™s glands),
which produce a bicarbonate-rich alkaline mucus that buffers the acidic chyme as it enters from the stomach.

 The roles of the cells in the small intestinal mucosa are detailed in Table 23.7.
