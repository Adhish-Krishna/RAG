Because there is less
circulating protein, principally albumin, the osmotic pressure of the blood falls. Less osmotic pressure pulling water into the
capillaries tips the balance towards hydrostatic pressure, which tends to push it out of the capillaries. The net effect is that
water is lost from the circulation to interstitial tissues and cells. This “plumps up” the tissues and cells, a condition termed
systemic edema.

 Net Filtration Pressure (NFP)

NFP determines filtration rates through the kidney. It is determined as follows:

FP = Glomerular blood hydrostatic pressure (GBHP) — [capsular hydrostatic pressure (CHP) + blood colloid osmotic
pressure (BCOP)] = 10 mm Hg
That is:
FP = GBHP — [CHP + BCOP] = 10 mm Hg
Or:
FP = 55 — [15 + 30] = 10 mm Hg

As you can see, there is a low net pressure across the filtration membrane.
