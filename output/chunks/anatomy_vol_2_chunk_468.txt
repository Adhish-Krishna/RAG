These molecules are exogenous, meaning that they are made outside of the human body, so a researcher can use them
without any confounding endogenous results (results caused by the molecules produced in the body).

 The adrenergic system also has two types of receptors, named the alpha (a)-adrenergic receptor and beta (B)-
adrenergic receptor. Unlike cholinergic receptors, these receptor types are not classified by which drugs can bind to them.
 All of them are G protein-coupled receptors. There are three types of a-adrenergic receptors, termed a1, «2, and a3, and
there are two types of B-adrenergic receptors, termed 81 and B2. An additional aspect of the adrenergic system is that there
is a second signaling molecule called epinephrine. The chemical difference between norepinephrine and epinephrine is the
addition of a methyl group (CH3) in epinephrine. The prefix “nor-” actually refers to this chemical difference, in which a
methyl group is missing.
