Organ capsules (collagenous type) and walls of arteries (elastic type) contain dense irregular connective tissue. Cartilage
and bone are supportive tissue. Cartilage contains chondrocytes and is somewhat flexible. Hyaline cartilage is smooth and
clear, covers joints, and is found in the growing portion of bones. Fibrocartilage is tough because of extra collagen fibers
and forms, among other things, the intervertebral discs. Elastic cartilage can stretch and recoil to its original shape because
of its high content of elastic fibers. The matrix contains very few blood vessels. Bones are made of a rigid, mineralized
matrix containing calcium salts, crystals, and osteocytes lodged in lacunae. Bone tissue is highly vascularized. Cancellous
bone is spongy and less solid than compact bone. Fluid tissue, for example blood and lymph, is characterized by a liquid
matrix and no supporting fibers.

The three types of muscle cells are skeletal, cardiac, and smooth.
