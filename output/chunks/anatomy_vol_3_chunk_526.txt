Autoregulation

The kidneys are very effective at regulating the rate of blood flow over a wide range of blood pressures. Your blood pressure
will decrease when you are relaxed or sleeping. It will increase when exercising. Yet, despite these changes, the filtration
rate through the kidney will change very little. This is due to two internal autoregulatory mechanisms that operate without
outside influence: the myogenic mechanism and the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism.

 Arteriole Myogenic Mechanism

The myogenic mechanism regulating blood flow within the kidney depends upon a characteristic shared by most smooth
muscle cells of the body. When you stretch a smooth muscle cell, it contracts; when you stop, it relaxes, restoring its resting
length. This mechanism works in the afferent arteriole that supplies the glomerulus. When blood pressure increases, smooth
muscle cells in the wall of the arteriole are stretched and respond by contracting to resist the pressure, resulting in little
change in flow.
