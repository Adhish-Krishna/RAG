Most chemical hair removers also act superficially; however, electrolysis and yanking both attempt to
destroy the hair bulb so hair cannot grow.

Figure 5.12 Hair Follicle The slide shows a cross-section of a hair follicle. Basal cells of the hair matrix in the center
differentiate into cells of the inner root sheath. Basal cells at the base of the hair root form the outer root sheath. LM x

The wall of the hair follicle is made of three concentric layers of cells. The cells of the internal root sheath surround
the root of the growing hair and extend just up to the hair shaft. They are derived from the basal cells of the hair matrix. The
external root sheath, which is an extension of the epidermis, encloses the hair root. It is made of basal cells at the base of
the hair root and tends to be more keratinous in the upper regions.
