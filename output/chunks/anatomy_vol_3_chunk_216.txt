the pyloric antrum, connects to the body of the stomach. The narrower end is called the pyloric canal, which connects
to the duodenum. The smooth muscle pyloric sphincter is located at this latter point of connection and controls stomach
emptying. In the absence of food, the stomach deflates inward, and its mucosa and submucosa fall into a large fold called a

ruga.

Figure 23.15 Stomach The stomach has four major regions: the cardia, fundus, body, and pylorus. The addition of
an inner oblique smooth muscle layer gives the muscularis the ability to vigorously churn and mix food.

 The convex lateral surface of the stomach is called the greater curvature; the concave medial border is the lesser
curvature.
