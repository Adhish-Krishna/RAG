This is also referred to as humoral (body fluid) immunity. T cells provide cellular-level immunity by physically
attacking foreign or diseased cells. A memory cell is a variety of both B and T cells that forms after exposure to a pathogen
and mounts rapid responses upon subsequent exposures. Unlike other leukocytes, memory cells live for many years. B
cells undergo a maturation process in the bone marrow, whereas T cells undergo maturation in the thymus. This site of the
maturation process gives rise to the name B and T cells. The functions of lymphocytes are complex and will be covered in
detail in the chapter covering the lymphatic system and immunity. Smaller lymphocytes are either B or T cells, although
they cannot be differentiated in a normal blood smear.

 Abnormally high lymphocyte counts are characteristic of viral infections as well as some types of cancer. Abnormally
low lymphocyte counts are characteristic of prolonged (chronic) illness or immunosuppression, including that caused by
HIV infection and drug therapies that often involve steroids.
