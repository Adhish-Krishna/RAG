This is a loose connective tissue that consists of fat cells with little extracellular matrix. It
stores fat for energy and provides insulation. LM x 800. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan

Areolar tissue shows little specialization. It contains all the cell types and fibers previously described and is distributed
in a random, web-like fashion. It fills the spaces between muscle fibers, surrounds blood and lymph vessels, and supports
organs in the abdominal cavity. Areolar tissue underlies most epithelia and represents the connective tissue component of
epithelial membranes, which are described further in a later section.

 Reticular tissue is a mesh-like, supportive framework for soft organs such as lymphatic tissue, the spleen, and the liver
(Figure 4.14). Reticular cells produce the reticular fibers that form the network onto which other cells attach. It derives its
name from the Latin reticulus, which means “little net.”
