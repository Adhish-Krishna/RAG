The acidic environment of the stomach, which is fatal to many pathogens, is also a barrier. Additionally,
the mucus layer of the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, reproductive tract, eyes, ears, and nose traps both microbes
and debris, and facilitates their removal. In the case of the upper respiratory tract, ciliated epithelial cells move potentially
contaminated mucus upwards to the mouth, where it is then swallowed into the digestive tract, ending up in the harsh acidic
environment of the stomach. Considering how often you breathe compared to how often you eat or perform other activities
that expose you to pathogens, it is not surprising that multiple barrier mechanisms have evolved to work in concert to protect
this vital area.

 Cells of the Innate Immune Response

A phagocyte is a cell that is able to surround and engulf a particle or cell, a process called phagocytosis. The phagocytes of
the immune system engulf other particles or cells, either to clean an area of debris, old cells, or to kill pathogenic organisms
such as bacteria.
