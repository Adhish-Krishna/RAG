Another example is the treatment
of anaerobic bacterial infections, which are created by bacteria that cannot or prefer not to live in the presence of
oxygen. An increase in blood and tissue levels of oxygen helps to kill the anaerobic bacteria that are responsible for
the infection, as oxygen is toxic to anaerobic bacteria. For wounds and grafts, the chamber stimulates the healing
process by increasing energy production needed for repair. Increasing oxygen transport allows cells to ramp up cellular
respiration and thus ATP production, the energy needed to build new structures.

CHAPTER 22 | THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 1001

The other major activity in the lungs is the process of respiration, the process of gas exchange.
