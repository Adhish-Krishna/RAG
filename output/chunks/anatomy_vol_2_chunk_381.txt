The thalamus is a collection of several nuclei that can be categorized into three anatomical groups. White matter
running through the thalamus defines the three major regions of the thalamus, which are an anterior nucleus, a medial
nucleus, and a lateral group of nuclei. The anterior nucleus serves as a relay between the hypothalamus and the emotion
and memory-producing limbic system. The medial nuclei serve as a relay for information from the limbic system and basal
ganglia to the cerebral cortex. This allows memory creation during learning, but also determines alertness. The special and
somatic senses connect to the lateral nuclei, where their information is relayed to the appropriate sensory cortex of the
cerebrum.

 Cortical Processing

As described earlier, many of the sensory axons are positioned in the same way as their corresponding receptor cells in the
body. This allows identification of the position of a stimulus on the basis of which receptor cells are sending information.
