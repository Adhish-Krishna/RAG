Excess glucose is either stored as an energy
reserve in the liver and skeletal muscles as the complex polymer glycogen, or it is converted into fat (triglyceride) in adipose
cells (adipocytes).

 Among the lipids (fats), triglycerides are most often used for energy via a metabolic process called B-oxidation. About
one-half of excess fat is stored in adipocytes that accumulate in the subcutaneous tissue under the skin, whereas the rest is
stored in adipocytes in other tissues and organs.

 Proteins, which are polymers, can be broken down into their monomers, individual amino acids. Amino acids can be
used as building blocks of new proteins or broken down further for the production of ATP. When one is chronically starving,
this use of amino acids for energy production can lead to a wasting away of the body, as more and more proteins are broken
down.
