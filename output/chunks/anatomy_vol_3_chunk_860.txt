CHAPTER 28 | DEVELOPMENT AND INHERITANCE 1269

Lactation is the process by which milk is synthesized and secreted from the mammary glands of the postpartum female
breast in response to an infant sucking at the nipple. Breast milk provides ideal nutrition and passive immunity for the
infant, encourages mild uterine contractions to return the uterus to its pre-pregnancy size (i.e., involution), and induces a
substantial metabolic increase in the mother, consuming the fat reserves stored during pregnancy.
