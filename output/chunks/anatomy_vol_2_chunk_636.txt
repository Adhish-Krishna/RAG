If one side is
not perceived, this may indicate damage to the contralateral posterior parietal lobe. Because there is one of each pathway
on either side of the spinal cord, they are not likely to interact. If none of the other subtests suggest particular deficits with
the pathways, the deficit is likely to be in the cortex where conscious perception is based. The mental status exam contains
subtests that assess other functions that are primarily localized to the parietal cortex, such as stereognosis and graphesthesia.

 A final subtest of sensory perception that concentrates on the sense of proprioception is known as the Romberg test.
 The patient is asked to stand straight with feet together. Once the patient has achieved their balance in that position, they
are asked to close their eyes. Without visual feedback that the body is in a vertical orientation relative to the surrounding
environment, the patient must rely on the proprioceptive stimuli of joint and muscle position, as well as information from the
inner ear, to maintain balance.
