Each tooth is anchored into a deep socket called an alveolus. On the anterior maxilla, just below the
orbit, is the infraorbital foramen. This is the point of exit for a sensory nerve that supplies the nose, upper lip, and anterior
cheek. On the inferior skull, the palatine process from each maxillary bone can be seen joining together at the midline to
form the anterior three-quarters of the hard palate (see Figure 7.8a). The hard palate is the bony plate that forms the roof
of the mouth and floor of the nasal cavity, separating the oral and nasal cavities.

Figure 7.14 Maxillary Bone The maxillary bone forms the upper jaw and supports the upper teeth. Each maxilla also
forms the lateral floor of each orbit and the majority of the hard palate.
