The components of the immune response that have the maximum effectiveness against a pathogen are often
associated with the class of pathogen involved. Bacteria and fungi are especially susceptible to damage by complement
proteins, whereas viruses are taken care of by interferons and cytotoxic T cells. Worms are attacked by eosinophils.
 Pathogens have shown the ability, however, to evade the body’s immune responses, some leading to chronic infections or
even death. The immune system and pathogens are in a slow, evolutionary race to see who stays on top. Modern medicine,
hopefully, will keep the results skewed in humans’ favor.

21.6 Diseases Associated with Depressed or Overactive Immune Responses

The immune response can be under-reactive or over-reactive. Suppressed immunity can result from inherited genetic defects
or by acquiring viruses. Over-reactive immune responses include the hypersensitivities: B cell- and T cell-mediated immune
responses designed to control pathogens, but that lead to symptoms or medical complications.
