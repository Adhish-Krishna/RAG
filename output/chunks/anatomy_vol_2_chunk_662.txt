When the cerebellum is compromised by alcohol, the cerebellum cannot coordinate these movements effectively,
and maintaining balance becomes difficult.

 Another common aspect of the FST is to have the driver extend their arms out wide and touch their fingertip to
their nose, usually with their eyes closed. The point of this is to remove the visual feedback for the movement and
force the driver to rely just on proprioceptive information about the movement and position of their fingertip relative
to their nose. With eyes open, the corrections to the movement of the arm might be so small as to be hard to see, but
proprioceptive feedback is not as immediate and broader movements of the arm will probably be needed, particularly
if the cerebellum is affected by alcohol.

 Reciting the alphabet backwards is not always a component of the FST, but its relationship to neurological
function is interesting. There is a cognitive aspect to remembering how the alphabet goes and how to recite it
backwards.
