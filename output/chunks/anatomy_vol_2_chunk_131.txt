Figure 12.27 The Synapse The synapse is a connection between a neuron and its target cell (which is not
necessarily a neuron). The presynaptic element is the synaptic end bulb of the axon where Ca** enters the bulb to
cause vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release. The neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft to bind to
its receptor. The neurotransmitter is cleared from the synapse either by enzymatic degradation, neuronal reuptake, or
glial reuptake.

 Neurotransmitter Systems

 There are several systems of neurotransmitters that are found at various synapses in the nervous system. These groups refer
to the chemicals that are the neurotransmitters, and within the groups are specific systems.

 The first group, which is a neurotransmitter system of its own, is the cholinergic system. It is the system based on
acetylcholine. This includes the NMJ as an example of a cholinergic synapse, but cholinergic synapses are found in other
parts of the nervous system.
