CHAPTER 4| THE TISSUE LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION 165

myelin layer of lipid inside some neuroglial cells that wraps around the axons of some neurons

myocyte muscle cells

necrosis accidental death of cells and tissues

nervous tissue type of tissue that is capable of sending and receiving impulses through electrochemical signals.
 neuroglia supportive neural cells

neuron excitable neural cell that transfer nerve impulses

oligodendrocyte neuroglial cell that produces myelin in the brain

parenchyma functional cells of a gland or organ, in contrast with the supportive or connective tissue of a gland or
organ

primary union edges of a wound are close enough together to promote healing without the use of stitches to hold them
close

pseudostratified columnar epithelium tissue that consists of a single layer of irregularly shaped and sized cells
that give the appearance of multiple layers; found in ducts of certain glands and the upper respiratory tract

reticular fiber fine fibrous protein, made of collagen subunits, which cross-link to form supporting “nets” within
connective tissue

reticular lamina matrix containing collagen and elastin secreted by connective tissue; a component of the basement
membrane

reticular tissue type of loose connective tissue that provides a supportive framework to soft organs, such as lymphatic
tissue, spleen, and the liver

Schwann cell neuroglial cell that produces myelin in the peripheral nervous system

secondary union wound healing facilitated by wound contraction

serous gland group of cells within the serous membrane that secrete a lubricating substance onto the surface
serous membrane type of tissue membrane that lines body cavities and lubricates them with serous fluid

simple columnar epithelium tissue that consists of a single layer of column-like cells; promotes secretion and
absorption in tissues and organs

simple cuboidal epithelium tissue that consists of a single layer of cube-shaped cells; promotes secretion and
absorption in ducts and tubules

simple squamous epithelium tissue that consists of a single layer of flat scale-like cells; promotes diffusion and
filtration across surface

skeletal muscle usually attached to bone, under voluntary control, each cell is a fiber that is multinucleated and
striated

smooth muscle under involuntary control, moves internal organs, cells contain a single nucleus, are spindle-shaped,
and do not appear striated; each cell is a fiber

stratified columnar epithelium tissue that consists of two or more layers of column-like cells, contains glands and is
found in some ducts

stratified cuboidal epithelium tissue that consists of two or more layers of cube-shaped cells, found in some ducts

stratified squamous epithelium tissue that consists of multiple layers of cells with the most apical being flat scale-
like cells; protects surfaces from abrasion

striation alignment of parallel actin and myosin filaments which form a banded pattern

supportive connective tissue type of connective tissue that provides strength to the body and protects soft tissue

166 CHAPTER 4| THE TISSUE LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION

synovial membrane connective tissue membrane that lines the cavities of freely movable joints, producing synovial
fluid for lubrication

tight junction forms an impermeable barrier between cells

tissue membrane thin layer or sheet of cells that covers the outside of the body, organs, and internal cavities
tissue group of cells that are similar in form and perform related functions

totipotent embryonic cells that have the ability to differentiate into any type of cell and organ in the body

transitional epithelium form of stratified epithelium found in the urinary tract, characterized by an apical layer of
cells that change shape in response to the presence of urine

vasodilation widening of blood vessels

wound contraction process whereby the borders of a wound are physically drawn together

CHAPTER REVIEW

4.1 Types of Tissues

The human body contains more than 200 types of cells that can all be classified into four types of tissues: epithelial,
connective, muscle, and nervous.
