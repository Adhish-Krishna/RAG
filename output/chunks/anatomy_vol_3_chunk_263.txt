Of every 500
mL (17 ounces) of food residue that enters the cecum each day, about 150 mL (5 ounces) become feces.

 Feces are eliminated through contractions of the rectal muscles. You help this process by a voluntary procedure called
Valsalvaâ€™s maneuver, in which you increase intra-abdominal pressure by contracting your diaphragm and abdominal wall
muscles, and closing your glottis.
 The process of defecation begins when mass movements force feces from the colon into the rectum, stretching the
rectal wall and provoking the defecation reflex, which eliminates feces from the rectum. This parasympathetic reflex is
mediated by the spinal cord. It contracts the sigmoid colon and rectum, relaxes the internal anal sphincter, and initially
contracts the external anal sphincter. The presence of feces in the anal canal sends a signal to the brain, which gives you
the choice of voluntarily opening the external anal sphincter (defecating) or keeping it temporarily closed.
