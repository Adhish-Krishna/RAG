When capacitated sperm make contact with the oocyte, they release the digestive enzymes in the acrosome (the acrosomal
reaction) and are thus able to attach to the oocyte and burrow through to the oocyte’s zona pellucida. One of the sperm
will then break through to the oocyte’s plasma membrane and release its haploid nucleus into the oocyte. The oocyte’s

membrane structure changes in response (cortical reaction), preventing any further penetration by another sperm and
forming a fertilization membrane. Fertilization is complete upon unification of the haploid nuclei of the two gametes,
producing a diploid zygote.

28.2 Embryonic Development

As the zygote travels toward the uterus, it undergoes numerous cleavages in which the number of cells doubles
(blastomeres). Upon reaching the uterus, the conceptus has become a tightly packed sphere of cells called the morula, which
then forms into a blastocyst consisting of an inner cell mass within a fluid-filled cavity surrounded by trophoblasts.
