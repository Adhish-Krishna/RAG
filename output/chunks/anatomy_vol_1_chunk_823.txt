Because the hips are wider than the knee region, the femur has a diagonal orientation within the thigh, in contrast
to the vertically oriented tibia of the leg (Figure 8.17). The Q-angle is a measure of how far the femur is angled
laterally away from vertical. The Q-angle is normally 10-15 degrees, with females typically having a larger Q-angle
due to their wider pelvis. During extension of the knee, the quadriceps femoris muscle pulls the patella both superiorly
and laterally, with the lateral pull greater in women due to their large Q-angle. This makes women more vulnerable to
developing patellofemoral syndrome than men. Normally, the large lip on the lateral side of the patellar surface of the
femur compensates for the lateral pull on the patella, and thus helps to maintain its proper tracking.
