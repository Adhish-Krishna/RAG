Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is produced by bone cells in response

to increased blood levels of vitamin D3 or phosphate. It triggers the kidneys to inhibit the formation of calcitriol from
vitamin D3 and to increase phosphorus excretion. Osteocalcin, produced by osteoblasts, stimulates the pancreatic beta cells
to increase insulin production. It also acts on peripheral tissues to increase their sensitivity to insulin and their utilization of
glucose.

 Adipose Tissue

Adipose tissue produces and secretes several hormones involved in lipid metabolism and storage. One important example is
leptin, a protein manufactured by adipose cells that circulates in amounts directly proportional to levels of body fat. Leptin
is released in response to food consumption and acts by binding to brain neurons involved in energy intake and expenditure.
 Binding of leptin produces a feeling of satiety after a meal, thereby reducing appetite. It also appears that the binding of
leptin to brain receptors triggers the sympathetic nervous system to regulate bone metabolism, increasing deposition of
cortical bone.
