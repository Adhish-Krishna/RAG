Second-hand smoke, which is a combination of sidestream smoke and the mainstream smoke that is exhaled
by the smoker, has been demonstrated by numerous scientific studies to cause disease. At least 40 chemicals in
sidestream smoke have been identified that negatively impact human health, leading to the development of cancer
or other conditions, such as immune system dysfunction, liver toxicity, cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, and
neurological dysfunction. Furthermore, second-hand smoke has been found to harbor at least 250 compounds that are
known to be toxic, carcinogenic, or both. Some major classes of carcinogens in second-hand smoke are polyaromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), N-nitrosamines, aromatic amines, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde.

 Tobacco and second-hand smoke are considered to be carcinogenic. Exposure to second-hand smoke can cause
lung cancer in individuals who are not tobacco users themselves. It is estimated that the risk of developing lung
cancer is increased by up to 30 percent in nonsmokers who live with an individual who smokes in the house, as
compared to nonsmokers who are not regularly exposed to second-hand smoke.
