Joints are the location where bones come together. Many joints allow for movement between the
bones. At these joints, the articulating surfaces of the adjacent bones can move smoothly against each other. However, the
bones of other joints may be joined to each other by connective tissue or cartilage. These joints are designed for stability
and provide for little or no movement. Importantly, joint stability and movement are related to each other. This means that
stable joints allow for little or no mobility between the adjacent bones. Conversely, joints that provide the most movement
between bones are the least stable. Understanding the relationship between joint structure and function will help to explain
why particular types of joints are found in certain areas of the body.


330 CHAPTER 9 | JOINTS

The articulating surfaces of bones at stable types of joints, with little or no mobility, are strongly united to each other.
