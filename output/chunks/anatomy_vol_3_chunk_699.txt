The Bartholin’s glands and the lesser vestibular glands (located
near the clitoris) secrete mucus, which keeps the vestibular area moist.

 The vagina is home to a normal population of microorganisms that help to protect against infection by pathogenic
bacteria, yeast, or other organisms that can enter the vagina. In a healthy woman, the most predominant type of vagina
bacteria is from the genus Lactobacillus. This family of beneficial bacterial flora secretes lactic acid, and thus protects the
vagina by maintaining an acidic pH (below 4.5). Potential pathogens are less likely to survive in these acidic conditions.
 Lactic acid, in combination with other vaginal secretions, makes the vagina a self-cleansing organ. However, douching—or
washing out the vagina with fluid—can disrupt the normal balance of healthy microorganisms, and actually increase a
woman’s risk for infections and irritation.
