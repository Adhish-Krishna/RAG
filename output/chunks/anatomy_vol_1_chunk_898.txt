Outside of their articulating surfaces, the bones are connected together by ligaments, which are strong bands of fibrous
connective tissue. These strengthen and support the joint by anchoring the bones together and preventing their separation.
 Ligaments allow for normal movements at a joint, but limit the range of these motions, thus preventing excessive or
abnormal joint movements. Ligaments are classified based on their relationship to the fibrous articular capsule. An extrinsic
ligament is located outside of the articular capsule, an intrinsic ligament is fused to or incorporated into the wall of the
articular capsule, and an intracapsular ligament is located inside of the articular capsule.

 At many synovial joints, additional support is provided by the muscles and their tendons that act across the joint. A
tendon is the dense connective tissue structure that attaches a muscle to bone. As forces acting on a joint increase, the
body will automatically increase the overall strength of contraction of the muscles crossing that joint, thus allowing the
muscle and its tendon to serve as a “dynamic ligament” to resist forces and support the joint.
