Almost 100 percent of glucose, amino acids, and other organic substances such as vitamins are normally
recovered here. Some glucose may appear in the urine if circulating glucose levels are high enough that all the glucose
transporters in the PCT are saturated, so that their capacity to move glucose is exceeded (transport maximum, or Tym). In
men, the maximum amount of glucose that can be recovered is about 375 mg/min, whereas in women, it is about 300 mg/
min. This recovery rate translates to an arterial concentration of about 200 mg/dL. Though an exceptionally high sugar
intake might cause sugar to appear briefly in the urine, the appearance of glycosuria usually points to type I or II diabetes
mellitus. The transport of glucose from the lumen of the PCT to the interstitial space is similar to the way it is absorbed
by the small intestine. Both glucose and Na‚Äù bind simultaneously to the same symport proteins on the apical surface of
the cell to be transported in the same direction, toward the interstitial space.
