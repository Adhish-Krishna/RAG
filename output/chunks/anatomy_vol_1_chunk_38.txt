For example, a systemic anatomical study of the muscular system would consider all of the skeletal muscles
of the body.

 Whereas anatomy is about structure, physiology is about function. Human physiology is the scientific study of the
chemistry and physics of the structures of the body and the ways in which they work together to support the functions

of life. Much of the study of physiology centers on the bodyâ€™s tendency toward homeostasis. Homeostasis is the state of
steady internal conditions maintained by living things. The study of physiology certainly includes observation, both with
the naked eye and with microscopes, as well as manipulations and measurements. However, current advances in physiology
usually depend on carefully designed laboratory experiments that reveal the functions of the many structures and chemical
compounds that make up the human body.
