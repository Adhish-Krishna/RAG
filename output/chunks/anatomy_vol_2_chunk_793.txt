Adiponectin—another hormone synthesized by adipose cells—appears to reduce cellular insulin resistance
and to protect blood vessels from inflammation and atherosclerosis. Its levels are lower in people who are obese, and rise
following weight loss.

 Skin

The skin functions as an endocrine organ in the production of the inactive form of vitamin D3, cholecalciferol. When
cholesterol present in the epidermis is exposed to ultraviolet radiation, it is converted to cholecalciferol, which then enters
the blood. In the liver, cholecalciferol is converted to an intermediate that travels to the kidneys and is further converted to
calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D3. Vitamin D is important in a variety of physiological processes, including intestinal
calcium absorption and immune system function. In some studies, low levels of vitamin D have been associated with
increased risks of cancer, severe asthma, and multiple sclerosis. Vitamin D deficiency in children causes rickets, and in
adults, osteomalacia—both of which are characterized by bone deterioration.
