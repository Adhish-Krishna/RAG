Although electrons do not follow rigid orbits a set distance away from the atomâ€™s nucleus, they do tend to stay within
certain regions of space called electron shells. An electron shell is a layer of electrons that encircle the nucleus at a distinct
energy level.

 The atoms of the elements found in the human body have from one to five electron shells, and all electron shells hold
eight electrons except the first shell, which can only hold two. This configuration of electron shells is the same for all atoms.
 The precise number of shells depends on the number of electrons in the atom. Hydrogen and helium have just one and two
electrons, respectively. If you take a look at the periodic table of the elements, you will notice that hydrogen and helium
are placed alone on either sides of the top row; they are the only elements that have just one electron shell (Figure 2.7).
