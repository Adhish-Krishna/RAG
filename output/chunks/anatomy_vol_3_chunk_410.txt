CHAPTER 24 | METABOLISM AND NUTRITION 1115

Vitamins

Vitamins are organic compounds found in foods and are a necessary part of the biochemical reactions in the body. They
are involved in a number of processes, including mineral and bone metabolism, and cell and tissue growth, and they act as
cofactors for energy metabolism. The B vitamins play the largest role of any vitamins in metabolism (Table 24.3 and Table
24.4).

 You get most of your vitamins through your diet, although some can be formed from the precursors absorbed during
digestion. For example, the body synthesizes vitamin A from the B-carotene in orange vegetables like carrots and sweet
potatoes. Vitamins are either fat-soluble or water-soluble. Fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K, are absorbed through the
intestinal tract with lipids in chylomicrons.
