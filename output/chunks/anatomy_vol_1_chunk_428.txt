It provides protection to internal organs and supports the body. Boneâ€™s rigid
extracellular matrix contains mostly collagen fibers embedded in a mineralized ground substance containing
hydroxyapatite, a form of calcium phosphate. Both components of the matrix, organic and inorganic, contribute to the
unusual properties of bone. Without collagen, bones would be brittle and shatter easily. Without mineral crystals, bones
would flex and provide little support. Osteocytes, bone cells like chondrocytes, are located within lacunae. The histology

of transverse tissue from long bone shows a typical arrangement of osteocytes in concentric circles around a central canal.
 Bone is a highly vascularized tissue. Unlike cartilage, bone tissue can recover from injuries in a relatively short time.

 Cancellous bone looks like a sponge under the microscope and contains empty spaces between trabeculae, or arches of
bone proper. It is lighter than compact bone and found in the interior of some bones and at the end of long bones.
