All
of these rapid alternations require planning from the cerebrocerebellum to coordinate movement commands that control the
coordination.

CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 675

Posture and Gait

Gait can either be considered a separate part of the neurological exam or a subtest of the coordination exam that addresses
walking and balance. Testing posture and gait addresses functions of the spinocerebellum and the vestibulocerebellum
because both are part of these activities. A subtest called station begins with the patient standing in a normal position to
check for the placement of the feet and balance. The patient is asked to hop on one foot to assess the ability to maintain
balance and posture during movement. Though the station subtest appears to be similar to the Romberg test, the difference
is that the patientâ€™s eyes are open during station. The Romberg test has the patient stand still with the eyes closed. Any
changes in posture would be the result of proprioceptive deficits, and the patient is able to recover when they open their
eyes.
