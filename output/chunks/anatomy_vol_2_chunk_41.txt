Terminology applied to bundles of axons also differs depending on location. A bundle of axons, or fibers, found in the
CNS is called a tract whereas the same thing in the PNS would be called a nerve. There is an important point to make
about these terms, which is that they can both be used to refer to the same bundle of axons. When those axons are in the
PNS, the term is nerve, but if they are CNS, the term is tract. The most obvious example of this is the axons that project
from the retina into the brain. Those axons are called the optic nerve as they leave the eye, but when they are inside the
cranium, they are referred to as the optic tract. There is a specific place where the name changes, which is the optic chiasm,
but they are still the same axons (Figure 12.5).
