If diagnosis is late and the uterine tube is already ruptured, surgical repair is essential.

 Even if the embryo has successfully found its way to the uterus, it does not always implant in an optimal location
(the fundus or the posterior wall of the uterus). Placenta previa can result if an embryo implants close to the internal
os of the uterus (the internal opening of the cervix). As the fetus grows, the placenta can partially or completely cover
the opening of the cervix (Figure 28.7). Although it occurs in only 0.5 percent of pregnancies, placenta previa is the
leading cause of antepartum hemorrhage (profuse vaginal bleeding after week 24 of pregnancy but prior to childbirth).
