The margin of the smooth area of the head is the anatomical neck of the humerus.
 Located on the lateral side of the proximal humerus is an expanded bony area called the greater tubercle. The smaller
lesser tubercle of the humerus is found on the anterior aspect of the humerus. Both the greater and lesser tubercles serve as
attachment sites for muscles that act across the shoulder joint. Passing between the greater and lesser tubercles is the narrow
intertubercular groove (sulcus), which is also known as the bicipital groove because it provides passage for a tendon of
the biceps brachii muscle. The surgical neck is located at the base of the expanded, proximal end of the humerus, where
it joins the narrow shaft of the humerus. The surgical neck is a common site of arm fractures. The deltoid tuberosity is
a roughened, V-shaped region located on the lateral side in the middle of the humerus shaft.
