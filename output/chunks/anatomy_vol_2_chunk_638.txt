The corticospinal tract represents the neurons that send output from the primary motor cortex. These
‘ibers travel through the deep white matter of the cerebrum, then through the midbrain and pons, into the medulla where
most of them decussate, and finally through the spinal cord white matter in the lateral (crossed fibers) or anterior (uncrossed
‘ibers) columns. These fibers synapse on motor neurons in the ventral horn. The ventral horn motor neurons then project
to skeletal muscle and cause contraction. These two cells are termed the upper motor neuron (UMN) and the lower motor
neuron (LMN). Voluntary movements require these two cells to be active.

 The motor exam tests the function of these neurons and the muscles they control. First, the muscles are inspected and
palpated for signs of structural irregularities. Movement disorders may be the result of changes to the muscle tissue, such
as scarring, and these possibilities need to be ruled out before testing function.
