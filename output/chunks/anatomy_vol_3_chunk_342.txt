During the energy-releasing phase, the phosphates are removed from
both three-carbon compounds and used to produce four ATP molecules.

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/glycolysis1) to learn about glycolysis.

 Glycolysis can be divided into two phases: energy consuming (also called chemical priming) and energy yielding. The
first phase is the energy-consuming phase, so it requires two ATP molecules to start the reaction for each molecule of
glucose. However, the end of the reaction produces four ATPs, resulting in a net gain of two ATP energy molecules.

 Glycolysis can be expressed as the following equation:

Glucose + 2ATP + 2NADt + 4ADP + 2P; — 2 Pyruvate + 4ATP + 2NADH + 2H*

This equation states that glucose, in combination with ATP (the energy source), NAD* (a coenzyme that serves as an
electron acceptor), and inorganic phosphate, breaks down into two pyruvate molecules, generating four ATP molecules—for
a net yield of two ATP—and two energy-containing NADH coenzymes.
