On either side of the foramen magnum is an oval-shaped occipital condyle. These condyles form joints with the
first cervical vertebra and thus support the skull on top of the vertebral column.

 Sphenoid Bone

The sphenoid bone is a single, complex bone of the central skull (Figure 7.10). It serves as a “keystone” bone, because
it joins with almost every other bone of the skull. The sphenoid forms much of the base of the central skull (see Figure
7.8) and also extends laterally to contribute to the sides of the skull (see Figure 7.5).
