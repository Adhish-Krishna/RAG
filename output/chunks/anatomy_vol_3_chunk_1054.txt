41 The ingestion of food stimulates
digestion and processing of the carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. This breakdown of food triggers glycolysis, the Krebs cycle,
the electron transport chain, fatty acid oxidation, lipogenesis, and amino acid oxidation to produce energy. Heat is a byproduct of
those reactions. 42 Factors that influence weight gain are food intake (both quantity and quality), environmental factors, height,
exercise level, some drugs or disease states, and genes. 43 Although these foods technically do not have fat added, many times a
significant amount of sugar is added to sweeten the food and make it taste better. These foods are non-fat; however, they can lead
to significant fat storage or weight gain because the excess sugar is broken down into pyruvate, but overloads the Krebs cycle.
 When this happens, the sugar is converted into fat through lipogenesis and stored in adipose tissues.
