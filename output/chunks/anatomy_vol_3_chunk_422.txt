24.2 Carbohydrate Metabolism

Metabolic enzymes catalyze catabolic reactions that break down carbohydrates contained in food. The energy released is
used to power the cells and systems that make up your body. Excess or unutilized energy is stored as fat or glycogen for
later use. Carbohydrate metabolism begins in the mouth, where the enzyme salivary amylase begins to break down complex
sugars into monosaccharides. These can then be transported across the intestinal membrane into the bloodstream and then to
body tissues. In the cells, glucose, a six-carbon sugar, is processed through a sequence of reactions into smaller sugars, and
the energy stored inside the molecule is released. The first step of carbohydrate catabolism is glycolysis, which produces
pyruvate, NADH, and ATP. Under anaerobic conditions, the pyruvate can be converted into lactate to keep glycolysis
working. Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate enters the Krebs cycle, also called the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid
