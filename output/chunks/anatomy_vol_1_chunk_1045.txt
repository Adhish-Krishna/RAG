However, if oxygen is not available, pyruvic acid
his conversion allows the recycling of the enzyme

H, which is needed for glycolysis to continue. This occurs during strenuous exercise when high amounts
led but oxygen cannot be sufficiently delivered to muscle. Glycolysis itself cannot be sustained for very

net gain of two ATPs per molecule of glucose, and

lactic acid, which may contribute to muscle fatigue as it accumulates.
 ration is the breakdown of glucose or other nutrients in the presence of oxygen (O2) to produce carbon

producing approximately 36 ATPs per molecule of glucose versus four from glycolysis.
