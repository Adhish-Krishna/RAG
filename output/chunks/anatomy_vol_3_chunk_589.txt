In the body, water moves
by osmosis from plasma to the IF (and the reverse) and from the IF to the ICF (and the reverse). In the body, water moves
constantly into and out of fluid compartments as conditions change in different parts of the body.

 For example, if you are sweating, you will lose water through your skin. Sweating depletes your tissues of water and
increases the solute concentration in those tissues. As this happens, water diffuses from your blood into sweat glands and
surrounding skin tissues that have become dehydrated because of the osmotic gradient. Additionally, as water leaves the
blood, it is replaced by the water in other tissues throughout your body that are not dehydrated. If this continues, dehydration
spreads throughout the body. When a dehydrated person drinks water and rehydrates, the water is redistributed by the same
gradient, but in the opposite direction, replenishing water in all of the tissues.
