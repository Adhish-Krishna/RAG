This is a composite of MRI images taken of the brains of people from 5
years of age through 20 years of age, demonstrating how the cerebrum changes. As the color changes to blue, the ratio
of gray matter to white matter changes. The caption for the video describes it as “less gray matter,” which is another
way of saying “more white matter.” If the brain does not finish developing until approximately 20 years of age, can
teenagers be held responsible for behaving badly?
