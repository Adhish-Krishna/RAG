These curvatures often appear in preteens as the result of poor posture, abnormal growth, or
indeterminate causes. Mostly, they are readily treated by orthopedists. As people age, accumulated spinal column
injuries and diseases like osteoporosis can also lead to curvatures of the spine, hence the stooping you sometimes see
in the elderly.

 Some orthopedists sub-specialize in sports medicine, which addresses both simple injuries, such as a sprained
ankle, and complex injuries, such as a torn rotator cuff in the shoulder. Treatment can range from exercise to surgery.

 Mineral Storage, Energy Storage, and Hematopoiesis

On a metabolic level, bone tissue performs several critical functions. For one, the bone matrix acts as a reservoir for
a number of minerals important to the functioning of the body, especially calcium, and potassium. These minerals,
incorporated into bone tissue, can be released back into the bloodstream to maintain levels needed to support physiological
processes.
