Immune cells present among the skin layers patrol the areas to keep them free of
foreign materials. Fat stores in the hypodermis aid in both thermoregulation and protection. Finally, the skin plays a role in
the synthesis of vitamin D, which is necessary for our well-being but not easily available in natural foods.

5.4 Diseases, Disorders, and Injuries of the Integumentary System

Skin cancer is a result of damage to the DNA of skin cells, often due to excessive exposure to UV radiation. Basal cell
carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are highly curable, and arise from cells in the stratum basale and stratum spinosum,
respectively. Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer, affecting melanocytes, which can spread/metastasize
to other organs. Burns are an injury to the skin that occur as a result of exposure to extreme heat, radiation, or chemicals.
 First-degree and second-degree burns usually heal quickly, but third-degree burns can be fatal because they penetrate the
full thickness of the skin.
