The timing of the menstrual cycle starts with the first day of menses, referred to as day one of a woman’s period. Cycle
length is determined by counting the days between the onset of bleeding in two subsequent cycles. Because the average
length of a woman’s menstrual cycle is 28 days, this is the time period used to identify the timing of events in the cycle.
 However, the length of the menstrual cycle varies among women, and even in the same woman from one cycle to the next,
typically from 21 to 32 days.

 Just as the hormones produced by the granulosa and theca cells of the ovary “drive” the follicular and luteal phases
of the ovarian cycle, they also control the three distinct phases of the menstrual cycle. These are the menses phase, the
proliferative phase, and the secretory phase.

 Menses Phase

The menses phase of the menstrual cycle is the phase during which the lining is shed; that is, the days that the woman
menstruates.
