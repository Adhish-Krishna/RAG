Many of the symptoms are shared with other medical conditions, including anxiety attacks and simple indigestion, so
differential diagnosis is critical. It is estimated that between 22 and 64 percent of MIs present without any symptoms.

 An MI can be confirmed by examining the patientâ€™s ECG, which frequently reveals alterations in the ST and
Q components. Some classification schemes of MI are referred to as ST-elevated MI (STEMI) and non-elevated MI
(non-STEMI). In addition, echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may be employed. Common
blood tests indicating an MI include elevated levels of creatine kinase MB (an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion
of creatine to phosphocreatine, consuming ATP) and cardiac troponin (the regulatory protein for muscle contraction),
both of which are released by damaged cardiac muscle cells.
