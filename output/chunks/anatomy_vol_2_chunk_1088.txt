Higher concentrations of
intracellular calcium ions increase the strength of contraction. Excess calcium (hypercalcemia) also acts as a positive
inotropic agent. The drug digitalis lowers HR and increases the strength of the contraction, acting as a positive inotropic
agent by blocking the sequestering of calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This leads to higher intracellular
calcium levels and greater strength of contraction. In addition to the catecholamines from the adrenal medulla, other
hormones also demonstrate positive inotropic effects. These include thyroid hormones and glucagon from the pancreas.

 Negative inotropic agents include hypoxia, acidosis, hyperkalemia, and a variety of synthetic drugs. These include
numerous beta blockers and calcium channel blockers. Early beta blocker drugs include propranolol and pronethalol, and
are credited with revolutionizing treatment of cardiac patients experiencing angina pectoris. There is also a large class of
dihydropyridine, phenylalkylamine, and benzothiazepine calcium channel blockers that may be administered decreasing the
strength of contraction and SV.

Afterload

Afterload refers to the tension that the ventricles must develop to pump blood effectively against the resistance in the
vascular system.
