Activated vitamin D is important for absorption of

Ca** in the digestive tract, its reabsorption in the kidney, and the maintenance of normal serum concentrations of Ca** and
phosphate. Calcium is vitally important in bone health, muscle contraction, hormone secretion, and neurotransmitter release.
 Inadequate Ca** leads to disorders like osteoporosis and osteomalacia in adults and rickets in children. Deficits may also
result in problems with cell proliferation, neuromuscular function, blood clotting, and the inflammatory response. Recent
research has confirmed that vitamin D receptors are present in most, if not all, cells of the body, reflecting the systemic
importance of vitamin D. Many scientists have suggested it be referred to as a hormone rather than a vitamin.

 Erythropoiesis

EPO is a 193-amino acid protein that stimulates the formation of red blood cells in the bone marrow. The kidney produces
85 percent of circulating EPO; the liver, the remainder. If you move to a higher altitude, the partial pressure of oxygen is
lower, meaning there is less pressure to push oxygen across the alveolar membrane and into the red blood cell.
