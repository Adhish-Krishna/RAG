In
individuals with more advanced osteoarthritis, the affected joints can become more painful and therefore are difficult
to use effectively, resulting in increased immobility. There is no cure for osteoarthritis, but several treatments can
help alleviate the pain. Treatments may include lifestyle changes, such as weight loss and low-impact exercise, and
over-the-counter or prescription medications that help to alleviate the pain and inflammation. For severe cases, joint
replacement surgery (arthroplasty) may be required.

 Joint replacement is a very invasive procedure, so other treatments are always tried before surgery. However
arthroplasty can provide relief from chronic pain and can enhance mobility within a few months following the surgery.
 This type of surgery involves replacing the articular surfaces of the bones with prosthesis (artificial components). For
example, in hip arthroplasty, the worn or damaged parts of the hip joint, including the head and neck of the femur and
the acetabulum of the pelvis, are removed and replaced with artificial joint components.
