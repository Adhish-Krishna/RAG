Buffer Systems in the Body

The buffer systems in the human body are extremely efficient, and different systems work at different rates. It takes only
seconds for the chemical buffers in the blood to make adjustments to pH. The respiratory tract can adjust the blood pH
upward in minutes by exhaling CO2 from the body. The renal system can also adjust blood pH through the excretion of
hydrogen ions (H*) and the conservation of bicarbonate, but this process takes hours to days to have an effect.

 The buffer systems functioning in blood plasma include plasma proteins, phosphate, and bicarbonate and carbonic
acid buffers. The kidneys help control acid-base balance by excreting hydrogen ions and generating bicarbonate that helps
maintain blood plasma pH within a normal range. Protein buffer systems work predominantly inside cells.

 Protein Buffers in Blood Plasma and Cells

Nearly all proteins can function as buffers. Proteins are made up of amino acids, which contain positively charged amino
groups and negatively charged carboxy!
