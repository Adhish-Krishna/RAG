Rod outer
segments are long columnar shapes with stacks of membrane-bound discs that contain the rhodopsin pigment. Cone
outer segments are short, tapered shapes with folds of membrane in place of the discs in the rods. (b) Tissue of
the retina shows a dense layer of nuclei of the rods and cones. LM x 800. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of

At the molecular level, visual stimuli cause changes in the photopigment molecule that lead to changes in membrane
potential of the photoreceptor cell. A single unit of light is called a photon, which is described in physics as a packet of
energy with properties of both a particle and a wave. The energy of a photon is represented by its wavelength, with each
wavelength of visible light corresponding to a particular color. Visible light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength
between 380 and 720 nm. Longer wavelengths of less than 380 nm fall into the infrared range, whereas shorter wavelengths
of more than 720 nm fall into the ultraviolet range.
