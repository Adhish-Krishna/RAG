The relationship of these glial cells to the structure of the CNS is seen
in Figure 12.11.

 Glial Cells of the PNS

One of the two types of glial cells found in the PNS is the satellite cell. Satellite cells are found in sensory and autonomic
ganglia, where they surround the cell bodies of neurons. This accounts for the name, based on their appearance under the
microscope. They provide support, performing similar functions in the periphery as astrocytes do in the CNSâ€”except, of
course, for establishing the BBB.

 The second type of glial cell is the Schwann cell, which insulate axons with myelin in the periphery. Schwann cells
are different than oligodendrocytes, in that a Schwann cell wraps around a portion of only one axon segment and no others.
 Oligodendrocytes have processes that reach out to multiple axon segments, whereas the entire Schwann cell surrounds just
one axon segment. The nucleus and cytoplasm of the Schwann cell are on the edge of the myelin sheath.
