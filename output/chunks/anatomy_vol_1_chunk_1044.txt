Thus, the switch to glycolysis results in a slower rate of ATP availability to
the muscle. The sugar used in glycolysis can be provided by blood glucose or by metabolizing glycogen that is stored in the
muscle. The breakdown of one glucose molecule produces two ATP and two molecules of pyruvic acid, which can be used

in aerobic respiration or when oxygen levels are low, converted to lactic

If oxygen is available, pyruvic acid is used in aerobic respiration.
