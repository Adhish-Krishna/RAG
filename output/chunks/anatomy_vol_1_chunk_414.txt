As you might expect, a fibrocyte, a less active form of fibroblast, is the second most common cell
type in connective tissue proper.

 Adipocytes are cells that store lipids as droplets that fill most of the cytoplasm. There are two basic types of
adipocytes: white and brown. The brown adipocytes store lipids as many droplets, and have high metabolic activity. In
contrast, white fat adipocytes store lipids as a single large drop and are metabolically less active. Their effectiveness at

storing large amounts of fat is witnessed in obese individuals. The number and type of adipocytes depends on the tissue and
location, and vary among individuals in the population.

 The mesenchymal cell is a multipotent adult stem cell. These cells can differentiate into any type of connective tissue
cells needed for repair and healing of damaged tissue.
