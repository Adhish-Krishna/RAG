172 CHAPTER 5 | THE INTEGUMENTARY SYSTEM

What do you think when you look at your skin in the mirror? Do you think about covering it with makeup, adding a tattoo,
or maybe a body piercing? Or do you think about the fact that the skin belongs to one of the body’s most essential and
dynamic systems: the integumentary system? The integumentary system refers to the skin and its accessory structures, and
it is responsible for much more than simply lending to your outward appearance. In the adult human body, the skin makes up
about 16 percent of body weight and covers an area of 1.5 to 2 m. In fact, the skin and accessory structures are the largest
organ system in the human body.
