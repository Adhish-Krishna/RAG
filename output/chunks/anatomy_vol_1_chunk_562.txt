As the name implies, an articulation is where two bone surfaces come together (articulus =
“Soint”). These surfaces tend to conform to one another, such as one being rounded and the other cupped, to facilitate the
function of the articulation. A projection is an area of a bone that projects above the surface of the bone. These are the
attachment points for tendons and ligaments. In general, their size and shape is an indication of the forces exerted through
the attachment to the bone. A hole is an opening or groove in the bone that allows blood vessels and nerves to enter the
bone. As with the other markings, their size and shape reflect the size of the vessels and nerves that penetrate the bone at
these points.
