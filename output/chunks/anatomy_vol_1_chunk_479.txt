The keratinocytes in the stratum spinosum begin the synthesis of keratin and release a water-repelling glycolipid that
helps prevent water loss from the body, making the skin relatively waterproof. As new keratinocytes are produced atop the
stratum basale, the keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum are pushed into the stratum granulosum.

 Stratum Granulosum

The stratum granulosum has a grainy appearance due to further changes to the keratinocytes as they are pushed from the
stratum spinosum. The cells (three to five layers deep) become flatter, their cell membranes thicken, and they generate large
amounts of the proteins keratin, which is fibrous, and keratohyalin, which accumulates as lamellar granules within the
cells (see Figure 5.5). These two proteins make up the bulk of the keratinocyte mass in the stratum granulosum and give
the layer its grainy appearance. The nuclei and other cell organelles disintegrate as the cells die, leaving behind the keratin,

keratohyalin, and cell membranes that will form the stratum lucidum, the stratum corneum, and the accessory structures of
hair and nails.
