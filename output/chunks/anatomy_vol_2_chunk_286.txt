As shown in this video,
the direct pathway is the shorter pathway through the system
that results in increased activity in the cerebral cortex and
increased motor activity. The direct pathway is described
as resulting in “disinhibition” of the thalamus. What does
disinhibition mean? What are the two neurons doing
individually to cause this?

4. Watch this video  (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/
basalnuclei2) to learn about the basal nuclei (also known
as the basal ganglia), which have two pathways that process
information within the cerebrum. As shown in this video, the
indirect pathway is the longer pathway through the system
that results in decreased activity in the cerebral cortex, and
therefore less motor activity. The indirect pathway has an
extra couple of connections in it, including disinhibition
of the subthalamic nucleus. What is the end result on the
thalamus, and therefore on movement initiated by the
cerebral cortex?
