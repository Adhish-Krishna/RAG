Not only do their menstrual periods
lessen and eventually cease, but their ovaries reduce in size and then cease the production of estrogen, a hormone that
promotes osteoblastic activity and production of bone matrix. Thus, osteoporosis is more common in women than in
men, but men can develop it, too. Anyone with a family history of osteoporosis has a greater risk of developing the
disease, so the best treatment is prevention, which should start with a childhood diet that includes adequate intake of
calcium and vitamin D and a lifestyle that includes weight-bearing exercise. These actions, as discussed above, are
important in building bone mass. Promoting proper nutrition and weight-bearing exercise early in life can maximize
bone mass before the age of 30, thus reducing the risk of osteoporosis.

 For many elderly people, a hip fracture can be life threatening. The fracture itself may not be serious, but
the immobility that comes during the healing process can lead to the formation of blood clots that can lodge in
the capillaries of the lungs, resulting in respiratory failure; pneumonia due to the lack of poor air exchange that
accompanies immobility; pressure sores (bed sores) that allow pathogens to enter the body and cause infections; and
urinary tract infections from catheterization.
