Finally, stem cells located where gastric
glands join the gastric pits quickly replace damaged epithelial mucosal cells, when the epithelial cells are shed. In fact, the
surface epithelium of the stomach is completely replaced every 3 to 6 days.

Ulcers: When the Mucosal Barrier Breaks Down

As effective as the mucosal barrier is, it is not a “fail-safe” mechanism. Sometimes, gastric juice eats away at the
superficial lining of the stomach mucosa, creating erosions, which mostly heal on their own. Deeper and larger erosions
are called ulcers.

 Why does the mucosal barrier break down? A number of factors can interfere with its ability to protect the
stomach lining. The majority of all ulcers are caused by either excessive intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, or Helicobacter pylori infection.
