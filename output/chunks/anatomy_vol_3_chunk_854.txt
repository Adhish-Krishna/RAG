Figure 28.22 Neonatal Circulatory System A newborn's circulatory system reconfigures immediately after birth. The
three fetal shunts have been closed permanently, facilitating blood flow to the liver and lungs.

 The newbornâ€™s first breath is vital to initiate the transition from the fetal to the neonatal circulatory pattern. Inflation
of the lungs decreases blood pressure throughout the pulmonary system, as well as in the right atrium and ventricle. In
response to this pressure change, the flow of blood temporarily reverses direction through the foramen ovale, moving from
the left to the right atrium, and blocking the shunt with two flaps of tissue. Within 1 year, the tissue flaps usually fuse over
the shunt, turning the foramen ovale into the fossa ovalis. The ductus arteriosus constricts as a result of increased oxygen
concentration, and becomes the ligamentum arteriosum.
