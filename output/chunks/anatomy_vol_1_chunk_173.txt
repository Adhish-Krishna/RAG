(a)
Without an enzyme, the energy input needed for a reaction to begin is high. (b) With the help of an enzyme, less
energy is needed for a reaction to begin.

 Enzymes are critical to the body’s healthy functioning. They assist, for example, with the breakdown of food and its
conversion to energy. In fact, most of the chemical reactions in the body are facilitated by enzymes.

 2.4 | Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human
Functioning

 By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Compare and contrast inorganic and organic compounds
¢ Identify the properties of water that make it essential to life
 ¢ Explain the role of salts in body functioning
¢ Distinguish between acids and bases, and explain their role in pH
¢ Discuss the role of buffers in helping the body maintain pH homeostasis

The concepts you have learned so far in this chapter govern all forms of matter, and would work as a foundation for geology
as well as biology.
