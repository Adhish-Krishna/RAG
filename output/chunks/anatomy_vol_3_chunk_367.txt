CCK stimulates the release
of pancreatic lipase from the pancreas and stimulates the contraction of the gallbladder to release stored bile salts into the
intestine. CCK also travels to the brain, where it can act as a hunger suppressant.

 Together, the pancreatic lipases and bile salts break down triglycerides into free fatty acids. These fatty acids can be
transported across the intestinal membrane. However, once they cross the membrane, they are recombined to again form
triglyceride molecules. Within the intestinal cells, these triglycerides are packaged along with cholesterol molecules in
phospholipid vesicles called chylomicrons (Figure 24.12). The chylomicrons enable fats and cholesterol to move within
the aqueous environment of your lymphatic and circulatory systems. Chylomicrons leave the enterocytes by exocytosis
and enter the lymphatic system via lacteals in the villi of the intestine. From the lymphatic system, the chylomicrons
are transported to the circulatory system. Once in the circulation, they can either go to the liver or be stored in fat cells
(adipocytes) that comprise adipose (fat) tissue found throughout the body.
