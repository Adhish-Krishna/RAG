the retina to the CNS. It is important to recognize when popular media and online sources oversimplify complex physiological
processes so that misunderstandings are not generated. This video was created by a medical device manufacturer who might be
trying to highlight other aspects of the visual system than retinal processing. The statement they make is not incorrect, it just
bundles together several steps, which makes it sound like RGCs are the transducers, rather than photoreceptors.
