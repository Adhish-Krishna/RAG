Please note that even if the equation looks
intimidating, breaking it down into its components and following the relationships will make these relationships clearer,
even if you are weak in math. Focus on the three critical variables: radius (r), vessel length (A), and viscosity (n).
Poiseuille’s equation:

Blood flow = ZAP"
8nd
* mis the Greek letter pi, used to represent the mathematical constant that is the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its
diameter. It may commonly be represented as 3.14, although the actual number extends to infinity.
 ¢ AP represents the difference in pressure.

 + 1‘ is the radius (one-half of the diameter) of the vessel to the fourth power.
 * tis the Greek letter eta and represents the viscosity of the blood.
 * is the Greek letter lambda and represents the length of a blood vessel.
 One of several things this equation allows us to do is calculate the resistance in the vascular system.
