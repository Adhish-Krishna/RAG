All of the tactile senses are processed in this area, including touch, pressure, tickle, pain,
itch, and vibration, as well as more general senses of the body such as proprioception and kinesthesia, which are the senses
of body position and movement, respectively.

 Anterior to the central sulcus is the frontal lobe, which is primarily associated with motor functions. The precentral
gyrus is the primary motor cortex. Cells from this region of the cerebral cortex are the upper motor neurons that instruct
cells in the spinal cord to move skeletal muscles. Anterior to this region are a few areas that are associated with planned
movements. The premotor area is responsible for thinking of a movement to be made. The frontal eye fields are important
in eliciting eye movements and in attending to visual stimuli. Brocaâ€™s area is responsible for the production of language,
or controlling movements responsible for speech; in the vast majority of people, it is located only on the left side.
