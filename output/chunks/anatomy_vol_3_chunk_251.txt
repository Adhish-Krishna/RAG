The region defined as hindgut begins with the last third of the transverse colon
and continues on. Food residue passing through the transverse colon travels across to the left side of the abdomen, where
the colon angles sharply immediately inferior to the spleen, at the left colic flexure (splenic flexure). From there, food
residue passes through the descending colon, which runs down the left side of the posterior abdominal wall. After entering
the pelvis inferiorly, it becomes the s-shaped sigmoid colon, which extends medially to the midline (Figure 23.21). The
ascending and descending colon, and the rectum (discussed next) are located in the retroperitoneum. The transverse and
sigmoid colon are tethered to the posterior abdominal wall by the mesocolon.
