However, in certain cases the cancerous cells remain undetected and continue to proliferate.
 If the resulting tumor does not pose a threat to surrounding tissues, it is said to be benign and can usually be easily removed.
 If capable of damage, the tumor is considered malignant and the patient is diagnosed with cancer.

Homeostatic MBALANCES

Cancer Arises from Homeostatic Imbalances

Cancer is an extremely complex condition, capable of arising from a wide variety of genetic and environmental
causes. Typically, mutations or aberrations in a cellâ€™s DNA that compromise normal cell cycle control systems lead to
cancerous tumors. Cell cycle control is an example of a homeostatic mechanism that maintains proper cell function and
health. While progressing through the phases of the cell cycle, a large variety of intracellular molecules provide stop
and go signals to regulate movement forward to the next phase.
