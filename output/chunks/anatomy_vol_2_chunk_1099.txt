The septa are the partitions that separate the chambers of the heart. They include the interatrial septum, the
interventricular septum, and the atrioventricular septum. Two of these openings are guarded by the atrioventricular valves,
the right tricuspid valve and the left mitral valve, which prevent the backflow of blood. Each is attached to chordae tendineae
that extend to the papillary muscles, which are extensions of the myocardium, to prevent the valves from being blown back
into the atria. The pulmonary valve is located at the base of the pulmonary trunk, and the left semilunar valve is located
at the base of the aorta. The right and left coronary arteries are the first to branch off the aorta and arise from two of the
three sinuses located near the base of the aorta and are generally located in the sulci. Cardiac veins parallel the small cardiac
arteries and generally drain into the coronary sinus.

19.2 Cardiac Muscle and Electrical Activity

The heart is regulated by both neural and endocrine control, yet it is capable of initiating its own action potential followed by
muscular contraction.
