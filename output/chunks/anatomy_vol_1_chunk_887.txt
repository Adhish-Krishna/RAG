Together, the interosseous membrane and these ligaments form the tibiofibular syndesmosis.

 The syndesmoses found in the forearm and leg serve to unite parallel bones and prevent their separation. However, a
syndesmosis does not prevent all movement between the bones, and thus this type of fibrous joint is functionally classified
as an amphiarthrosis. In the leg, the syndesmosis between the tibia and fibula strongly unites the bones, allows for little
movement, and firmly locks the talus bone in place between the tibia and fibula at the ankle joint. This provides strength
and stability to the leg and ankle, which are important during weight bearing. In the forearm, the interosseous membrane
is flexible enough to allow for rotation of the radius bone during forearm movements. Thus in contrast to the stability
provided by the tibiofibular syndesmosis, the flexibility of the antebrachial interosseous membrane allows for the much
greater mobility of the forearm.
