The regions of the body are labeled in boldface.

 A body that is lying down is described as either prone or supine. Prone describes a face-down orientation, and supine
describes a face up orientation. These terms are sometimes used in describing the position of the body during specific
physical examinations or surgical procedures.

 Regional Terms

The human body’s numerous regions have specific terms to help increase precision (see Figure 1.12). Notice that the term
“brachium” or “arm” is reserved for the “upper arm” and “antebrachium” or “forearm” is used rather than “lower arm.”
 Similarly, “femur” or “thigh” is correct, and “leg” or “crus” is reserved for the portion of the lower limb between the knee
and the ankle. You will be able to describe the body’s regions using the terms from the figure.

 Directional Terms

Certain directional anatomical terms appear throughout this and any other anatomy textbook (Figure 1.13).
