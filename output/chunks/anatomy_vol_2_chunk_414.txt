The cerebellum can make
the necessary changes through the rubrospinal tract. Modulating the basic command to walk also relies on spinal reflexes,
but the cerebellum is responsible for calculating the appropriate response. When the cerebellum does not work properly,
coordination and balance are severely affected. The most dramatic example of this is during the overconsumption of alcohol.
 Alcohol inhibits the ability of the cerebellum to interpret proprioceptive feedback, making it more difficult to coordinate
body movements, such as walking a straight line, or guide the movement of the hand to touch the tip of the nose.

Visit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/N YTmotor) to read about an elderly woman who starts to lose the ability
to control fine movements, such as speech and the movement of limbs. Many of the usual causes were ruled out. It was
not a stroke, Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, or thyroid dysfunction. The next most obvious cause was medication, so
her pharmacist had to be consulted.
