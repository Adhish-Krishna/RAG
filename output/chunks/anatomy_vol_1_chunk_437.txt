The synapse is the gap between nerve cells, or between a nerve cell and
across which the impulse is transmitted by chemical compounds known as

neurotransmitters. Neurons categorized as multipolar neurons have several dendrites and a single prominent axon. Bipolar
neurons possess a single dendrite and axon with the cell body, while unipolar neurons have only a single process extending

out from the cell body, which divides into a

‘unctional dendrite and into a functional axon. When a neuron is sufficiently

stimulated, it generates an action potential that propagates down the axon towards the synapse. If enough neurotransmitters
are released at the synapse to stimulate the next neuron or target, a response is generated.
 The second class of neural cells comprises the neuroglia or glial cells, which have been characterized as having a

simple support role. The word “glia” comes
complex role of neuroglia in the function o:

rom the Greek word for glue.
