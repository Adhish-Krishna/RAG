Respiratory Acidosis: Primary Carbonic Acid/CO2 Excess

Respiratory acidosis occurs when the blood is overly acidic due to an excess of carbonic acid, resulting from too much COz
in the blood. Respiratory acidosis can result from anything that interferes with respiration, such as pneumonia, emphysema,
or congestive heart failure.

 Respiratory Alkalosis: Primary Carbonic Acid/CO2 Deficiency

Respiratory alkalosis occurs when the blood is overly alkaline due to a deficiency in carbonic acid and CO2 levels in the
blood. This condition usually occurs when too much CO? is exhaled from the lungs, as occurs in hyperventilation, which
is breathing that is deeper or more frequent than normal. An elevated respiratory rate leading to hyperventilation can be
due to extreme emotional upset or fear, fever, infections, hypoxia, or abnormally high levels of catecholamines, such as
epinephrine and norepinephrine.
