This process allows for the recovery of large amounts of water from the filtrate back into the blood. In the absence of ADH,
these channels are not inserted, resulting in the excretion of water in the form of dilute urine. Most, if not all, cells of the
body contain aquaporin molecules, whose channels are so small that only water can pass. At least 10 types of aquaporins

are known in humans, and six of those are found in the kidney. The function of all aquaporins is to allow the movement of
water across the lipid-rich, hydrophobic cell membrane (Figure 25.15).

across the cell membrane, while allowing water to move due to osmosis.
