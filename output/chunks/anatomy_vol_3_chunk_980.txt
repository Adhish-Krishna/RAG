63 The shoulder joint allows for
a large range of motion. The primary support for the shoulder joint is provided by the four rotator cuff muscles. These muscles
serve as “dynamic ligaments” and thus can modulate their strengths of contraction as needed to hold the head of the humerus in
position at the glenoid fossa. Additional but weaker support comes from the coracohumeral ligament, an intrinsic ligament that
supports the superior aspect of the shoulder joint, and the glenohumeral ligaments, which are intrinsic ligaments that support the
anterior side of the joint. 64 A strong blow to the lateral side of the extended knee will cause the medial side of the knee joint
to open, resulting in a sequence of three injuries. First will be damage to the tibial collateral ligament. Since the medial meniscus
is attached to the tibial collateral ligament, the meniscus is also injured. The third structure injured would be the anterior cruciate
ligament. 65 Mesenchyme gives rise to cartilage models of the future limb bones.
