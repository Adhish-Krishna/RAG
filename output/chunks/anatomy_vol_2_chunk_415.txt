The side effect of a drug meant to help her sleep had resulted in changes in motor
control. What regions of the nervous system are likely to be the focus of haloperidol side effects?

Ventral Horn Output

The somatic nervous system provides output strictly to skeletal muscles. The lower motor neurons, which are responsible
for the contraction of these muscles, are found in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. These large, multipolar neurons have
a corona of dendrites surrounding the cell body and an axon that extends out of the ventral horn. This axon travels through
the ventral nerve root to join the emerging spinal nerve. The axon is relatively long because it needs to reach muscles in
the periphery of the body. The diameters of cell bodies may be on the order of hundreds of micrometers to support the long
axon; some axons are a meter in length, such as the lumbar motor neurons that innervate muscles in the first digits of the
feet.
