Bacterial Flora

Most bacteria that enter the alimentary canal are killed by lysozyme, defensins, HCl, or protein-digesting enzymes.
 However, trillions of bacteria live within the large intestine and are referred to as the bacterial flora. Most of the more
than 700 species of these bacteria are nonpathogenic commensal organisms that cause no harm as long as they stay in
the gut lumen. In fact, many facilitate chemical digestion and absorption, and some synthesize certain vitamins, mainly
biotin, pantothenic acid, and vitamin K. Some are linked to increased immune response. A refined system prevents these
bacteria from crossing the mucosal barrier. First, peptidoglycan, a component of bacterial cell walls, activates the release of
chemicals by the mucosaâ€™s epithelial cells, which draft immune cells, especially dendritic cells, into the mucosa. Dendritic
cells open the tight junctions between epithelial cells and extend probes into the lumen to evaluate the microbial antigens.
