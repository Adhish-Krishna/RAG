As shown in Figure 23.25, the hepatic artery delivers oxygenated blood from the heart to the liver. The
hepatic portal vein delivers partially deoxygenated blood containing nutrients absorbed from the small intestine and actually
supplies more oxygen to the liver than do the much smaller hepatic arteries. In addition to nutrients, drugs and toxins are
also absorbed. After processing the bloodborne nutrients and toxins, the liver releases nutrients needed by other cells back
into the blood, which drains into the central vein and then through the hepatic vein to the inferior vena cava. With this
hepatic portal circulation, all blood from the alimentary canal passes through the liver. This largely explains why the liver
is the most common site for the metastasis of cancers that originate in the alimentary canal.
