In addition, eliminating or at least alleviating the underlying
cause of the condition is required. This might include antibiotics and antihistamines, or select steroids, which may
aid in the repair of nerve damage. A common cause is sepsis (or septicemia), also called “blood poisoning,” which
is a widespread bacterial infection that results in an organismal-level inflammatory response known as septic shock.
 Neurogenic shock is a form of vascular shock that occurs with cranial or spinal injuries that damage the cardiovascular
centers in the medulla oblongata or the nervous fibers originating from this region. Anaphylactic shock is a severe
allergic response that causes the widespread release of histamines, triggering vasodilation throughout the body.

 * Obstructive shock, as the name would suggest, occurs when a significant portion of the vascular system is blocked.
 It is not always recognized as a distinct condition and may be grouped with cardiogenic shock, including pulmonary
embolism and cardiac tamponade.
