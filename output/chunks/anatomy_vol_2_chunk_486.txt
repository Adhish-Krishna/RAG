Short and Long Reflexes Sensory input can stimulate either a short or a long reflex. A sensory neuron
can project to the CNS or to an autonomic ganglion. The short reflex involves the direct stimulation of a postganglionic
fiber by the sensory neuron, whereas the long reflex involves integration in the spinal cord or brain.

 The difference between short and long reflexes is in the involvement of the CNS. Somatic reflexes always involve the
CNS, even in a monosynaptic reflex in which the sensory neuron directly activates the motor neuron. That synapse is in
the spinal cord or brain stem, so it has to involve the CNS. However, in the autonomic system there is the possibility that
the CNS is not involved. Because the efferent branch of a visceral reflex involves two neurons—the central neuron and
the ganglionic neuron—a “short circuit” can be possible. If a sensory neuron projects directly to the ganglionic neuron and
causes it to activate the effector target, then the CNS is not involved.
