CHAPTER 11 | THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM 419

Figure 11.4 Biceps Brachii Muscle Contraction The large mass at the center of a muscle is called the belly.
 Tendons emerge from both ends of the belly and connect the muscle to the bones, allowing the skeleton to move. The
tendons of the bicep connect to the upper arm and the forearm. (credit: Victoria Garcia)

Circular muscles are also called sphincters (see Figure 11.3). When they relax, the sphincters’ concentrically arranged
bundles of muscle fibers increase the size of the opening, and when they contract, the size of the opening shrinks to the point
of closure.
