Each of these has advantages and drawbacks. A genetic counselor can also help a couple
cope with the news that either one or both partners is a carrier of a genetic illness, or that their unborn child has been
diagnosed with a chromosomal disorder or other birth defect.

 To become a genetic counselor, one needs to complete a 4-year undergraduate program and then obtain a
Master of Science in Genetic Counseling from an accredited university. Board certification is attained after passing
examinations by the American Board of Genetic Counseling. Genetic counselors are essential professionals in many
branches of medicine, but there is a particular demand for preconception and prenatal genetic counselors.

1280 CHAPTER 28 | DEVELOPMENT AND INHERITANCE

KEY TERMS

acrosomal reaction release of digestive enzymes by sperm that enables them to burrow through the corona radiata
and penetrate the zona pellucida of an oocyte prior to fertilization

acrosome cap-like vesicle located at the anterior-most region of a sperm that is rich with lysosomal enzymes capable of
digesting the protective layers surrounding the oocyte

afterbirth third stage of childbirth in which the placenta and associated fetal membranes are expelled

allantois finger-like outpocketing of yolk sac forms the primitive excretory duct of the embryo; precursor to the urinary
bladder

allele alternative forms of a gene that occupy a specific locus on a specific gene

amnion transparent membranous sac that encloses the developing fetus and fills with amniotic fluid

amniotic cavity cavity that opens up between the inner cell mass and the trophoblast; develops into amnion
autosomal chromosome in humans, the 22 pairs of chromosomes that are not the sex chromosomes (XX or XY)

autosomal dominant pattern of dominant inheritance that corresponds to a gene on one of the 22 autosomal
chromosomes

autosomal recessive pattern of recessive inheritance that corresponds to a gene on one of the 22 autosomal
chromosomes

Braxton Hicks contractions weak and irregular peristaltic contractions that can occur in the second and third
trimesters; they do not indicate that childbirth is imminent

blastocoel fluid-filled cavity of the blastocyst

blastocyst term for the conceptus at the developmental stage that consists of about 100 cells shaped into an inner cel
mass that is fated to become the embryo and an outer trophoblast that is fated to become the associated fetal
membranes and placenta

blastomere daughter cell of a cleavage

brown adipose tissue highly vascularized fat tissue that is packed with mitochondria; these properties confer the
ability to oxidize fatty acids to generate heat

capacitation process that occurs in the female reproductive tract in which sperm are prepared for fertilization; leads to
increased motility and changes in their outer membrane that improve their ability to release enzymes capable of
digesting an oocyteâ€™s outer layers

carrier heterozygous individual who does not display symptoms of a recessive genetic disorder but can transmit the
disorder to his or her offspring

chorion membrane that develops from the syncytiotrophoblast, cytotrophoblast, and mesoderm; surrounds the embryo
and forms the fetal portion of the placenta through the chorionic villi

chorionic membrane precursor to the chorion; forms from extra-embryonic mesoderm cells
chorionic villi projections of the chorionic membrane that burrow into the endometrium and develop into the placenta

cleavage form of mitotic cell division in which the cell divides but the total volume remains unchanged; this process
serves to produce smaller and smaller cells

codominance pattern of inheritance that corresponds to the equal, distinct, and simultaneous expression of two
different alleles
