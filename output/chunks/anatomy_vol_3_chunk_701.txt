The cortex is composed of a tissue framework called the ovarian stroma that forms the bulk of the adult ovary.
 Oocytes develop within the outer layer of this stroma, each surrounded by supporting cells. This grouping of an oocyte and
its supporting cells is called a follicle. The growth and development of ovarian follicles will be described shortly. Beneath
the cortex lies the inner ovarian medulla, the site of blood vessels, lymph vessels, and the nerves of the ovary. You will learn
more about the overall anatomy of the female reproductive system at the end of this section.

CHAPTER 27 | THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 1217

The Ovarian Cycle

The ovarian cycle is a set of predictable changes in a female’s oocytes and ovarian follicles. During a woman’s reproductive
years, it is a roughly 28-day cycle that can be correlated with, but is not the same as, the menstrual cycle (discussed
shortly).
