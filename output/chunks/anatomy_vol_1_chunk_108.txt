A standard reference position for mapping the body’s
structures is the normal anatomical position. Regions of the body are identified using terms such as “occipital” that are more
precise than common words and phrases such as “the back of the head.” Directional terms such as anterior and posterior
are essential for accurately describing the relative locations of body structures. Images of the body’s interior commonly
align along one of three planes: the sagittal, frontal, or transverse. The body’s organs are organized in one of two main
cavities—dorsal (also referred to posterior) and ventral (also referred to anterior)—which are further sub-divided according
to the structures present in each area. The serous membranes have two layers—parietal and visceral—surrounding a fluid
filled space. Serous membranes cover the lungs (pleural serosa), heart (pericardial serosa), and some abdominopelvic organs
(peritoneal serosa).

1.7 Medical Imaging

Detailed anatomical drawings of the human body first became available in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries; however,
it was not until the end of the nineteenth century, and the discovery of X-rays, that anatomists and physicians discovered
non-surgical methods to look inside a living body.
