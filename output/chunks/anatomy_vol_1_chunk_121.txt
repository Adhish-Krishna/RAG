An object’s mass
is the amount of matter contained in the object, and the object’s mass is the same whether that object is on Earth or in the
zero-gravity environment of outer space. An object’s weight, on the other hand, is its mass as affected by the pull of gravity.
 Where gravity strongly pulls on an object’s mass its weight is greater than it is where gravity is less strong. An object of a
certain mass weighs less on the moon, for example, than it does on Earth because the gravity of the moon is less than that
of Earth. In other words, weight is variable, and is influenced by gravity. A piece of cheese that weighs a pound on Earth
weighs only a few ounces on the moon.
