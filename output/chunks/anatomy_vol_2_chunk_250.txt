Some peripheral structures
are incorporated into the other organs of the body. In describing the anatomy of the PNS, it is necessary to describe the
common structures, the nerves and the ganglia, as they are found in various parts of the body. Many of the neural structures
that are incorporated into other organs are features of the digestive system; these structures are known as the enteric
nervous system and are a special subset of the PNS.

 Ganglia

A ganglion is a group of neuron cell bodies in the periphery. Ganglia can be categorized, for the most part, as either sensory
ganglia or autonomic ganglia, referring to their primary functions. The most common type of sensory ganglion is a dorsal
(posterior) root ganglion. These ganglia are the cell bodies of neurons with axons that are sensory endings in the periphery,
such as in the skin, and that extend into the CNS through the dorsal nerve root.
