At the start of atrial systole,
the ventricles are normally filled with approximately 70-80 percent of their capacity due to inflow during diastole. Atrial
contraction, also referred to as the “atrial kick,” contributes the remaining 20-30 percent of filling (see Figure 19.27). Atrial
systole lasts approximately 100 ms and ends prior to ventricular systole, as the atrial muscle returns to diastole.

 Ventricular Systole

Ventricular systole (see Figure 19.27) follows the depolarization of the ventricles and is represented by the QRS complex
in the ECG. It may be conveniently divided into two phases, lasting a total of 270 ms. At the end of atrial systole and just
prior to atrial contraction, the ventricles contain approximately 130 mL blood in a resting adult in a standing position. This
volume is known as the end diastolic volume (EDV) or preload.

 Initially, as the muscles in the ventricle contract, the pressure of the blood within the chamber rises, but it is not yet
high enough to open the semilunar (pulmonary and aortic) valves and be ejected from the heart.
