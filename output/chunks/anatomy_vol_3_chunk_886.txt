Autosomal Recessive Inheritance

When a genetic disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, the disorder corresponds to the recessive phenotype.
 Heterozygous individuals will not display symptoms of this disorder, because their unaffected gene will compensate. Such
an individual is called a carrier. Carriers for an autosomal recessive disorder may never know their genotype unless they
have a child with the disorder.

 An example of an autosomal recessive disorder is cystic fibrosis (CF), which we introduced earlier. CF is characterized
by the chronic accumulation of a thick, tenacious mucus in the lungs and digestive tract. Decades ago, children with CF
rarely lived to adulthood. With advances in medical technology, the average lifespan in developed countries has increased
into middle adulthood. CF is a relatively common disorder that occurs in approximately 1 in 2000 Caucasians. A child born
to two CF carriers would have a 25 percent chance of inheriting the disease. This is the same 3:1 dominant:recessive ratio
that Mendel observed in his pea plants would apply here.
