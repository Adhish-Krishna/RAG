Colorectal Cancer

Each year, approximately 140,000 Americans are diagnosed with colorectal cancer, and another 49,000 die from it,
making it one of the most deadly malignancies. People with a family history of colorectal cancer are at increased
risk. Smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and a diet high in animal fat and protein also increase the risk. Despite
popular opinion to the contrary, studies support the conclusion that dietary fiber and calcium do not reduce the risk of
colorectal cancer.

 Colorectal cancer may be signaled by constipation or diarrhea, cramping, abdominal pain, and rectal bleeding.
 Bleeding from the rectum may be either obvious or occult (hidden in feces). Since most colon cancers arise from
benign mucosal growths called polyps, cancer prevention is focused on identifying these polyps. The colonoscopy is
both diagnostic and therapeutic. Colonoscopy not only allows identification of precancerous polyps, the procedure also
enables them to be removed before they become malignant.
