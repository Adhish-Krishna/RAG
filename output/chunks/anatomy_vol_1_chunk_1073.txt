Instead, structural proteins are added to muscle fibers in a process called hypertrophy,
so cell diameter increases. The reverse, when structural proteins are lost and muscle mass decreases, is called atrophy.
 Age-related muscle atrophy is called sarcopenia. Cellular components of muscles can also undergo changes in response to
changes in muscle use.

 Endurance Exercise

Slow fibers are predominantly used in endurance exercises that require little force but involve numerous repetitions. The
aerobic metabolism used by slow-twitch fibers allows them to maintain contractions over long periods. Endurance training
modifies these slow fibers to make them even more efficient by producing more mitochondria to enable more aerobic
metabolism and more ATP production. Endurance exercise can also increase the amount of myoglobin in a cell, as increased
aerobic respiration increases the need for oxygen. Myoglobin is found in the sarcoplasm and acts as an oxygen storage
supply for the mitochondria.
 The training can trigger the formation of more extensive capillary networks around the fiber, a process called
angiogenesis, to supply oxygen and remove metabolic waste.
