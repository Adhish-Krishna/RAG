the condition of being able to
differentiate into one of a few possible cell types

organelle any of several different types of membrane-enclosed specialized structures in the cell that perform specific
functions for the cell

osmosis diffusion of molecules down their concentration across a selectively permeable membrane
passive transport form of transport across the cell membrane that does not require input of cellular energy

peripheral protein membrane-associated protein that does not span the width of the lipid bilayer, but is attached
peripherally to integral proteins, membrane lipids, or other components of the membrane

peroxisome membrane-bound organelle that contains enzymes primarily responsible for detoxifying harmful
substances

phagocytosis endocytosis of large particles

pinocytosis endocytosis of fluid

pluripotent describes the condition of being able to differentiate into a large variety of cell types
polypeptide chain of amino acids linked by peptide bonds

polyribosome simultaneous translation of a single mRNA transcript by multiple ribosomes
promoter region of DNA that signals transcription to begin at that site within the gene

prophase first stage of mitosis (and meiosis), characterized by breakdown of the nuclear envelope and condensing of
the chromatin to form chromosomes

proteome full complement of proteins produced by a cell (determined by the cell’s specific gene expression)

RNA polymerase enzyme that unwinds DNA and then adds new nucleotides to a growing strand of RNA for the
transcription phase of protein synthesis

reactive oxygen species (ROS) a group of extremely reactive peroxides and oxygen-containing radicals that may
contribute to cellular damage

receptor-mediated endocytosis endocytosis of ligands attached to membrane-bound receptors
receptor protein molecule that contains a binding site for another specific molecule (called a ligand)
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) RNA that makes up the subunits of a ribosome

ribosome cellular organelle that functions in protein synthesis

S phase stage of the cell cycle during which DNA replication occurs

selective permeability feature of any barrier that allows certain substances to cross but excludes others

sister chromatid one of a pair of identical chromosomes, formed during DNA replication

sodium-potassium pump (also, Na*/K* ATP-ase) membrane-embedded protein pump that uses ATP to move Na®

out of a cell and K* into the cell
somatic cell all cells of the body excluding gamete cells
spliceosome complex of enzymes that serves to splice out the introns of a pre-mRNA transcript
splicing the process of modifying a pre-mRNA transcript by removing certain, typically non-coding, regions

stem cell cell that is oligo-, multi-, or pleuripotent that has the ability to produce additional stem cells rather than
becoming further specialized

telophase final stage of mitosis (and meiosis), preceding cytokinesis, characterized by the formation of two new
daughter nuclei

totipotent embryonic cells that have the ability to differentiate into any type of cell and organ in the body
transcription factor one of the proteins that regulate the transcription of genes
transcription process of producing an mRNA molecule that is complementary to a particular gene of DNA

transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules of RNA that serve to bring amino acids to a growing polypeptide strand and properly
place them into the sequence

translation process of producing a protein from the nucleotide sequence code of an mRNA transcript

triplet consecutive sequence of three nucleotides on a DNA molecule that, when transcribed into an mRNA codon,
corresponds to a particular amino acid

unipotent describes the condition of being committed to a single specialized cell type

CHAPTER REVIEW

3.1 The Cell Membrane

The cell membrane provides a barrier around the cell, separating its internal components from the extracellular environment.
