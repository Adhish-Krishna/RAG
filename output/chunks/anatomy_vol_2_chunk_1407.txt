These memory cells lead to the differentiation of more plasma cells and
memory B cells during secondary responses.

 Primary versus Secondary B Cell Responses

Primary and secondary responses as they relate to T cells were discussed earlier. This section will look at these responses
with B cells and antibody production. Because antibodies are easily obtained from blood samples, they are easy to follow
and graph (Figure 21.24). As you will see from the figure, the primary response to an antigen (representing a pathogen)
is delayed by several days. This is the time it takes for the B cell clones to expand and differentiate into plasma cells. The
level of antibody produced is low, but it is sufficient for immune protection. The second time a person encounters the same
antigen, there is no time delay, and the amount of antibody made is much higher. Thus, the secondary antibody response
overwhelms the pathogens quickly and, in most situations, no symptoms are felt.
