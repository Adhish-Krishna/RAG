The excess water causes swelling of the
cells; the swelling of red blood cells—decreasing their oxygen-carrying efficiency and making them potentially too large to
fit through capillaries—along with the swelling of neurons in the brain can result in brain damage or even death.

 Hypernatremia is an abnormal increase of blood sodium. It can result from water loss from the blood, resulting in
the hemoconcentration of all blood constituents. Hormonal imbalances involving ADH and aldosterone may also result in
higher-than-normal sodium values.

 Potassium

Potassium is the major intracellular cation. It helps establish the resting membrane potential in neurons and muscle fibers
after membrane depolarization and action potentials. In contrast to sodium, potassium has very little effect on osmotic
pressure. The low levels of potassium in blood and CSF are due to the sodium-potassium pumps in cell membranes,
which maintain the normal potassium concentration gradients between the ICF and ECF.
