For instance,
a cluster of proteins collectively referred to as the protein C system inactivates clotting factors involved in the intrinsic
pathway. TFPI (tissue factor pathway inhibitor) inhibits the conversion of the inactive factor VII to the active form in the
extrinsic pathway. Antithrombin inactivates factor X and opposes the conversion of prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin
in the common pathway. And as noted earlier, basophils release heparin, a short-acting anticoagulant that also opposes
prothrombin. Heparin is also found on the surfaces of cells lining the blood vessels. A pharmaceutical form of heparin is
often administered therapeutically, for example, in surgical patients at risk for blood clots.

View these animations (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/coagulation) to explore the intrinsic, extrinsic, and common
pathways that are involved the process of coagulation. The coagulation cascade restores hemostasis by activating
coagulation factors in the presence of an injury. How does the endothelium of the blood vessel walls prevent the blood
from coagulating as it flows through the blood vessels?

Disorders of Clotting

Either an insufficient or an excessive production of platelets can lead to severe disease or death.
