This process is so important for nerve cells that it accounts for the majority of their ATP
usage.

ATP

Figure 3.9 Sodium-Potassium Pump The sodium-potassium pump is found in many cell (plasma) membranes.
 Powered by ATP, the pump moves sodium and potassium ions in opposite directions, each against its concentration
gradient. In a single cycle of the pump, three sodium ions are extruded from and two potassium ions are imported into
the cell.

 Other forms of active transport do not involve membrane carriers. Endocytosis (bringing “into the cell”) is the
process of a cell ingesting material by enveloping it in a portion of its cell membrane, and then pinching off that
portion of membrane (Figure 3.10).
