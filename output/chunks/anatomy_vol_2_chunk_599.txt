Testing vision relies on the tests that are common in an optometry office. The Snellen chart (Figure 16.7)
demonstrates visual acuity by presenting standard Roman letters in a variety of sizes. The result of this test is a rough
generalization of the acuity of a person based on the normal accepted acuity, such that a letter that subtends a visual angle
of 5 minutes of an arc at 20 feet can be seen. To have 20/60 vision, for example, means that the smallest letters that a person
can see at a 20-foot distance could be seen by a person with normal acuity from 60 feet away. Testing the extent of the visual
field means that the examiner can establish the boundaries of peripheral vision as simply as holding their hands out to either
side and asking the patient when the fingers are no longer visible without moving the eyes to track them.
