This will ultimately decrease blood osmolarity toward the physiologic norm.
 If the osmolarity of the filtrate is too low, the juxtaglomerular cells will relax, increasing the GFR and enhancing the loss of
water to the urine, causing blood osmolarity to rise. In other words, when osmolarity goes up, filtration and urine formation
decrease and water is retained. When osmolarity goes down, filtration and urine formation increase and water is lost by way
of the urine. The net result of these opposing actions is to keep the rate of filtration relatively constant. A second function
of the macula densa cells is to regulate renin release from the juxtaglomerular cells of the afferent arteriole (Figure 25.14).
 Active renin is a protein comprised of 304 amino acids that cleaves several amino acids from angiotensinogen to produce
angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is not biologically active until converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) from the lungs.
