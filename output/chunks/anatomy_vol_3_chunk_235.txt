The
duodenum can therefore be subdivided into four segments: the superior, descending, horizontal, and ascending duodenum.

 Of particular interest is the hepatopancreatic ampulla (ampulla of Vater). Located in the duodenal wall, the ampulla
marks the transition from the anterior portion of the alimentary canal to the mid-region, and is where the bile duct (through
which bile passes from the liver) and the main pancreatic duct (through which pancreatic juice passes from the pancreas)
join. This ampulla opens into the duodenum at a tiny volcano-shaped structure called the major duodenal papilla. The
hepatopancreatic sphincter (sphincter of Oddi) regulates the flow of both bile and pancreatic juice from the ampulla into
the duodenum.
