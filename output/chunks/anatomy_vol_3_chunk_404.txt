The carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins in the foods you eat are used for energy to power molecular, cellular, and organ
system activities. Importantly, the energy is stored primarily as fats. The quantity and quality of food that is ingested,
digested, and absorbed affects the amount of fat that is stored as excess calories. Diet—both what you eat and how much
you eat—has a dramatic impact on your health. Eating too much or too little food can lead to serious medical issues,
including cardiovascular disease, cancer, anorexia, and diabetes, among others.
