Infectious diseases
can lead to loss of function throughout the CNS as components of nervous tissue, specifically astrocytes and microglia,
react to the disease. Blunt force trauma, such as from a motor vehicle accident, can physically damage the CNS.

 A class of disorders that affect the nervous system are the neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer’s disease,
Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Creutzfeld—Jacob disease, multiple sclerosis
(MS), and other disorders that are the result of nervous tissue degeneration. In diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, or
ALS, neurons die; in diseases like MS, myelin is affected. Some of these disorders affect motor function, and others present
with dementia. How patients with these disorders perform in the neurological exam varies, but is often broad in its effects,
such as memory deficits that compromise many aspects of the mental status exam, or movement deficits that compromise
aspects of the cranial nerve exam, the motor exam, or the coordination exam.
