In DCS, gases dissolved in the blood (primarily nitrogen) come rapidly out of solution, forming bubbles in the
blood and in other body tissues. This occurs because when pressure of a gas over a liquid is decreased, the amount
of gas that can remain dissolved in the liquid also is decreased. It is air pressure that keeps your normal blood gases
dissolved in the blood. When pressure is reduced, less gas remains dissolved. You have seen this in effect when you
open a carbonated drink. Removing the seal of the bottle reduces the pressure of the gas over the liquid. This in turn
causes bubbles as dissolved gases (in this case, carbon dioxide) come out of solution in the liquid.

 The most common symptoms of DCS are pain in the joints, with headache and disturbances of vision occurring
in 10 percent to 15 percent of cases. Left untreated, very severe DCS can result in death. Immediate treatment is with
pure oxygen. The affected person is then moved into a hyperbaric chamber.
