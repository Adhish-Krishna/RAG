A typical long bone shows the gross anatomical characteristics of bone.

 The wider section at each end of the bone is called the epiphysis (plural = epiphyses), which is filled with spongy bone.
 Red marrow fills the spaces in the spongy bone. Each epiphysis meets the diaphysis at the metaphysis, the narrow area that
contains the epiphyseal plate (growth plate), a layer of hyaline (transparent) cartilage in a growing bone. When the bone
stops growing in early adulthood (approximately 18-21 years), the cartilage is replaced by osseous tissue and the epiphyseal
plate becomes an epiphyseal line.

 The medullary cavity has a delicate membranous lining called the endosteum (end- = “inside”; oste- = “bone”), where
bone growth, repair, and remodeling occur. The outer surface of the bone is covered with a fibrous membrane called the
periosteum (peri- = “around” or “surrounding”).
