When something upsets
that balance, the homeostatic mechanisms strive to return it to its regular state. For each organ system, there may be more
of a sympathetic or parasympathetic tendency to the resting state, which is known as the autonomic tone of the system.
 For example, the heart rate was described above. Because the resting heart rate is the result of the parasympathetic system
slowing the heart down from its intrinsic rate of 100 bpm, the heart can be said to be in parasympathetic tone.

 In a similar fashion, another aspect of the cardiovascular system is primarily under sympathetic control. Blood
pressure is partially determined by the contraction of smooth muscle in the walls of blood vessels. These tissues have
adrenergic receptors that respond to the release of norepinephrine from postganglionic sympathetic fibers by constricting
and increasing blood pressure. The hormones released from the adrenal medulla—epinephrine and norepinephrine—will
also bind to these receptors. Those hormones travel through the bloodstream where they can easily interact with the
receptors in the vessel walls.
