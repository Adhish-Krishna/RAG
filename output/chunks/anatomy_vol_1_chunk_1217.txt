The fibularis tertius, a small muscle that originates on the
anterior surface of the fibula, is associated with the extensor digitorum longus and sometimes fused to it, but is not present

in all people. Thick bands of connective tissue called the superior extensor retinaculum (transverse ligament of the ankle)
and the inferior extensor retinaculum, hold the tendons of these muscles in place during dorsiflexion.

 The lateral compartment of the leg includes two muscles: the fibularis longus (peroneus longus) and the fibularis
brevis (peroneus brevis). The superficial muscles in the posterior compartment of the leg all insert onto the calcaneal
tendon (Achilles tendon), a strong tendon that inserts into the calcaneal bone of the ankle. The muscles in this compartment
are large and strong and keep humans upright. The most superficial and visible muscle of the calf is the gastrocnemius.
 Deep to the gastrocnemius is the wide, flat soleus. The plantaris runs obliquely between the two; some people may have
two of these muscles, whereas no plantaris is observed in about seven percent of other cadaver dissections.
