Salts

Recall that salts are formed when ions form ionic bonds. In these reactions, one atom gives up one or more electrons, and
thus becomes positively charged, whereas the other accepts one or more electrons and becomes negatively charged. You
can now define a salt as a substance that, when dissolved in water, dissociates into ions other than Hâ€™ or OH. This fact is
important in distinguishing salts from acids and bases, discussed next.

 A typical salt, NaCl, dissociates completely in water (Figure 2.15). The positive and negative regions on the water
molecule (the hydrogen and oxygen ends respectively) attract the negative chloride and positive sodium ions, pulling them
away from each other. Again, whereas nonpolar and polar covalently bonded compounds break apart into molecules in
solution, salts dissociate into ions. These ions are electrolytes; they are capable of conducting an electrical current in
solution. This property is critical to the function of ions in transmitting nerve impulses and prompting muscle contraction.
