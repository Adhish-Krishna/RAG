Relaxation of the ileocecal sphincter
is controlled by both nerves and hormones. First, digestive activity in the stomach provokes the gastroileal reflex, which
increases the force of ileal segmentation. Second, the stomach releases the hormone gastrin, which enhances ileal motility,
thus relaxing the ileocecal sphincter. After chyme passes through, backward pressure helps close the sphincter, preventing
backflow into the ileum. Because of this reflex, your lunch is completely emptied from your stomach and small intestine by
the time you eat your dinner. It takes about 3 to 5 hours for all chyme to leave the small intestine.

 Chemical Digestion in the Small Intestine

The digestion of proteins and carbohydrates, which partially occurs in the stomach, is completed in the small intestine with
the aid of intestinal and pancreatic juices. Lipids arrive in the intestine largely undigested, so much of the focus here is on
lipid digestion, which is facilitated by bile and the enzyme pancreatic lipase.
