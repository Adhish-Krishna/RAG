Two additional single vessels
arise from the abdominal aorta. These are the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. The superior mesenteric artery
arises approximately 2.5 cm after the celiac trunk and branches into several major vessels that supply blood to the small
intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), the pancreas, and a majority of the large intestine. The inferior mesenteric
artery supplies blood to the distal segment of the large intestine, including the rectum. It arises approximately 5 cm superior
to the common iliac arteries.

 In addition to these single branches, the abdominal aorta gives rise to several significant paired arteries along the
way. These include the inferior phrenic arteries, the adrenal arteries, the renal arteries, the gonadal arteries, and the lumbar
arteries. Each inferior phrenic artery is a counterpart of a superior phrenic artery and supplies blood to the inferior
surface of the diaphragm. The adrenal artery supplies blood to the adrenal (suprarenal) glands and arises near the superior
mesenteric artery.
