An important characteristic of solutions is that they
are homogeneous; that is, the solute molecules are distributed evenly throughout the solution. If you were to stir a teaspoon
of sugar into a glass of water, the sugar would dissolve into sugar molecules separated by water molecules. The ratio of
sugar to water in the left side of the glass would be the same as the ratio of sugar to water in the right side of the glass.
 If you were to add more sugar, the ratio of sugar to water would change, but the distribution—provided you had stirred
well—would still be even.

 Water is considered the “universal solvent” and it is believed that life cannot exist without water because of this.
 Water is certainly the most abundant solvent in the body; essentially all of the body’s chemical reactions occur among
compounds dissolved in water. Because water molecules are polar, with regions of positive and negative electrical charge,
water readily dissolves ionic compounds and polar covalent compounds.
