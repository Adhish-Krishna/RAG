The nucleus ambiguus, which is named for its ambiguous histology, also contributes to the
parasympathetic output of the vagus nerve and targets muscles in the pharynx and larynx for swallowing and speech, as
well as contributing to the parasympathetic tone of the heart along with the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus.

CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 633

Everyday CONNECTION

Exercise and the Autonomic System

In addition to its association with the fight-or-flight response and rest-and-digest functions, the autonomic system
is responsible for certain everyday functions. For example, it comes into play when homeostatic mechanisms
dynamically change, such as the physiological changes that accompany exercise. Getting on the treadmill and putting
in a good workout will cause the heart rate to increase, breathing to be stronger and deeper, sweat glands to activate,
and the digestive system to suspend activity.
