Figure 20.32 Major Arteries of the Upper Limb The flow chart summarizes the distribution of the major arteries
from the heart into the upper limb.

 Arteries Serving the Upper Limbs

Vessel Description
Continuation of the subclavian artery as it penetrates the body wall and enters the axillary
. region; supplies blood to the region near the head of the humerus (humeral circumflex
Axillary artery

arteries); the majority of the vessel continues into the brachium and becomes the brachial
artery

Brachial artery

Continuation of the axillary artery in the brachium; supplies blood to much of the brachial
region; gives off several smaller branches that provide blood to the posterior surface of the
arm in the region of the elbow; bifurcates into the radial and ulnar arteries at the coronoid
fossa

Formed at the bifurcation of the brachial artery; parallels the radius; gives off smaller

Radial artery branches until it reaches the carpal region where it fuses with the ulnar artery to form the
superficial and deep palmar arches; supplies blood to the lower arm and carpal region
Formed at the bifurcation of the brachial artery; parallels the ulna; gives off smaller branches

Ulnar artery until it reaches the carpal region where it fuses with the radial artery to form the superficial

and deep palmar arches; supplies blood to the lower arm and carpal region

Palmar arches
(superficial and
deep)
