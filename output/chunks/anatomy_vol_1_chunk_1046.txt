and less fatigue. Aerobic training also increases the efficiency of the circulatory system so that O2 can be supplied to the
muscles for longer periods of time.

 Muscle fatigue occurs when a muscle can no longer contract in response to signals from the nervous system. The
exact causes of muscle fatigue are not fully known, although certain factors have been correlated with the decreased muscle
contraction that occurs during fatigue. ATP is needed for normal muscle contraction, and as ATP reserves are reduced,
muscle function may decline. This may be more of a factor in brief, intense muscle output rather than sustained, lower
intensity efforts.
