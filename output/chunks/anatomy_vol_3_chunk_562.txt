H™* and HCO3" are
secreted or reabsorbed as needed to maintain acid-base balance. Movement of water from the glomerulus is primarily due
to pressure, whereas that of peritubular capillaries and vasa recta is due to osmolarity and concentration gradients. The
PCT is the most metabolically active part of the nephron and uses a wide array of protein micromachines to maintain
homeostasis—symporters, antiporters, and ATPase active transporters—in conjunction with diffusion, both simple and

facilitated. Almost 100 percent of glucose, amino acids, and vitamins are recovered in the PCT. Bicarbonate (HCO3 )
is recovered using the same enzyme, carbonic anhydrase (CA), found in erythrocytes. The recovery of solutes creates
an osmotic gradient to promote the recovery of water. The descending loop of the juxtaglomerular nephrons reaches an
osmolarity of up to 1200 mOsmol/kg, promoting the recovery of water. The ascending loop is impervious to water but

actively recovers Na’, reducing filtrate osmolarity to 50-100 mOsmol/kg.
