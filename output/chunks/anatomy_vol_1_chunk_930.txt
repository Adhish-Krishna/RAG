Protraction and Retraction

Protraction and retraction are anterior-posterior movements of the scapula or mandible. Protraction of the scapula occurs
when the shoulder is moved forward, as when pushing against something or throwing a ball. Retraction is the opposite
motion, with the scapula being pulled posteriorly and medially, toward the vertebral column. For the mandible, protraction
occurs when the lower jaw is pushed forward, to stick out the chin, while retraction pulls the lower jaw backward. (See
Figure 9.13j.)

Depression and Elevation

Depression and elevation are downward and upward movements of the scapula or mandible. The upward movement of the
scapula and shoulder is elevation, while a downward movement is depression. These movements are used to shrug your
shoulders. Similarly, elevation of the mandible is the upward movement of the lower jaw used to close the mouth or bite on
something, and depression is the downward movement that produces opening of the mouth (see Figure 9.13k).
