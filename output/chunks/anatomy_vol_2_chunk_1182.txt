CHP is the force that drives
fluid out of capillaries and into the tissues.

 As fluid exits a capillary and moves into tissues, the hydrostatic pressure in the interstitial fluid correspondingly
rises. This opposing hydrostatic pressure is called the interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure (IFHP). Generally, the CHP
originating from the arterial pathways is considerably higher than the IFHP, because lymphatic vessels are continually

absorbing excess fluid from the tissues. Thus, fluid generally moves out of the capillary and into the interstitial fluid. This
process is called filtration.

 Osmotic Pressure

The net pressure that drives reabsorption—the movement of fluid from the interstitial fluid back into the capillaries—is
called osmotic pressure (sometimes referred to as oncotic pressure). Whereas hydrostatic pressure forces fluid out of the
capillary, osmotic pressure draws fluid back in. Osmotic pressure is determined by osmotic concentration gradients, that is,
the difference in the solute-to-water concentrations in the blood and tissue fluid.
