Figure 15.2 Connections of Sympathetic Division of the Autonomic Nervous System Neurons from the lateral
horn of the spinal cord (preganglionic neurons) project to the chain ganglia on either side of the vertebral column or
to collateral (prevertebral) ganglia that are anterior to the vertebral column in the abdominal cavity. Axons from these
ganglionic neurons (postganglionic fibers) then project to target effectors throughout the body.

 To continue with the analogy of the circuit diagram, there are three different types of “junctions” that operate within
the sympathetic system (Figure 15.3). The first type is most direct: the sympathetic nerve projects to the chain ganglion
at the same level as the target effector (the organ, tissue, or gland to be innervated). An example of this type is spinal
nerve T1 that synapses with the T1 chain ganglion to innervate the trachea. The fibers of this branch are called white
rami communicantes (singular = ramus communicans); they are myelinated and therefore referred to as white (see Figure
15.3a).
