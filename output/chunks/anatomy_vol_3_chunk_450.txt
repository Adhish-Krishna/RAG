The presence of leukocytes may indicate a urinary tract infection. Leukocyte
esterase is released by leukocytes; if detected in the urine, it can be taken as indirect evidence of a urinary tract infection

 Protein does not normally leave the glomerular capillaries, so only trace amounts of protein should be found in the
urine, approximately 10 mg/100 mL in a random sample. If excessive protein is detected in the urine, it usually means that
the glomerulus is damaged and is allowing protein to “leak” into the filtrate.

 Ketones are byproducts of fat metabolism. Finding ketones in the urine suggests that the body is using fat as an energy
source in preference to glucose. In diabetes mellitus when there is not enough insulin (type I diabetes mellitus) or because
of insulin resistance (type II diabetes mellitus), there is plenty of glucose, but without the action of insulin, the cells cannot
take it up, so it remains in the bloodstream.
