Germ cell development progresses from the basement
membrane—at the perimeter of the tubule—toward the lumen. Let’s look more closely at these cell types.

 Sertoli Cells

Surrounding all stages of the developing sperm cells are elongate, branching Sertoli cells. Sertoli cells are a type of
supporting cell called a sustentacular cell, or sustenocyte, that are typically found in epithelial tissue. Sertoli cells secrete
signaling molecules that promote sperm production and can control whether germ cells live or die. They extend physically
around the germ cells from the peripheral basement membrane of the seminiferous tubules to the lumen. Tight junctions
between these sustentacular cells create the blood-testis barrier, which keeps bloodborne substances from reaching the
germ cells and, at the same time, keeps surface antigens on developing germ cells from escaping into the bloodstream and
prompting an autoimmune response.
