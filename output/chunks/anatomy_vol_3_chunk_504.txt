Many of these

substances (amino acids and glucose) use symport mechanisms for transport along with Na”. Antiport, active transport,
diffusion, and facilitated diffusion are additional mechanisms by which substances are moved from one side of a membrane
to the other. Recall that cells have two surfaces: apical and basal. The apical surface is the one facing the lumen or open
space of a cavity or tube, in this case, the inside of the PCT. The basal surface of the cell faces the connective tissue base to
which the cell attaches (basement membrane) or the cell membrane closer to the basement membrane if there is a stratified
layer of cells. In the PCT, there is a single layer of simple cuboidal endothelial cells against the basement membrane. The
numbers and particular types of pumps and channels vary between the apical and basilar surfaces (Table 25.7). A few of

the substances that are transported with Na* (symport mechanism) on the apical membrane include CI, Ca*’, amino acids,
glucose, and PO} ~ .
