The parasympathetic system has no significant input to the systemic blood vessels, so the
sympathetic system determines their tone.

 There are a limited number of blood vessels that respond to sympathetic input in a different fashion. Blood vessels in
skeletal muscle, particularly those in the lower limbs, are more likely to dilate. It does not have an overall effect on blood
pressure to alter the tone of the vessels, but rather allows for blood flow to increase for those skeletal muscles that will be
active in the fight-or-flight response. The blood vessels that have a parasympathetic projection are limited to those in the
erectile tissue of the reproductive organs. Acetylcholine released by these postganglionic parasympathetic fibers cause the
vessels to dilate, leading to the engorgement of the erectile tissue.
