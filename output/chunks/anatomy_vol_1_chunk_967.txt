Since they are located on the sides of the ankle joint, they allow for
dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of the foot. They also prevent abnormal side-to-side and twisting movements of the talus
and calcaneus bones during eversion and inversion of the foot. On the medial side is the broad deltoid ligament. The deltoid
ligament supports the ankle joint and also resists excessive eversion of the foot. The lateral side of the ankle has several

smaller ligaments. These include the anterior talofibular ligament and

the posterior talofibular ligament, both of which

span between the talus bone and the lateral malleolus of the fibula, and the calcaneofibular ligament, located between the
calcaneus bone and fibula. These ligaments support the ankle and also resist excess inversion of the foot.

flexion of the foot.
