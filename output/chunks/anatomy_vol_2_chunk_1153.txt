Pulse can be palpated manually by placing the tips of the fingers across an artery that runs close to the body surface
and pressing lightly. While this procedure is normally performed using the radial artery in the wrist or the common carotid
artery in the neck, any superficial artery that can be palpated may be used (Figure 20.11). Common sites to find a pulse
include temporal and facial arteries in the head, brachial arteries in the upper arm, femoral arteries in the thigh, popliteal
arteries behind the knees, posterior tibial arteries near the medial tarsal regions, and dorsalis pedis arteries in the feet. A
variety of commercial electronic devices are also available to measure pulse.
