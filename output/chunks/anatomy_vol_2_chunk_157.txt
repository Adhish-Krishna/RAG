Outside the plasma membrane of the axon
is the myelin sheath, which is composed of the tightly
wrapped plasma membrane of a Schwann cell. What aspects
of the cells in this image react with the stain that makes them
the deep, dark, black color, such as the multiple layers that
are the myelin sheath?

5. What happens across the membrane of an electrically
active cell is a dynamic process that is hard to visualize
with static images or through text descriptions. View this
animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/dynamicl) to
really understand the process. What is the difference
between the driving force for Na* and K*? And what is
similar about the movement of these two ions?

see a virtual neurophysiology lab, and to observe
electrophysiological processes in the nervous system, where
scientists directly measure the electrical signals produced by
neurons.
