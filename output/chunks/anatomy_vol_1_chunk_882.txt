The gap between the bones may be narrow or wide. There are three
types of fibrous joints. A suture is the narrow fibrous joint found between most bones of the skull. At a syndesmosis joint,
the bones are more widely separated but are held together by a narrow band of fibrous connective tissue called a ligament
or a wide sheet of connective tissue called an interosseous membrane. This type of fibrous joint is found between the shaft
regions of the long bones in the forearm and in the leg. Lastly, a gomphosis is the narrow fibrous joint between the roots of
a tooth and the bony socket in the jaw into which the tooth fits.
