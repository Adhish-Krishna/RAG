Figure 6.19 Progression from Epiphyseal Plate to Epiphyseal Line As a bone matures, the epiphyseal plate
progresses to an epiphyseal line. (a) Epiphyseal plates are visible in a growing bone. (b) Epiphyseal lines are the
remnants of epiphyseal plates in a mature bone.

 How Bones Grow in Diameter

While bones are increasing in length, they are also increasing in diameter; growth in diameter can continue even after
longitudinal growth ceases. This is called appositional growth. Osteoclasts resorb old bone that lines the medullary cavity,
while osteoblasts, via intramembranous ossification, produce new bone tissue beneath the periosteum. The erosion of old
bone along the medullary cavity and the deposition of new bone beneath the periosteum not only increase the diameter of
the diaphysis but also increase the diameter of the medullary cavity.
