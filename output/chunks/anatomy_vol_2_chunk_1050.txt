Nevertheless, both ventricles pump the same amount of blood. This quantity is referred to as
stroke volume. Stroke volume will normally be in the range of 70-80 mL. Since ventricular systole began with an EDV
of approximately 130 mL of blood, this means that there is still 50-60 mL of blood remaining in the ventricle following
contraction. This volume of blood is known as the end systolic volume (ESV).

 Ventricular Diastole

Ventricular relaxation, or diastole, follows repolarization of the ventricles and is represented by the T wave of the ECG. It
too is divided into two distinct phases and lasts approximately 430 ms.

 During the early phase of ventricular diastole, as the ventricular muscle relaxes, pressure on the remaining blood within
the ventricle begins to fall. When pressure within the ventricles drops below pressure in both the pulmonary trunk and aorta,
blood flows back toward the heart, producing the dicrotic notch (small dip) seen in blood pressure tracings.
