 Sweat Glands

When the body becomes warm, sudoriferous glands produce sweat to cool the body. Sweat glands develop from epidermal
projections into the dermis and are classified as merocrine glands; that is, the secretions are excreted by exocytosis through a
duct without affecting the cells of the gland. There are two types of sweat glands, each secreting slightly different products.

all over the skinâ€™s surface, but are especially abundant on the palms of the hand, the soles of the feet, and the forehead
