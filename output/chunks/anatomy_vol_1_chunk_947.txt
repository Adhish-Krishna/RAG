elbow is supported by the radial collateral ligament. This arises from the lateral epicondyle

humerus and then blends into the lateral side of the annular ligament. The annular ligament encircles the head of

ius. This ligament su

pports the head of the radius as it articulates with the radial notch of the ulna at the proximal

nar joint. This is a pivot joint that allows for rotation of the radius during supination and pronation of the forearm.
