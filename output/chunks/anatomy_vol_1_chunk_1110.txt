Smooth muscle can be stimulated by pacesetter cells, by the autonomic
nervous system, by hormones, spontaneously, or by stretching. The fibers in some smooth muscle have latch-bridges, cross-
bridges that cycle slowly without the need for ATP; these muscles can maintain low-level contractions for long periods.
 Single-unit smooth muscle tissue contains gap junctions to synchronize membrane depolarization and contractions so that
the muscle contracts as a single unit. Single-unit smooth muscle in the walls of the viscera, called visceral muscle, has a
stress-relaxation response that permits muscle to stretch, contract, and relax as the organ expands. Multiunit smooth muscle
cells do not possess gap junctions, and contraction does not spread from one cell to the next.

 10.9 Development and Regeneration of Muscle Tissue

Muscle tissue arises from embryonic mesoderm. Somites give rise to myoblasts and fuse to form a myotube. The nucleus
of each contributing myoblast remains intact in the mature skeletal muscle cell, resulting in a mature, multinucleate cell.
