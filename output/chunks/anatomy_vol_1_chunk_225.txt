Also, certain
proteins act as hormones, chemical messengers that help regulate body functions, For example, growth hormone is
important for skeletal growth, among other roles.

 As was noted earlier, the basic and acidic components enable proteins to function as buffers in maintaining acid-base
balance, but they also help regulate fluid—electrolyte balance. Proteins attract fluid, and a healthy concentration of proteins
in the blood, the cells, and the spaces between cells helps ensure a balance of fluids in these various “compartments.”
 Moreover, proteins in the cell membrane help to transport electrolytes in and out of the cell, keeping these ions in a healthy
balance. Like lipids, proteins can bind with carbohydrates. They can thereby produce glycoproteins or proteoglycans, both
of which have many functions in the body.

 The body can use proteins for energy when carbohydrate and fat intake is inadequate, and stores of glycogen and
adipose tissue become depleted.
