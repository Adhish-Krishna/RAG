Obviously, calcium homeostasis is critical. The skeletal, endocrine, and digestive systems play a role in this, but the
kidneys do, too. These body systems work together to maintain a normal calcium level in the blood (Figure 6.24).

Figure 6.24 Pathways in Calcium Homeostasis The body regulates calcium homeostasis with two pathways; one
is signaled to turn on when blood calcium levels drop below normal and one is the pathway that is signaled to turn on
when blood calcium levels are elevated.

 Calcium is a chemical element that cannot be produced by any biological processes. The only way it can enter the
body is through the diet. The bones act as a storage site for calcium: The body deposits calcium in the bones when blood
levels get too high, and it releases calcium when blood levels drop too low.
