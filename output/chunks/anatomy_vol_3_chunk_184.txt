These GI hormones are
secreted by specialized epithelial cells, called endocrinocytes, located in the mucosal epithelium of the stomach and small
intestine. These hormones then enter the bloodstream, through which they can reach their target organs.

23.3 | The Mouth, Pharynx, and Esophagus

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the structures of the mouth, including its three accessory digestive organs
* Group the 32 adult teeth according to name, location, and function
* Describe the process of swallowing, including the roles of the tongue, upper esophageal sphincter, and epiglottis
¢ Trace the pathway food follows from ingestion into the mouth through release into the stomach

In this section, you will examine the anatomy and functions of the three main organs of the upper alimentary canal—the
mouth, pharynx, and esophagus—as well as three associated accessory organs—the tongue, salivary glands, and teeth.
