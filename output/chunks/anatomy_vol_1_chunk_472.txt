The skin is composed of two main layers: the epidermis, made of closely packed epithelial
cells, and the dermis, made of dense, irregular connective tissue that houses blood vessels, hair follicles, sweat glands,
and other structures. Beneath the dermis lies the hypodermis, which is composed mainly of loose connective and fatty
tissues.

The Epidermis

The epidermis is composed of keratinized, stratified squamous epithelium. It is made of four or five layers of epithelial
cells, depending on its location in the body. It does not have any blood vessels within it (i.e., it is avascular).
