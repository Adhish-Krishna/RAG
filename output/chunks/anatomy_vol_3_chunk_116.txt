A lower partial pressure of oxygen means that there is a smaller difference
in partial pressures between the alveoli and the blood, so less oxygen crosses the respiratory membrane. As a result, fewer
oxygen molecules are bound by hemoglobin. Despite this, the tissues of the body still receive a sufficient amount of oxygen
during rest at high altitudes. This is due to two major mechanisms. First, the number of oxygen molecules that enter the
tissue from the blood is nearly equal between sea level and high altitudes. At sea level, hemoglobin saturation is higher,
but only a quarter of the oxygen molecules are actually released into the tissue. At high altitudes, a greater proportion of
molecules of oxygen are released into the tissues. Secondly, at high altitudes, a greater amount of BPG is produced by
erythrocytes, which enhances the dissociation of oxygen from hemoglobin. Physical exertion, such as skiing or hiking, can
lead to altitude sickness due to the low amount of oxygen reserves in the blood at high altitudes.
