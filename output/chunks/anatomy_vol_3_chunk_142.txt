Increased levels of circulating erythrocytes provide an
increased amount of hemoglobin that helps supply an individual with more oxygen, preventing the symptoms of AMS.

 22.7 Embryonic Development of the Respiratory System

The development of the respiratory system in the fetus begins at about 4 weeks and continues into childhood. Ectodermal
tissue in the anterior portion of the head region invaginates posteriorly, forming olfactory pits, which ultimately fuse with
endodermal tissue of the early pharynx. At about this same time, an protrusion of endodermal tissue extends anteriorly from
the foregut, producing a lung bud, which continues to elongate until it forms the laryngotracheal bud. The proximal portion
of this structure will mature into the trachea, whereas the bulbous end will branch to form two bronchial buds. These buds
then branch repeatedly, so that at about week 16, all major airway structures are present. Development progresses after
week 16 as respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts form, and extensive vascularization occurs.
