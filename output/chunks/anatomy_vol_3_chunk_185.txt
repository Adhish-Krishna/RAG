The Mouth

The cheeks, tongue, and palate frame the mouth, which is also called the oral cavity (or buccal cavity). The structures of
the mouth are illustrated in Figure 23.7.

 At the entrance to the mouth are the lips, or labia (singular = labium). Their outer covering is skin, which transitions

to a mucous membrane in the mouth proper. Lips are very vascular with a thin layer of keratin; hence, the reason they are
"red." They have a huge representation on the cerebral cortex, which probably explains the human fascination with kissing!
 The lips cover the orbicularis oris muscle, which regulates what comes in and goes out of the mouth. The labial frenulum
is a midline fold of mucous membrane that attaches the inner surface of each lip to the gum. The cheeks make up the oral
cavityâ€™s sidewalls. While their outer covering is skin, their inner covering is mucous membrane. This membrane is made
up of non-keratinized, stratified squamous epithelium.
