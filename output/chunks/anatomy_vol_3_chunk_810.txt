Organogenesis

Following gastrulation, rudiments of the central nervous system develop from the ectoderm in the process of neurulation
(Figure 28.13). Specialized neuroectodermal tissues along the length of the embryo thicken into the neural plate. During
the fourth week, tissues on either side of the plate fold upward into a neural fold. The two folds converge to form the neural
tube. The tube lies atop a rod-shaped, mesoderm-derived notochord, which eventually becomes the nucleus pulposus of
intervertebral discs. Block-like structures called somites form on either side of the tube, eventually differentiating into the
axial skeleton, skeletal muscle, and dermis. During the fourth and fifth weeks, the anterior neural tube dilates and subdivides
to form vesicles that will become the brain structures.

 Folate, one of the B vitamins, is important to the healthy development of the neural tube. A deficiency of maternal
folate in the first weeks of pregnancy can result in neural tube defects, including spina bifida—a birth defect in which spinal
tissue protrudes through the newborn’s vertebral column, which has failed to completely close.
