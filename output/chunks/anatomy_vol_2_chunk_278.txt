The cerebrum is formed directly from the
telencephalon. The diencephalon is the only region that keeps its embryonic name. The mesencephalon, metencephalon,
and myelencephalon become the brain stem. The cerebellum also develops from the metencephalon and is a separate region
of the adult brain.

 The spinal cord develops out of the rest of the neural tube and retains the tube structure, with the nervous tissue
thickening and the hollow center becoming a very small central canal through the cord. The rest of the hollow center of the
neural tube corresponds to open spaces within the brain called the ventricles, where cerebrospinal fluid is found.

13.2 The Central Nervous System

The adult brain is separated into four major regions: the cerebrum, the diencephalon, the brain stem, and the cerebellum.
 The cerebrum is the largest portion and contains the cerebral cortex and subcortical nuclei. It is divided into two halves by
the longitudinal fissure.

 The cortex is separated into the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes.
