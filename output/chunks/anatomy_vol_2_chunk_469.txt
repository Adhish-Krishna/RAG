The term adrenergic should remind you of the word adrenaline, which is associated with the fight-or-flight response
described at the beginning of the chapter. Adrenaline and epinephrine are two names for the same molecule. The adrenal
gland (in Latin, ad- = “on top of”; renal = “kidney”) secretes adrenaline. The ending “-ine” refers to the chemical being
derived, or extracted, from the adrenal gland. A similar construction from Greek instead of Latin results in the word
epinephrine (epi- = “above”; nephr- = “kidney”). In scientific usage, epinephrine is preferred in the United States, whereas
adrenaline is preferred in Great Britain, because “adrenalin” was once a registered, proprietary drug name in the United
States. Though the drug is no longer sold, the convention of referring to this molecule by the two different names persists.
