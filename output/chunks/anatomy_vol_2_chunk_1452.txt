These vaccines are still in the development stages,
but some positive and encouraging results have been obtained clinically.

 It is tempting to focus on the complexity of the immune system and the problems it causes as a negative. The upside
to immunity, however, is so much greater: The benefit of staying alive far outweighs the negatives caused when the system
does sometimes go awry. Working on “autopilot,” the immune system helps to maintain your health and kill pathogens. The

of HIV disease, the immune system is gone completely.
