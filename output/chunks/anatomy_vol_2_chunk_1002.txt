Immediate treatments for MI are essential and include administering supplemental oxygen, aspirin that helps to
break up clots, and nitroglycerine administered sublingually (under the tongue) to facilitate its absorption. Despite
its unquestioned success in treatments and use since the 1880s, the mechanism of nitroglycerine is still incompletely
understood but is believed to involve the release of nitric oxide, a known vasodilator, and endothelium-derived
releasing factor, which also relaxes the smooth muscle in the tunica media of coronary vessels. Longer-term treatments
include injections of thrombolytic agents such as streptokinase that dissolve the clot, the anticoagulant heparin, balloon
angioplasty and stents to open blocked vessels, and bypass surgery to allow blood to pass around the site of blockage. If
the damage is extensive, coronary replacement with a donor heart or coronary assist device, a sophisticated mechanical
device that supplements the pumping activity of the heart, may be employed.
