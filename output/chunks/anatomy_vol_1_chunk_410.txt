The amount and structure of each component correlates with the function of the tissue, from the rigid ground
substance in bones supporting the body to the inclusion of specialized cells; for example, a phagocytic cell that engulfs
pathogens and also rids tissue of cellular debris.

 Functions of Connective Tissues

Connective tissues perform many functions in the body, but most importantly, they support and connect other tissues; from
the connective tissue sheath that surrounds muscle cells, to the tendons that attach muscles to bones, and to the skeleton that
supports the positions of the body. Protection is another major function of connective tissue, in the form of fibrous capsules
and bones that protect delicate organs and, of course, the skeletal system. Specialized cells in connective tissue defend the
body from microorganisms that enter the body. Transport of fluid, nutrients, waste, and chemical messengers is ensured
by specialized fluid connective tissues, such as blood and lymph.
