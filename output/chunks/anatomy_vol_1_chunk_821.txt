The patella articulates with the patellar surface of the femur and thus prevents rubbing of the muscle
tendon against the distal femur. The patella also lifts the tendon away from the knee joint, which increases the leverage
power of the quadriceps femoris muscle as it acts across the knee. The patella does not articulate with the tibia.

Runner’s Knee

Runner’s knee, also known as patellofemoral syndrome, is the most common overuse injury among runners. It is most
frequent in adolescents and young adults, and is more common in females. It often results from excessive running,
particularly downhill, but may also occur in athletes who do a lot of knee bending, such as jumpers, skiers, cyclists,
weight lifters, and soccer players.
