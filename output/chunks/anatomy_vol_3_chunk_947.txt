46 A single primary ossification center is present,
during endochondral ossification, deep in the periosteal collar. Like the primary ossification center, secondary ossification centers
are present during endochondral ossification, but they form later, and there are two of them, one in each epiphysis. 47 In closed
reduction, the broken ends of a fractured bone can be reset without surgery. Open reduction requires surgery to return the broken
ends of the bone to their correct anatomical position. A partial fracture would likely require closed reduction. A compound fracture
would require open reduction. 48 The internal callus is produced by cells in the endosteum and is composed of a fibrocartilaginous
matrix. The external callus is produced by cells in the periosteum and consists of hyaline cartilage and bone. 49 Since maximum
bone mass is achieved by age 30, I would want this patient to have adequate calcium and vitamin D in her diet.
