When blood pressure rises too high, the baroreceptors fire at a higher rate and trigger parasympathetic stimulation
of the heart. As a result, cardiac output falls. Sympathetic stimulation of the peripheral arterioles will also decrease,
resulting in vasodilation. Combined, these activities cause blood pressure to fall.

 * When blood pressure drops too low, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases. This will trigger an increase in
sympathetic stimulation of the heart, causing cardiac output to increase. It will also trigger sympathetic stimulation of
the peripheral vessels, resulting in vasoconstriction. Combined, these activities cause blood pressure to rise.

Figure 20.18 Baroreceptor Reflexes for Maintaining Vascular Homeostasis Increased blood pressure results in
increased rates of baroreceptor firing, whereas decreased blood pressure results in slower rates of fire, both initiating
the homeostatic mechanism to restore blood pressure.
