types of tissue in the body are epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial tissue is made of layers of cells that cover
the surfaces of the body that come into contact with the exterior world, line internal cavities, and form glands. Connective tissue
binds the cells and organs of the body together and performs many functions, especially in the protection, support, and integration
of the body. Muscle tissue, which responds to stimulation and contracts to provide movement, is divided into three major types:
skeletal (voluntary) muscles, smooth muscles, and the cardiac muscle in the heart. Nervous tissue allows the body to receive
signals and transmit information as electric impulses from one region of the body to another. 33 The zygote divides into many
cells. As these cells become specialized, they lose their ability to differentiate into all tissues. At first they form the three primary
germ layers. Following the cells of the ectodermal germ layer, they too become more restricted in what they can form.
