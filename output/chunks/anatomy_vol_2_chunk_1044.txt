Some devices also contain built-in defibrillators.

 Cardiac Muscle Metabolism

Normally, cardiac muscle metabolism is entirely aerobic. Oxygen from the lungs is brought to the heart, and every
other organ, attached to the hemoglobin molecules within the erythrocytes. Heart cells also store appreciable amounts of
oxygen in myoglobin. Normally, these two mechanisms, circulating oxygen and oxygen attached to myoglobin, can supply
sufficient oxygen to the heart, even during peak performance.

 812 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART

Fatty acids and glucose from the circulation are broken down within the mitochondria to release energy in the form of
ATP. Both fatty acid droplets and glycogen are stored within the sarcoplasm and provide additional nutrient supply. (Seek
additional content for more detail about metabolism.)
