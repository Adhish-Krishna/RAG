The four DNA bases are adenine (A), thymine (T),
cytosine (C), and guanine (G). Because of their shape and charge, the two bases that compose a pair always bond together.
 Adenine always binds with thymine, and cytosine always binds with guanine. The particular sequence of bases along the
DNA molecule determines the genetic code. Therefore, if the two complementary strands of DNA were pulled apart, you
could infer the order of the bases in one strand from the bases in the other, complementary strand. For example, if one strand
has a region with the sequence AGTGCCT, then the sequence of the complementary strand would be TCACGGA.
