It primarily affects males, and it is usually
diagnosed in early childhood. DMD usually first appears as difficulty with balance and motion, and then progresses to
an inability to walk. It continues progressing upward in the body from the lower extremities to the upper body, where it
affects the muscles responsible for breathing and circulation. It ultimately causes death due to respiratory failure, and
those afflicted do not usually live past their 20s.

 Because DMD is caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for dystrophin, it was thought that introducing
healthy myoblasts into patients might be an effective treatment. Myoblasts are the embryonic cells responsible for
muscle development, and ideally, they would carry healthy genes that could produce the dystrophin needed for
normal muscle contraction. This approach has been largely unsuccessful in humans. A recent approach has involved
attempting to boost the muscle’s production of utrophin, a protein similar to dystrophin that may be able to assume the
role of dystrophin and prevent cellular damage from occurring.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Explain concentric, isotonic, and eccentric contractions
¢ Describe the length-tension relationship
¢ Describe the three phases of a muscle twitch
¢ Define wave summation, tetanus, and treppe

To move an object, referred to as load, the sarcomeres in the muscle fibers of the skeletal muscle must shorten.
