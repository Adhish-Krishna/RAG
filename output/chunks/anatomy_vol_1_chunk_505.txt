Most sebaceous glands are associated with hair follicles. They generate and excrete sebum, a mixture of lipids, onto
the skin surface, thereby naturally lubricating the dry and dead layer of keratinized cells of the stratum corneum, keeping
it pliable. The fatty acids of sebum also have antibacterial properties, and prevent water loss from the skin in low-humidity
environments. The secretion of sebum is stimulated by hormones, many of which do not become active until puberty. Thus,
sebaceous glands are relatively inactive during childhood.

5.3 | Functions of the Integumentary System

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 * Describe the different functions of the skin and the structures that enable them
Â¢ Explain how the skin helps maintain body temperature

The skin and accessory structures perform a variety of essential functions, such as protecting the body from invasion by
microorganisms, chemicals, and other environmental factors; preventing dehydration; acting as a sensory organ; modulating
body temperature and electrolyte balance; and synthesizing vitamin D.
