This first fiber in
the pathway synapses on a thalamic cell that then projects to the visual cortex in the occipital lobe where “seeing,” or
visual perception, takes place. This video gives an abbreviated overview of the visual system by concentrating on the
pathway from the eyes to the occipital lobe. The video makes the statement (at 0:45) that “specialized cells in the retina
called ganglion cells convert the light rays into electrical signals.” What aspect of retinal processing is simplified by
that statement? Explain your answer.

 Sensory Nerves

Once any sensory cell transduces a stimulus into a nerve impulse, that impulse has to travel along axons to reach the CNS.
 In many of the special senses, the axons leaving the sensory receptors have a topographical arrangement, meaning that
the location of the sensory receptor relates to the location of the axon in the nerve.
