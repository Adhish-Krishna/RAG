After birth, the fontanelles allow for continued growth and
expansion of the skull as the brain enlarges. The largest fontanelle is located on the anterior head, at the junction of the
frontal and parietal bones. The fontanelles decrease in size and disappear by age 2. However, the skull bones remained
separated from each other at the sutures, which contain dense fibrous connective tissue that unites the adjacent bones. The
connective tissue of the sutures allows for continued growth of the skull bones as the brain enlarges during childhood
growth.

 The second mechanism for bone development in the skull produces the facial bones and floor of the brain case. This
also begins with the localized accumulation of mesenchymal cells. However, these cells differentiate into cartilage cells,
which produce a hyaline cartilage model of the future bone. As this cartilage model grows, it is gradually converted into
bone through the process of endochondral ossification. This is a slow process and the cartilage is not completely converted
to bone until the skull achieves its full adult size.
