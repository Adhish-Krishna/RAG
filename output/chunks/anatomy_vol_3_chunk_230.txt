Gastric emptying is regulated by both the stomach and the duodenum. The presence of chyme in the duodenum
activates receptors that inhibit gastric secretion. This prevents additional chyme from being released by the stomach before
the duodenum is ready to process it.

 Chemical Digestion

The fundus plays an important role, because it stores both undigested food and gases that are released during the process
of chemical digestion. Food may sit in the fundus of the stomach for a while before being mixed with the chyme. While
the food is in the fundus, the digestive activities of salivary amylase continue until the food begins mixing with the acidic
chyme. Ultimately, mixing waves incorporate this food with the chyme, the acidity of which inactivates salivary amylase
and activates lingual lipase. Lingual lipase then begins breaking down triglycerides into free fatty acids, and mono- and
diglycerides.

 The breakdown of protein begins in the stomach through the actions of HCl and the enzyme pepsin.
