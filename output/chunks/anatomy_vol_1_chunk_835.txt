The foot has a transverse arch, a medial longitudinal arch, and a lateral longitudinal arch (see Figure 8.19). The
transverse arch forms the medial-lateral curvature of the mid-foot. It is formed by the wedge shapes of the cuneiform bones

and bases (proximal ends) of the first to fourth metatarsal bones. This arch helps to distribute body weight from side to side
within the foot, thus allowing the foot to accommodate uneven terrain.

 The longitudinal arches run down the length of the foot. The lateral longitudinal arch is relatively flat, whereas
the medial longitudinal arch is larger (taller). The longitudinal arches are formed by the tarsal bones posteriorly and the
metatarsal bones anteriorly. These arches are supported at either end, where they contact the ground. Posteriorly, this support
is provided by the calcaneus bone and anteriorly by the heads (distal ends) of the metatarsal bones.
