Anabolic Steroids

The endocrine system can be exploited for illegal or unethical purposes. A prominent example of this is the use of
steroid drugs by professional athletes.

 Commonly used for performance enhancement, anabolic steroids are synthetic versions of the male sex hormone,
testosterone. By boosting natural levels of this hormone, athletes experience increased muscle mass. Synthetic versions
of human growth hormone are also used to build muscle mass.

 The use of performance-enhancing drugs is banned by all major collegiate and professional sports organizations
in the United States because they impart an unfair advantage to athletes who take them.
