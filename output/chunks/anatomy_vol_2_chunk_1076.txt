Baroreceptors Increased rates of firing, indicating higher blood volume/pressure

Limbic system

Anticipation of relaxation

Catecholamines

Decreased epinephrine and norepinephrine

Thyroid hormones

Decreased T3 and T4

Calcium Decreased Ca**
Potassium Increased K*
 Sodium Increased Na*

Body temperature Decrease in body temperature

Epinephrine and Norepinephrine

The catecholamines, epinephrine and NE, secreted by the adrenal medulla form one component of the extended fight-or-
flight mechanism. The other component is sympathetic stimulation. Epinephrine and NE have similar effects: binding to
the beta-1 receptors, and opening sodium and calcium ion chemical- or ligand-gated channels. The rate of depolarization
is increased by this additional influx of positively charged ions, so the threshold is reached more quickly and the period
of repolarization is shortened.
