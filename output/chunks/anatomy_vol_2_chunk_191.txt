In mammals, the cerebrum comprises the outer
gray matter that is the cortex (from the Latin word meaning “bark of a tree”) and several deep nuclei that belong to three
important functional groups. The basal nuclei are responsible for cognitive processing, the most important function being
that associated with planning movements. The basal forebrain contains nuclei that are important in learning and memory.
 The limbic cortex is the region of the cerebral cortex that is part of the limbic system, a collection of structures involved
in emotion, memory, and behavior.

 Cerebral Cortex

The cerebrum is covered by a continuous layer of gray matter that wraps around either side of the forebrain—the cerebral
cortex. This thin, extensive region of wrinkled gray matter is responsible for the higher functions of the nervous system. A
gyrus (plural = gyri) is the ridge of one of those wrinkles, and a sulcus (plural = sulci) is the groove between two gyri.
