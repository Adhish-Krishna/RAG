Other synapses are similar to this, and the specifics are different,
but they all contain the same characteristics.

 Neurotransmitter Release

When an action potential reaches the axon terminals, voltage-gated Ca** channels in the membrane of the synaptic end
bulb open. The concentration of Ca?* increases inside the end bulb, and the Ca?* ion associates with proteins in the outer
surface of neurotransmitter vesicles. The Ca" facilitates the merging of the vesicle with the presynaptic membrane so that
the neurotransmitter is released through exocytosis into the small gap between the cells, known as the synaptic cleft.

 Once in the synaptic cleft, the neurotransmitter diffuses the short distance to the postsynaptic membrane and can
interact with neurotransmitter receptors. Receptors are specific for the neurotransmitter, and the two fit together like a key
and lock. One neurotransmitter binds to its receptor and will not bind to receptors for other neurotransmitters, making the
binding a specific chemical event (Figure 12.27).
