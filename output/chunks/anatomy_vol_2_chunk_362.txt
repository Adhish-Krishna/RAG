For example, in the retina, axons from
RGCs in the fovea are located at the center of the optic nerve, where they are surrounded by axons from the more peripheral
RGCs.

 Spinal Nerves

Generally, spinal nerves contain afferent axons from sensory receptors in the periphery, such as from the skin, mixed with
efferent axons travelling to the muscles or other effector organs. As the spinal nerve nears the spinal cord, it splits into
dorsal and ventral roots. The dorsal root contains only the axons of sensory neurons, whereas the ventral roots contain only
the axons of the motor neurons. Some of the branches will synapse with local neurons in the dorsal root ganglion, posterior
(dorsal) horn, or even the anterior (ventral) horn, at the level of the spinal cord where they enter.
