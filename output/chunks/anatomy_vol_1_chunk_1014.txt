These muscles allow functions, such as swallowing, urination, and defecation, to be under voluntary control. Skeletal
muscles also protect internal organs (particularly abdominal and pelvic organs) by acting as an external barrier or shield to
external trauma and by supporting the weight of the organs.

 Skeletal muscles contribute to the maintenance of homeostasis in the body by generating heat. Muscle contraction
requires energy, and when ATP is broken down, heat is produced. This heat is very noticeable during exercise, when
sustained muscle movement causes body temperature to rise, and in cases of extreme cold, when shivering produces random
skeletal muscle contractions to generate heat.

 Each skeletal muscle is an organ that consists of various integrated tissues. These tissues include the skeletal muscle
fibers, blood vessels, nerve fibers, and connective tissue. Each skeletal muscle has three layers of connective tissue (called
“mysia”) that enclose it and provide structure to the muscle as a whole, and also compartmentalize the muscle fibers within
the muscle (Figure 10.3).
