Instead, the lacunae and osteocytes are found in a lattice-like network of matrix spikes called
trabeculae (singular = trabecula) (Figure 6.13). The trabeculae may appear to be a random network, but each trabecula
forms along lines of stress to provide strength to the bone. The spaces of the trabeculated network provide balance to the
dense and heavy compact bone by making bones lighter so that muscles can move them more easily. In addition, the spaces
in some spongy bones contain red marrow, protected by the trabeculae, where hematopoiesis occurs.
