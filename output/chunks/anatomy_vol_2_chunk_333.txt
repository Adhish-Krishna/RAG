Therefore, hair
cells at the base of the cochlea are activated only by high frequencies, whereas those at the apex of the cochlea are
activated only by low frequencies.

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ear1) to learn more about how the structures of the ear convert sound
waves into a neural signal by moving the “hairs,” or stereocilia, of the cochlear duct. Specific locations along the length
of the duct encode specific frequencies, or pitches. The brain interprets the meaning of the sounds we hear as music,
speech, noise, etc. Which ear structures are responsible for the amplification and transfer of sound from the external
ear to the inner ear?

unroll, with the base at the back of the image and the apex at the front.
