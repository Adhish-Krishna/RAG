Hearing loss is a common result of meningitis.

 The primary test for meningitis is a lumbar puncture. A needle inserted into the lumbar region of the spinal column
through the dura mater and arachnoid membrane into the subarachnoid space can be used to withdraw the fluid for
chemical testing. Fatality occurs in 5 to 40 percent of children and 20 to 50 percent of adults with bacterial meningitis.
 Treatment of bacterial meningitis is through antibiotics, but viral meningitis cannot be treated with antibiotics because
viruses do not respond to that type of drug. Fortunately, the viral forms are milder.

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/lumbarpuncture) that describes the procedure known as the lumbar
puncture, a medical procedure used to sample the CSF. Because of the anatomy of the CNS, it is a relative safe location
to insert a needle. Why is the lumbar puncture performed in the lower lumbar area of the vertebral column?

The Ventricular System

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulates throughout and around the CNS.
