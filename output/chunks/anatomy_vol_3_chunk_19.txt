The apex is the tip of the nose. On either side of the apex, the nostrils are formed by the alae (singular = ala). An ala is
a cartilaginous structure that forms the lateral side of each naris (plural = nares), or nostril opening. The philtrum is the
concave surface that connects the apex of the nose to the upper lip.
