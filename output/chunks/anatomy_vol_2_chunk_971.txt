Despite its prevalence in the general population, the causes of patent ovale are unknown, and there are no known risk
factors. In nonlife-threatening cases, it is better to monitor the condition than to risk heart surgery to repair and seal the
opening.

 Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital abnormal narrowing of the aorta that is normally located at the insertion
of the ligamentum arteriosum, the remnant of the fetal shunt called the ductus arteriosus. If severe, this condition
drastically restricts blood flow through the primary systemic artery, which is life threatening. In some individuals, the
condition may be fairly benign and not detected until later in life. Detectable symptoms in an infant include difficulty
breathing, poor appetite, trouble feeding, or failure to thrive. In older individuals, symptoms include dizziness, fainting,
shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, headache, and nosebleeds. Treatment involves surgery to resect (remove) the
affected region or angioplasty to open the abnormally narrow passageway.
