Figure 24.21 summarizes the metabolic processes occurring in the body during the absorptive state.

@ Digested nutrients enter the

Â® Release of digested nutrients into the
blood stimulates insulin release by the
pancreas. Insulin increases the uptake
of glucose by all body cells, reducing

blood glucose concentration back to

homeostasis.
