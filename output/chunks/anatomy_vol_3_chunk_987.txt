For instance,
circular muscles act as sphincters, closing orifices. 29 Muscles work in pairs to facilitate movement of the bones around the joints.
 Agonists are the prime movers while antagonists oppose or resist the movements of the agonists. Synergists assist the agonists, and
fixators stabilize a muscle’s origin. 30 Agonists are the prime movers while antagonists oppose or resist the movements of the
agonists. Synergists assist the agonists, and fixators stabilize a muscle’s origin. 31 In anatomy and physiology, many word roots
are Latin or Greek. Portions, or roots, of the word give us clues about the function, shape, action, or location of a muscle. 32 Axial
muscles originate on the axial skeleton (the bones in the head, neck, and core of the body), whereas appendicular muscles originate
on the bones that make up the body’s limbs.
