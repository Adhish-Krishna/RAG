The rapid depolarization period
typically lasts 3-5 ms. Depolarization is followed by the plateau phase, in which membrane potential declines relatively

slowly. This is due in large part to the opening of the slow Ca** channels, allowing Ca** to enter the cell while few K*

channels are open, allowing K* to exit the cell. The relatively long plateau phase lasts approximately 175 ms. Once the

membrane potential reaches approximately zero, the Ca** channels close and K* channels open, allowing K* to exit the
cell. The repolarization lasts approximately 75 ms. At this point, membrane potential drops until it reaches resting levels
once more and the cycle repeats. The entire event lasts between 250 and 300 ms (Figure 19.21).

 The absolute refractory period for cardiac contractile muscle lasts approximately 200 ms, and the relative refractory
period lasts approximately 50 ms, for a total of 250 ms.
