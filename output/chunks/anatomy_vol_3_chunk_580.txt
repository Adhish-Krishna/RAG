Blood plasma is the second part of the
ECF. Materials travel between cells and the plasma in capillaries through the IF.

Intracellular Fluid

The ICF lies within cells and is the principal component of the cytosol/cytoplasm. The ICF makes up about 60 percent of
the total water in the human body, and in an average-size adult male, the ICF accounts for about 25 liters (seven gallons)
of fluid (Figure 26.4). This fluid volume tends to be very stable, because the amount of water in living cells is closely
regulated. If the amount of water inside a cell falls to a value that is too low, the cytosol becomes too concentrated with
solutes to carry on normal cellular activities; if too much water enters a cell, the cell may burst and be destroyed.
