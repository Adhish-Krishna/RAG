Sweat glands are another example, which
only receive input from the sympathetic system.

 15.3 Central Control

The autonomic system integrates sensory information and higher cognitive processes to generate output, which balances
homeostatic mechanisms. The central autonomic structure is the hypothalamus, which coordinates sympathetic and
parasympathetic efferent pathways to regulate activities of the organ systems of the body. The majority of hypothalamic
output travels through the medial forebrain bundle and the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus to influence brain stem and spinal
components of the autonomic nervous system. The medial forebrain bundle also connects the hypothalamus with higher
centers of the limbic system where emotion can influence visceral responses. The amygdala is a structure within the limbic
system that influences the hypothalamus in the regulation of the autonomic system, as well as the endocrine system.

 These higher centers have descending control of the autonomic system through brain stem centers, primarily in the
medulla, such as the cardiovascular center.
