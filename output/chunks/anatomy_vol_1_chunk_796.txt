Falls onto the elbow can fracture the distal humerus. A Colles fracture of the distal radius is

the most common forearm fracture.

 Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/colles) to learn about a Colles fracture, a break of the distal radius,
usually caused by falling onto an outstretched hand. When would surgery be required and how would the fracture be
repaired in this case?

300 CHAPTER 8 | THE APPENDICULAR SKELETON

8.3 | The Pelvic Girdle and Pelvis

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Define the pelvic girdle and describe the bones and ligaments of the pelvis
¢ Explain the three regions of the hip bone and identify their bony landmarks
* Describe the openings of the pelvis and the boundaries of the greater and lesser pelvis

The pelvic girdle (hip girdle) is formed by a single bone, the hip bone or coxal bone (coxal = “hip”), which serves as the
attachment point for each lower limb.
