17.11 | Development and Aging of the Endocrine System

 By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the embryonic origins of the endocrine system
 ¢ Discuss the effects of aging on the endocrine system

The endocrine system arises from all three embryonic germ layers. The endocrine glands that produce the steroid hormones,
such as the gonads and adrenal cortex, arise from the mesoderm. In contrast, endocrine glands that arise from the endoderm
and ectoderm produce the amine, peptide, and protein hormones. The pituitary gland arises from two distinct areas of the
ectoderm: the anterior pituitary gland arises from the oral ectoderm, whereas the posterior pituitary gland arises from the
neural ectoderm at the base of the hypothalamus. The pineal gland also arises from the ectoderm. The two structures o
the adrenal glands arise from two different germ layers: the adrenal cortex from the mesoderm and the adrenal medulla
from ectoderm neural cells.
