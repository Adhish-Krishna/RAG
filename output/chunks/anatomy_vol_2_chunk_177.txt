The most significant
connection between the cerebellum and the rest of the brain is at the pons, because the pons and cerebellum develop out of
the same vesicle. The myelencephalon corresponds to the adult structure known as the medulla oblongata. The structures
that come from the mesencephalon and rhombencephalon, except for the cerebellum, are collectively considered the brain
stem, which specifically includes the midbrain, pons, and medulla.
