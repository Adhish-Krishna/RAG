Vestibular division of â€˜ \
vestibulocochlear nerve Head tilted forward

Figure 14.11 Linear Acceleration Coding by Maculae The maculae are specialized for sensing linear acceleration,
such as when gravity acts on the tilting head, or if the head starts moving in a straight line. The difference in inertia
between the hair cell stereocilia and the otolith in which they are embedded leads to a shearing force that causes the
stereocilia to bend in the direction of that linear acceleration.

 The semicircular canals are three ring-like extensions of the vestibule. One is oriented in the horizontal plane, whereas
the other two are oriented in the vertical plane. The anterior and posterior vertical canals are oriented at approximately
45 degrees relative to the sagittal plane (Figure 14.12). The base of each semicircular canal, where it meets with the
vestibule, connects to an enlarged region known as the ampulla.
