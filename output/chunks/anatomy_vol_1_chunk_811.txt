The lesser pelvic cavity of females is also wider and more shallow than the narrower, deeper, and tapering lesser pelvis of
males. Because of the obvious differences between female and male hip bones, this is the one bone of the body that allows
for the most accurate sex determination. Table 8.1 provides an overview of the general differences between the female and
male pelvis.
