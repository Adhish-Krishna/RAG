One of the most distinctive characteristics of leukocytes is their movement. Whereas erythrocytes spend their days
circulating within the blood vessels, leukocytes routinely leave the bloodstream to perform their defensive functions in
the body’s tissues. For leukocytes, the vascular network is simply a highway they travel and soon exit to reach their true
destination. When they arrive, they are often given distinct names, such as macrophage or microglia, depending on their
function. As shown in Figure 18.10, they leave the capillaries—the smallest blood vessels—or other small vessels through
a process known as emigration (from the Latin for “removal”) or diapedesis (dia- = “through”; -pedan = “to leap”) in
which they squeeze through adjacent cells in a blood vessel wall.
