It is important to differentiate between an acute event, such as stroke, and a chronic or global condition such as blunt force
trauma. Responses seen in the neurological exam can help. A loss of language function observed in all its aspects is more
likely a global event as opposed to a discrete loss of one function, such as not being able to say certain types of words.
 A concern, however, is that a specific function—such as controlling the muscles of speech—may mask other language
functions. The various subtests within the mental status exam can address these finer points and help clarify the underlying
cause of the neurological loss.

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/neuroexam2) for an introduction to the neurological exam. Studying
the neurological exam can give insight into how structure and function in the nervous system are interdependent.
 This is a tool both in the clinic and in the classroom, but for different reasons.
