that affect the function of accessory organs—and their abilities to deliver pancreatic enzymes and bile to the small
intestine—include jaundice, acute pancreatitis, cirrhosis, and gallstones.

 In some cases, a single organ is in charge of a digestive process. For example, ingestion occurs only in the mouth and
defecation only in the anus. However, most digestive processes involve the interaction of several organs and occur gradually
as food moves through the alimentary canal (Figure 23.6).
