This region of the brain is concerned with the recognition of visual stimuli and its possible association
with memories. Though the evidence is not yet definitive, this region is likely to be where facial recognition occurs.

 Though this can be a devastating condition, people who suffer from it can get by—often by using other cues to
recognize the people they see. Often, the sound of a person’s voice, or the presence of unique cues such as distinct
facial features (a mole, for example) or hair color can help the sufferer recognize a familiar person. In the video on
prosopagnosia provided in this section, a woman is shown having trouble recognizing celebrities, family members, and
herself. In some situations, she can use other cues to help her recognize faces.

The inability to recognize people by their faces is a troublesome problem. It can be caused by trauma, or it may be
inborn. Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/faces) to learn more about a person who lost the ability to
recognize faces as the result of an injury.
