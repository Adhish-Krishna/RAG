It is common practice in genetics to use capital and lowercase letters to represent dominant and recessive alleles.
 Using Mendelâ€™s pea plants as an example, if a tall pea plant is homozygous, it will possess two tall alleles (TT). A dwar!
pea plant must be homozygous because its dwarfism can only be expressed when two recessive alleles are present (tt). A
heterozygous pea plant (Tt) would be tall and phenotypically indistinguishable from a tall homozygous pea plant because
of the dominant tall allele. Mendel deduced that a 3:1 ratio of dominant to recessive would be produced by the random
segregation of heritable factors (genes) when crossing two heterozygous pea plants. In other words, for any given gene,
parents are equally likely to pass down either one of their alleles to their offspring in a haploid gamete, and the result wil
be expressed in a dominant-recessive pattern if both parents are heterozygous for the trait.
