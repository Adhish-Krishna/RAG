A person with tattoos should be cautious when having a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan because an
MRI machine uses powerful magnets to create images of the soft tissues of the body, which could react with the metals
contained in the tattoo dyes. Watch this video (lttp://openstaxcollege.org/I/tattoo) to learn more about tattooing.

 Sensory Function

The fact that you can feel an ant crawling on your skin, allowing you to flick it off before it bites, is because the skin, and
especially the hairs projecting from hair follicles in the skin, can sense changes in the environment. The hair root plexus
surrounding the base of the hair follicle senses a disturbance, and then transmits the information to the central nervous

system (brain and spinal cord), which can then respond by activating the skeletal muscles of your eyes to see the ant and the
skeletal muscles of the body to act against the ant.
