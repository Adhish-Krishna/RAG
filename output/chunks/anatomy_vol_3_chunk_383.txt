These transporters bind sodium and then bind the amino acid to transport it across the membrane. At the basa
surface of the mucosal cells, the sodium and amino acid are released. The sodium can be reused in the transporter, whereas
the amino acids are transferred into the bloodstream to be transported to the liver and cells throughout the body for protein
synthesis.

 Freely available amino acids are used to create proteins. If amino acids exist in excess, the body has no capacity
or mechanism for their storage; thus, they are converted into glucose or ketones, or they are decomposed. Amino acid
decomposition results in hydrocarbons and nitrogenous waste. However, high concentrations of nitrogen are toxic. The urea
cycle processes nitrogen and facilitates its excretion from the body.

 Urea Cycle

The urea cycle is a set of biochemical reactions that produces urea from ammonium ions in order to prevent a toxic level
of ammonium in the body.
