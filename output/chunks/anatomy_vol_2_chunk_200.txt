Figure 13.9 Frontal Section of Cerebral Cortex and Basal Nuclei The major components of the basal nuclei,
shown in a frontal section of the brain, are the caudate (just lateral to the lateral ventricle), the putamen (inferior to the
caudate and separated by the large white-matter structure called the internal capsule), and the globus pallidus (medial
to the putamen).
