The cycle includes two interrelated processes: oogenesis (the production of female gametes) and folliculogenesis
(the growth and development of ovarian follicles).

 Oogenesis

Gametogenesis in females is called oogenesis. The process begins with the ovarian stem cells, or oogonia (Figure 27.11).
 Oogonia are formed during fetal development, and divide via mitosis, much like spermatogonia in the testis. Unlike
spermatogonia, however, oogonia form primary oocytes in the fetal ovary prior to birth. These primary oocytes are then
arrested in this stage of meiosis I, only to resume it years later, beginning at puberty and continuing until the woman is
near menopause (the cessation of a womanâ€™s reproductive functions). The number of primary oocytes present in the ovaries
declines from one to two million in an infant, to approximately 400,000 at puberty, to zero by the end of menopause.
