The parasympathetic system can also be
referred to as the craniosacral system (or outflow) because the preganglionic neurons are located in nuclei of the brain
stem and the lateral horn of the sacral spinal cord.

 The connections, or “circuits,” of the parasympathetic division are similar to the general layout of the sympathetic
division with a few specific differences (Figure 15.4). The preganglionic fibers from the cranial region travel in cranial
nerves, whereas preganglionic fibers from the sacral region travel in spinal nerves. The targets of these fibers are terminal
ganglia, which are located near—or even within—the target effector. These ganglia are often referred to as intramural
ganglia when they are found within the walls of the target organ. The postganglionic fiber projects from the terminal ganglia
a short distance to the target effector, or to the specific target tissue within the organ. Comparing the relative lengths of
axons in the parasympathetic system, the preganglionic fibers are long and the postganglionic fibers are short because the
ganglia are close to—and sometimes within—the target effectors.
