If the placenta does not birth spontaneously within approximately 30 minutes, it is considered retained, and
the obstetrician may attempt manual removal. If this is not successful, surgery may be required.

 It is important that the obstetrician examines the expelled placenta and fetal membranes to ensure that they are intact.
 If fragments of the placenta remain in the uterus, they can cause postpartum hemorrhage. Uterine contractions continue for
several hours after birth to return the uterus to its pre-pregnancy size in a process called involution, which also allows the
mother’s abdominal organs to return to their pre-pregnancy locations. Breastfeeding facilitates this process.

 Although postpartum uterine contractions limit blood loss from the detachment of the placenta, the mother does
experience a postpartum vaginal discharge called lochia. This is made up of uterine lining cells, erythrocytes, leukocytes,
and other debris. Thick, dark, lochia rubra (red lochia) typically continues for 2—3 days, and is replaced by lochia serosa,
a thinner, pinkish form that continues until about the tenth postpartum day.
