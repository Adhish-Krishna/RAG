The somatosensory function
that would be part of this is the proprioceptive feedback from moving the arm and hand. The weight of the glass, based on
what it contains, will influence how those movements are executed.

 Cognitive Abilities

Assessment of cerebral functions is directed at cognitive abilities. The abilities assessed through the mental status exam
can be separated into four groups: orientation and memory, language and speech, sensorium, and judgment and abstract
reasoning.

 Orientation and Memory

Orientation is the patient’s awareness of his or her immediate circumstances. It is awareness of time, not in terms of the
clock, but of the date and what is occurring around the patient. It is awareness of place, such that a patient should know
where he or she is and why. It is also awareness of who the patient is—recognizing personal identity and being able to relate
that to the examiner.
