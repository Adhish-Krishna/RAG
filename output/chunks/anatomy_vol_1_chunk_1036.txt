This allows the myosin
heads to bind to these exposed binding sites and form cross-bridges. The thin filaments are then pulled by the myosin heads
to slide past the thick filaments toward the center of the sarcomere. But each head can only pull a very short distance before
it has reached its limit and must be “re-cocked” before it can pull again, a step that requires ATP.

 ATP and Muscle Contraction

For thin filaments to continue to slide past thick filaments during muscle contraction, myosin heads must pull the actin at
the binding sites, detach, re-cock, attach to more binding sites, pull, detach, re-cock, etc. This repeated movement is known
as the cross-bridge cycle. This motion of the myosin heads is similar to the oars when an individual rows a boat: The paddle
of the oars (the myosin heads) pull, are lifted from the water (detach), repositioned (re-cocked) and then immersed again to
pull (Figure 10.11).
