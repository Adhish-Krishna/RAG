In addition, the limb can also be rotated around its long axis. This third
movement results in rotation of the limb so that its anterior surface is moved either toward or away from the midline of the
body.

Figure 9.4 Multiaxial Joint A multiaxial joint, such as the hip joint, allows for three types of movement: anterior-
posterior, medial-lateral, and rotational.

 9.2 | Fibrous Joints

 By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the structural features of fibrous joints
¢ Distinguish between a suture, syndesmosis, and gomphosis
* Give an example of each type of fibrous joint

At a fibrous joint, the adjacent bones are directly connected to each other by fibrous connective tissue, and thus the bones
do not have a joint cavity between them (Figure 9.5).
