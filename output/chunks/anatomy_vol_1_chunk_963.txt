A worse combination of injuries can occur with a hit to the lateral side of the extended knee (Figure 9.20). A
moderate blow to the lateral knee will cause the medial side of the joint to open, resulting in stretching or damage to the
tibial collateral ligament. Because the medial meniscus is attached to the tibial collateral ligament, a stronger blow can
tear the ligament and also damage the medial meniscus. This is one reason that the medial meniscus is 20 times more
likely to be injured than the lateral meniscus. A powerful blow to the lateral knee produces a “terrible triad” injury, in
which there is a sequential injury to the tibial collateral ligament, medial meniscus, and anterior cruciate ligament.

 Arthroscopic surgery has greatly improved the surgical treatment of knee injuries and reduced subsequent
recovery times. This procedure involves a small incision and the insertion into the joint of an arthroscope, a pencil-
thin instrument that allows for visualization of the joint interior.
