Upon
entering the spleen, the splenic artery splits into several arterioles (surrounded by white pulp) and eventually into sinusoids.
 Blood from the capillaries subsequently collects in the venous sinuses and leaves via the splenic vein. The red pulp consists
of reticular fibers with fixed macrophages attached, free macrophages, and all of the other cells typical of the blood,
including some lymphocytes. The white pulp surrounds a central arteriole and consists of germinal centers of dividing B
cells surrounded by T cells and accessory cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells. Thus, the red pulp primarily
functions as a filtration system of the blood, using cells of the relatively nonspecific immune response, and white pulp is
where adaptive T and B cell responses are mounted.

 Lymphoid Nodules

The other lymphoid tissues, the lymphoid nodules, have a simpler architecture than the spleen and lymph nodes in that they
consist of a dense cluster of lymphocytes without a surrounding fibrous capsule.
