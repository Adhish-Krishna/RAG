Earth and its atmosphere have provided
us with air to breathe, water to drink, and food to eat, but these are not the only requirements for survival. Although you
may rarely think about it, you also cannot live outside of a certain range of temperature and pressure that the surface of our
planet and its atmosphere provides. The next sections explore these four requirements of life.

Oxygen

Atmospheric air is only about 20 percent oxygen, but that oxygen is a key component of the chemical reactions that keep
the body alive, including the reactions that produce ATP. Brain cells are especially sensitive to lack of oxygen because of
their requirement for a high-and-steady production of ATP. Brain damage is likely within five minutes without oxygen, and
death is likely within ten minutes.

 Nutrients

A nutrient is a substance in foods and beverages that is essential to human survival.
