When climbing the tallest peaks, such as Mt.
Everest and K2 in the Himalayas, many mountain climbers rely upon bottled oxygen as they near the summit.

 Lifecycle of Erythrocytes

Production of erythrocytes in the marrow occurs at the staggering rate of more than 2 million cells per second. For this
production to occur, a number of raw materials must be present in adequate amounts. These include the same nutrients that
are essential to the production and maintenance of any cell, such as glucose, lipids, and amino acids. However, erythrocyte
production also requires several trace elements:

* Iron. We have said that each heme group in a hemoglobin molecule contains an ion of the trace mineral iron. On
average, less than 20 percent of the iron we consume is absorbed. Heme iron, from animal foods such as meat, poultry,
and fish, is absorbed more efficiently than non-heme iron from plant foods.
