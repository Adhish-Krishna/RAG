50 A major mechanism involved in acclimatization is the increased production of erythrocytes. A drop in tissue levels
of oxygen stimulates the kidneys to produce the hormone erythropoietin, which signals the bone marrow to produce erythrocytes.
 As a result, individuals exposed to a high altitude for long periods of time have a greater number of circulating erythrocytes than
do individuals at lower altitudes. 51 At about week 28, enough alveolar precursors have matured so that a baby born prematurely
at this time can usually breathe on its own. Other structures that develop about this time are pulmonary capillaries, expanding
to create a large surface area for gas exchange. Alveolar ducts and alveolar precursors have also developed. 52 Fetal breathing
movements occur due to the contraction of respiratory muscles, causing the fetus to inhale and exhale amniotic fluid. It is thought
that these movements are a way to “practice” breathing, which results in toning the muscles in preparation for breathing after birth.
