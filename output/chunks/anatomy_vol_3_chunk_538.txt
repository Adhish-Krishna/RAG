When blood pressure increases, baroreceptors
send more frequent action potentials to the central nervous system, leading to widespread vasodilation. Included in this
vasodilation are the afferent arterioles supplying the glomerulus, resulting in increased GFR, and water loss by the kidneys.
 If pressure decreases, fewer action potentials travel to the central nervous system, resulting in more sympathetic stimulation-
producing vasoconstriction, which will result in decreased filtration and GFR, and water loss.

 Decreased blood pressure is also sensed by the granular cells in the afferent arteriole of the JGA. In response, the
enzyme renin is released. You saw earlier in the chapter that renin activity leads to an almost immediate rise in blood
pressure as activated angiotensin II produces vasoconstriction. The rise in pressure is sustained by the aldosterone effects

initiated by angiotensin II; this includes an increase in Na‚Äù retention and water volume. As an aside, late in the menstrual
cycle, progesterone has a modest influence on water retention.
