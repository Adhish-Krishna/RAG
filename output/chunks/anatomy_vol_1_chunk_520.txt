 Melanoma

A melanoma is a cancer characterized by the uncontrolled growth of melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells in the
epidermis. Typically, a melanoma develops from a mole. It is the most fatal of all skin cancers, as it is highly metastatic

black patches with uneven borders and a raised surface (Figure 5.20). Treatment typically involves surgical excision and
immunotherapy.
