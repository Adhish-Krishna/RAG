There is no known cure for OI. Treatment focuses on helping the person retain as much independence
as possible while minimizing fractures and maximizing mobility. Toward that end, safe exercises, like swimming, in
which the body is less likely to experience collisions or compressive forces, are recommended. Braces to support legs,
ankles, knees, and wrists are used as needed. Canes, walkers, or wheelchairs can also help compensate for weaknesses.

 When bones do break, casts, splints, or wraps are used. In some cases, metal rods may be surgically implanted
into the long bones of the arms and legs. Research is currently being conducted on using bisphosphonates to treat OI.
Smoking and being overweight are especially risky in people with OI, since smoking is known to weaken bones, and
extra body weight puts additional stress on the bones.
