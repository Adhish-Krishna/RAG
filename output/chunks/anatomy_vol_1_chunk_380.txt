The term tissue is used to describe a group of cells found together in the body. The cells within a tissue share a common
embryonic origin. Microscopic observation reveals that the cells in a tissue share morphological features and are arranged
in an orderly pattern that achieves the tissue’s functions. From the evolutionary perspective, tissues appear in more complex
organisms. For example, multicellular protists, ancient eukaryotes, do not have cells organized into tissues.

 Although there are many types of cells in the human body, they are organized into four broad categories of tissues:
epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that contribute
to the overall health and maintenance of the body.
