All of these motor pathways project to the spinal cord to synapse with motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal
cord. These lower motor neurons are the cells that connect to skeletal muscle and cause contractions. These neurons project
through the spinal nerves to connect to the muscles at neuromuscular junctions. One motor neuron connects to multiple
muscle fibers within a target muscle. The number of fibers that are innervated by a single motor neuron varies on the
basis of the precision necessary for that muscle and the amount of force necessary for that motor unit. The quadriceps, for
example, have many fibers controlled by single motor neurons for powerful contractions that do not need to be precise. The
extraocular muscles have only a small number of fibers controlled by each motor neuron because moving the eyes does not
require much force, but needs to be very precise.
