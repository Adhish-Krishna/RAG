On the other hand, class II MHC molecules are expressed only on the cells of the immune system, specifically cells that
affect other arms of the immune response. Thus, these cells are called “professional” antigen-presenting cells to distinguish
them from those that bear class I MHC. The three types of professional antigen presenters are macrophages, dendritic cells,
and B cells (Table 21.4).

 Macrophages stimulate T cells to release cytokines that enhance phagocytosis. Dendritic cells also kill pathogens
by phagocytosis (see Figure 21.17), but their major function is to bring antigens to regional draining lymph nodes. The
lymph nodes are the locations in which most T cell responses against pathogens of the interstitial tissues are mounted.
 Macrophages are found in the skin and in the lining of mucosal surfaces, such as the nasopharynx, stomach, lungs, and
intestines. B cells may also present antigens to T cells, which are necessary for certain types of antibody responses, to be
covered later in this chapter.
