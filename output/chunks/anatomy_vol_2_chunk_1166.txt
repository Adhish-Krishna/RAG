And if an artery or arteriole dilates
to twice its initial radius, then resistance in the vessel will decrease to 1/16 of its original value and flow will increase 16
times.

 The Roles of Vessel Diameter and Total Area in Blood Flow and Blood Pressure

Recall that we classified arterioles as resistance vessels, because given their small lumen, they dramatically slow the flow
of blood from arteries. In fact, arterioles are the site of greatest resistance in the entire vascular network. This may seem
surprising, given that capillaries have a smaller size. How can this phenomenon be explained?

 Figure 20.13 compares vessel diameter, total cross-sectional area, average blood pressure, and blood velocity through
the systemic vessels. Notice in parts (a) and (b) that the total cross-sectional area of the bodyâ€™s capillary beds is far greater
than any other type of vessel.
