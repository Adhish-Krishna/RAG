An increase in melanocyte-stimulating hormone, in conjunction with estrogens, darkens the areolae and creates a line
of pigment from the umbilicus to the pubis called the linea nigra (Figure 28.19). Melanin production during pregnancy may
also darken or discolor skin on the face to create a chloasma, or “mask of pregnancy.”

Figure 28.19 Linea Nigra The linea nigra, a dark medial line running from the umbilicus to the pubis, forms during
pregnancy and persists for a few weeks following childbirth. The linea nigra shown here corresponds to a pregnancy
that is 22 weeks along.

 Physiology of Labor

Childbirth, or parturition, typically occurs within a week of a woman’s due date, unless the woman is pregnant with more
than one fetus, which usually causes her to go into labor early.
