Sometimes dominance is complete; at other times, it is incomplete. In some cases, both alleles are expressed at the
same time in a form of expression known as codominance.

 In the simplest scenario, a single pair of genes will determine a single heritable characteristic. However, it is quite
common for multiple genes to interact to confer a feature. For instance, eight or more genes—each with their own
alleles—determine eye color in humans. Moreover, although any one person can only have two alleles corresponding to a
given gene, more than two alleles commonly exist in a population. This phenomenon is called multiple alleles. For example,

there are three different alleles that encode ABO blood type; these are designated 4, PB andi.

 Over 100 years of theoretical and experimental genetics studies, and the more recent sequencing and annotation of
the human genome, have helped scientists to develop a better understanding of how an individual’s genotype is expressed
as their phenotype.
