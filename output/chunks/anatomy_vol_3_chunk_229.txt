The initial mixing waves are relatively gentle, but these are followed by more intense waves, starting at the body of the
stomach and increasing in force as they reach the pylorus. It is fair to say that long before your sushi exits through the
pyloric sphincter, it bears little resemblance to the sushi you ate.

 The pylorus, which holds around 30 mL (1 fluid ounce) of chyme, acts as a filter, permitting only liquids and small
food particles to pass through the mostly, but not fully, closed pyloric sphincter. In a process called gastric emptying,
rhythmic mixing waves force about 3 mL of chyme at a time through the pyloric sphincter and into the duodenum. Release
of a greater amount of chyme at one time would overwhelm the capacity of the small intestine to handle it. The rest of
the chyme is pushed back into the body of the stomach, where it continues mixing. This process is repeated when the next
mixing waves force more chyme into the duodenum.
