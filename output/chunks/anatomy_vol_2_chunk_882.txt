[hey are slightly smaller than neutrophils and eosinophils at 8-10 pm in diameter. The granules of basophils stain best with
basic (alkaline) stains. Basophils contain large granules that pick up a dark blue stain and are so common they may make it
difficult to see the two-lobed nucleus.

 In general, basophils intensify the inflammatory response. They share this trait with mast cells. In the past, mast cells
were considered to be basophils that left the circulation. However, this appears not to be the case, as the two cell types
develop from different lineages.

 The granules of basophils release histamines, which contribute to inflammation, and heparin, which opposes blood
clotting. High counts of basophils are associated with allergies, parasitic infections, and hypothyroidism. Low counts are
associated with pregnancy, stress, and hyperthyroidism.

 Agranular Leukocytes

Agranular leukocytes contain smaller, less-visible granules in their cytoplasm than do granular leukocytes.
