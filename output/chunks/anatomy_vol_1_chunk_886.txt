Syndesmosis

A syndesmosis (“fastened with a band”) is a type of fibrous joint in which two parallel bones are united to each other by
fibrous connective tissue. The gap between the bones may be narrow, with the bones joined by ligaments, or the gap may
be wide and filled in by a broad sheet of connective tissue called an interosseous membrane.

 In the forearm, the wide gap between the shaft portions of the radius and ulna bones are strongly united by an
interosseous membrane (see Figure 9.5b). Similarly, in the leg, the shafts of the tibia and fibula are also united by an
interosseous membrane. In addition, at the distal tibiofibular joint, the articulating surfaces of the bones lack cartilage and
the narrow gap between the bones is anchored by fibrous connective tissue and ligaments on both the anterior and posterior
aspects of the joint.
