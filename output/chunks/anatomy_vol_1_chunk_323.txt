This process is called transcription because the mRNA is like a transcript, or copy, 0
the geneâ€™s DNA code. Transcription begins in a fashion somewhat like DNA replication, in that a region of DNA unwinds
and the two strands separate, however, only that small portion of the DNA will be split apart. The triplets within the gene on
this section of the DNA molecule are used as the template to transcribe the complementary strand of RNA (Figure 3.26). A
codon is a three-base sequence of mRNA, so-called because they directly encode amino acids. Like DNA replication, there
are three stages to transcription: initiation, elongation, and termination.

the DNA molecule is transcribed into a complementary MRNA molecule.
