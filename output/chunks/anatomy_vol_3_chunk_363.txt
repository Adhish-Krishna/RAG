Ag/\ng AND THE...

Body’s Metabolic Rate

The human body’s metabolic rate decreases nearly 2 percent per decade after age 30. Changes in body composition,
including reduced lean muscle mass, are mostly responsible for this decrease. The most dramatic loss of muscle mass,
and consequential decline in metabolic rate, occurs between 50 and 70 years of age. Loss of muscle mass is the
equivalent of reduced strength, which tends to inhibit seniors from engaging in sufficient physical activity. This results
in a positive-feedback system where the reduced physical activity leads to even more muscle loss, further reducing
metabolism.
