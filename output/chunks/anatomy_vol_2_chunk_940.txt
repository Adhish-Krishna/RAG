A patient has thalassemia, a genetic disorder
characterized by abnormal synthesis of globin proteins and
excessive destruction of erythrocytes. This patient is
jaundiced and is found to have an excessive level of bilirubin
in his blood. Explain the connection.

34. One of the more common adverse effects of cancer
chemotherapy is the destruction of leukocytes. Before his
next scheduled chemotherapy treatment, a patient undergoes
a blood test called an absolute neutrophil count (ANC),
which reveals that his neutrophil count is 1900 cells per
microliter. Would his healthcare team be likely to proceed
with his chemotherapy treatment? Why?

35. A patient was admitted to the burn unit the previous
evening suffering from a severe burn involving his left upper
extremity and shoulder. A blood test reveals that he is
experiencing leukocytosis. Why is this an expected finding?

36. A lab technician collects a blood sample in a glass tube.
 After about an hour, she harvests serum to continue her
blood analysis.
