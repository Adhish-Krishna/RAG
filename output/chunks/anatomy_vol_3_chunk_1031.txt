33 The patient’s blood would flow more sluggishly from
the arteriole into the capillary bed. Thus, the patient’s capillary hydrostatic pressure would be below the normal 35 mm Hg at the
arterial end. At the same time, the patient’s blood colloidal osmotic pressure is normal—about 25 mm Hg. Thus, even at the arterial
end of the capillary bed, the net filtration pressure would be below 10 mm Hg, and an abnormally reduced level of filtration would
occur. In fact, reabsorption might begin to occur by the midpoint of the capillary bed. 34 False. The plasma proteins suspended

in blood cannot cross the semipermeable capillary cell membrane, and so they remain in the plasma within the vessel, where they
account for the blood colloid osmotic pressure.
