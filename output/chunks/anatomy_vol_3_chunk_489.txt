will find osmotic pressure exerted by the solutes inside the lumen of the capillary as well as inside of Bowman’s capsule.
 Since the filtration membrane limits the size of particles crossing the membrane, the osmotic pressure inside the glomerular
capillary is higher than the osmotic pressure in Bowman’s capsule. Recall that cells and the medium-to-large proteins cannot
pass between the podocyte processes or through the fenestrations of the capillary endothelial cells. This means that red and

white blood cells, platelets, albumins, and other proteins too large to pass through the filter remain in the capillary, creating
an average colloid osmotic pressure of 30 mm Hg within the capillary. The absence of proteins in Bowman’s space (the
lumen within Bowman’s capsule) results in an osmotic pressure near zero. Thus, the only pressure moving fluid across the
capillary wall into the lumen of Bowman’s space is hydrostatic pressure.
