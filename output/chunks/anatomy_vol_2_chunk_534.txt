This collection of medullary nuclei regulates cardiac function, as well as blood
pressure. Sensory input from the heart, aorta, and carotid sinuses project to these regions of the medulla. The solitary
nucleus increases sympathetic tone of the cardiovascular system through the cardiac accelerator and vasomotor nerves. The
nucleus ambiguus and the dorsal motor nucleus both contribute fibers to the vagus nerve, which exerts parasympathetic
control of the heart by decreasing heart rate.

CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 643

15.4 Drugs that Affect the Autonomic System

The autonomic system is affected by a number of exogenous agents, including some that are therapeutic and some that are
illicit. These drugs affect the autonomic system by mimicking or interfering with the endogenous agents or their receptors.
 A survey of how different drugs affect autonomic function illustrates the role that the neurotransmitters and hormones play
in autonomic function.
