The
countercurrent term comes from the fact that the descending and ascending loops are next to each other and their fluid flows
in opposite directions (countercurrent). The multiplier term is due to the action of solute pumps that increase (multiply) the

concentrations of urea and Na” deep in the medulla.

As discussed above, the ascending loop has many Na* pumps that actively pump Na* out of the forming urine into
the interstitial spaces. In addition, collecting ducts have urea pumps that actively pump urea into the interstitial spaces. This

results in the recovery of Na” to the circulation via the vasa recta and creates a high osmolar environment in the depths of
the medulla.

 Ammonia (NH3) is a toxic byproduct of protein metabolism. It is formed as amino acids are deaminated by liver
hepatocytes. That means that the amine group, NH2, is removed from amino acids as they are broken down.
