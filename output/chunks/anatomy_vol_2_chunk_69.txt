“star”). Astrocytes have many processes extending from their main cell body (not axons or dendrites
like neurons, just cell extensions). Those processes extend to interact with neurons, blood vessels, or the connective tissue
covering the CNS that is called the pia mater (Figure 12.11). Generally, they are supporting cells for the neurons in the
central nervous system. Some ways in which they support neurons in the central nervous system are by maintaining the
concentration of chemicals in the extracellular space, removing excess signaling molecules, reacting to tissue damage,
and contributing to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The blood-brain barrier is a physiological barrier that keeps many
substances that circulate in the rest of the body from getting into the central nervous system, restricting what can cross from
circulating blood into the CNS.
