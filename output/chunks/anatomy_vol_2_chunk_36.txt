Figure 12.2 Central and Peripheral Nervous System The structures of the PNS are referred to as ganglia and
nerves, which can be seen as distinct structures. The equivalent structures in the CNS are not obvious from this overall
perspective and are best examined in prepared tissue under the microscope.

 Nervous tissue, present in both the CNS and PNS, contains two basic types of cells: neurons and glial cells. A glial
cell is one of a variety of cells that provide a framework of tissue that supports the neurons and their activities. The neuron
is the more functionally important of the two, in terms of the communicative function of the nervous system. To describe
the functional divisions of the nervous system, it is important to understand the structure of a neuron.
