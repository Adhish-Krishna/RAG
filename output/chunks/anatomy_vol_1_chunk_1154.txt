Although the masseter and temporalis are responsible for elevating and closing the jaw to break food into digestible
pieces, the medial pterygoid and lateral pterygoid muscles provide assistance in chewing and moving food within the

mouth.

 Muscles That Move the Tongue

 Although the tongue is obviously important for tasting food, it is also necessary for mastication, deglutition (swallowing),
and speech (Figure 11.11 and Figure 11.12). Because it is so moveable, the tongue facilitates complex speech patterns and

sounds.
