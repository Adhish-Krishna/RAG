Other overlooked senses include temperature perception by
thermoreceptors and pain perception by nociceptors.

 Within the realm of physiology, senses can be classified as either general or specific. A general sense is one that is
distributed throughout the body and has receptor cells within the structures of other organs. Mechanoreceptors in the skin,
muscles, or the walls of blood vessels are examples of this type. General senses often contribute to the sense of touch, as
described above, or to proprioception (body movement) and kinesthesia (body movement), or to a visceral sense, which

is most important to autonomic functions. A special sense is one that has a specific organ devoted to it, namely the eye,
inner ear, tongue, or nose.

 Each of the senses is referred to as a sensory modality. Modality refers to the way that information is encoded, which
is similar to the idea of transduction.
