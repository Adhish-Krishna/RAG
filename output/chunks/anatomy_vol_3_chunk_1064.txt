25 The sperm must swim upward in the vagina, through the cervix, and then through the body of the uterus to one
or the other of the two uterine tubes. Fertilization generally occurs in the uterine tube. 26 Meiosis in the man results in four
viable haploid sperm, whereas meiosis in the woman results in a secondary oocyte and, upon completion following fertilization
by a sperm, one viable haploid ovum with abundant cytoplasm and up to three polar bodies with little cytoplasm that are destined
to die. 27 Asa result of the degradation of the corpus luteum, a decline in progesterone concentrations triggers the shedding
of the endometrial lining, marking the menses phase of the menstrual cycle. Low progesterone levels also reduce the negative
feedback that had been occurring at the hypothalamus and pituitary, and result in the release of GnRH and, subsequently, FSH
and LH.
