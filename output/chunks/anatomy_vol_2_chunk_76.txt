It also includes important proteins that are integral to that membrane. Some of the proteins help
to hold the layers of the glial cell membrane closely together.

 The appearance of the myelin sheath can be thought of as similar to the pastry wrapped around a hot dog for “pigs in
a blanket” or a similar food. The glial cell is wrapped around the axon several times with little to no cytoplasm between the
glial cell layers. For oligodendrocytes, the rest of the cell is separate from the myelin sheath as a cell process extends back
toward the cell body. A few other processes provide the same insulation for other axon segments in the area. For Schwann
cells, the outermost layer of the cell membrane contains cytoplasm and the nucleus of the cell as a bulge on one side of the
myelin sheath. During development, the glial cell is loosely or incompletely wrapped around the axon (Figure 12.13a). The
