The loops
of cortical nephrons do not extend into the renal medulla very far, if at all. Juxtamedullary nephrons have loops that
extend variable distances, some very deep into the medulla. The descending and ascending portions of the loop are highly
specialized to enable recovery of much of the Na* and water that were filtered by the glomerulus. As the forming urine
moves through the loop, the osmolarity will change from isosmotic with blood (about 278-300 mOsmol/kg) to both a very
hypertonic solution of about 1200 mOsmol/kg and a very hypotonic solution of about 100 mOsmol/kg. These changes are
accomplished by osmosis in the descending limb and active transport in the ascending limb. Solutes and water recovered
from these loops are returned to the circulation by way of the vasa recta.

 Descending Loop

The majority of the descending loop is comprised of simple squamous epithelial cells; to simplify the function of the loop,
this discussion focuses on these cells.
