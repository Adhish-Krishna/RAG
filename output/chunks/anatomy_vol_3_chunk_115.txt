In fact,
hemoglobin saturation is lower at high altitudes compared to hemoglobin saturation at sea level. For example, hemoglobin
saturation is about 67 percent at 19,000 feet above sea level, whereas it reaches about 98 percent at sea level.

As you recall, partial pressure is extremely important in determining how much gas can cross the respiratory membrane
and enter the blood of the pulmonary capillaries.
