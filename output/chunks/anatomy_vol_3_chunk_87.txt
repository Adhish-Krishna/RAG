External Respiration

The pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood into the lungs from the heart, where it branches and eventually becomes
the capillary network composed of pulmonary capillaries. These pulmonary capillaries create the respiratory membrane
with the alveoli (Figure 22.22). As the blood is pumped through this capillary network, gas exchange occurs. Although a
small amount of the oxygen is able to dissolve directly into plasma from the alveoli, most of the oxygen is picked up by
erythrocytes (red blood cells) and binds to a protein called hemoglobin, a process described later in this chapter. Oxygenated
hemoglobin is red, causing the overall appearance of bright red oxygenated blood, which returns to the heart through the
pulmonary veins. Carbon dioxide is released in the opposite direction of oxygen, from the blood to the alveoli. Some of
the carbon dioxide is returned on hemoglobin, but can also be dissolved in plasma or is present as a converted form, also
explained in greater detail later in this chapter.
