THE TISSUE LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION

epithelial membrane epithelium attached to a layer of connective tissue

epithelial tissue type of tissue that serves primarily as a covering or lining of body parts, protecting the body; it also
functions in absorption, transport, and secretion

exocrine gland group of epithelial cells that secrete substances through ducts that open to the skin or to internal body
surfaces that lead to the exterior of the body

fibroblast most abundant cell type in connective tissue, secretes protein fibers and matrix into the extracellular space

fibrocartilage tough form of cartilage, made of thick bundles of collagen fibers embedded in chondroitin sulfate
ground substance

fibrocyte less active form of fibroblast

fluid connective tissue specialized cells that circulate in a watery fluid containing salts, nutrients, and dissolved
proteins

gap junction allows cytoplasmic communications to occur between cells
goblet cell unicellular gland found in columnar epithelium that secretes mucous
ground substance fluid or semi-fluid portion of the matrix

histamine chemical compound released by mast cells in response to injury that causes vasodilation and endothelium
permeability

histology microscopic study of tissue architecture, organization, and function
holocrine secretion release of a substance caused by the rupture of a gland cell, which becomes part of the secretion

hyaline cartilage most common type of cartilage, smooth and made of short collagen fibers embedded in a chondroitin
sulfate ground substance

inflammation response of tissue to injury
lacunae (singular = lacuna) small spaces in bone or cartilage tissue that cells occupy
lamina propria areolar connective tissue underlying a mucous membrane

loose connective tissue (also, areolar tissue) type of connective tissue proper that shows little specialization with
cells dispersed in the matrix

matrix extracellular material which is produced by the cells embedded in it, containing ground substance and fibers
merocrine secretion release of a substance from a gland via exocytosis

mesenchymal cell adult stem cell from which most connective tissue cells are derived

mesenchyme embryonic tissue from which connective tissue cells derive

mesoderm middle embryonic germ layer from which connective tissue, muscle tissue, and some epithelial tissue derive

mesothelium simple squamous epithelial tissue which covers the major body cavities and is the epithelial portion of
serous membranes

mucous connective tissue specialized loose connective tissue present in the umbilical cord

mucous gland group of cells that secrete mucous, a thick, slippery substance that keeps tissues moist and acts as a
lubricant

mucous membrane tissue membrane that is covered by protective mucous and lines tissue exposed to the outside
environment

muscle tissue type of tissue that is capable of contracting and generating tension in response to stimulation; produces
movement.
