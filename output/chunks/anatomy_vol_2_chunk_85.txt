You have learned about this type of signaling before, with
respect to the interaction of nerves and muscles at the neuromuscular junction. The voltage at which such a signal is
generated is called the threshold, and the resulting electrical signal is called an action potential. In this example, the
action potential travels—a process known as propagation—along the axon from the axon hillock to the axon terminals and
into the synaptic end bulbs. When this signal reaches the end bulbs, it causes the release of a signaling molecule called a
neurotransmitter.

 The neurotransmitter diffuses across the short distance of the synapse and binds to a receptor protein of the target
neuron. When the molecular signal binds to the receptor, the cell membrane of the target neuron changes its electrical state
and a new graded potential begins.
