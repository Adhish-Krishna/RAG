In a clinical setting, sodium, potassium, and chloride are typically analyzed in a routine urine sample. In
contrast, calcium and phosphate analysis requires a collection of urine across a 24-hour period, because the output of these
ions can vary considerably over the course of a day. Urine values reflect the rates of excretion of these ions. Bicarbonate
is the one ion that is not normally excreted in urine; instead, it is conserved by the kidneys for use in the body’s buffering
systems.
