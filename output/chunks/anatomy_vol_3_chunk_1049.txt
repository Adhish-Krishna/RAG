44 Nutrients from the breakdown of carbohydrates and proteins are absorbed through a capillary bed in the villi of
the small intestine. Lipid breakdown products are absorbed into a lacteal in the villi, and transported via the lymphatic system to
the bloodstream. 45 If large quantities of chyme were forced into the small intestine, it would result in osmotic water loss from the
blood into the intestinal lumen that could cause potentially life-threatening low blood volume and erosion of the duodenum. 46
The mucosa of the small intestine includes circular folds, villi, and microvilli. The wall of the large intestine has a thick mucosal
layer, and deeper and more abundant mucus-secreting glands that facilitate the smooth passage of feces. There are three features
that are unique to the large intestine: teniae coli, haustra, and epiploic appendages. 47 The pancreas secretes protein-digesting
enzymes in their inactive forms. If secreted in their active forms, they would self-digest the pancreas.
