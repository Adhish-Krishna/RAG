An interesting consequence of Rh factor expression is seen in erythroblastosis fetalis, a hemolytic disease of the
newborn (Figure 21.30). This disease occurs when mothers negative for Rh antigen have multiple Rh-positive children.
 During the birth of a first Rh-positive child, the mother makes a primary anti-Rh antibody response to the fetal blood cells
that enter the maternal bloodstream. If the mother has a second Rh-positive child, IgG antibodies against Rh-positive blood
mounted during this secondary response cross the placenta and attack the fetal blood, causing anemia. This is a consequence
of the fact that the fetus is not genetically identical to the mother, and thus the mother is capable of mounting an immune
response against it. This disease is treated with antibodies specific for Rh factor. These are given to the mother during the
subsequent births, destroying any fetal blood that might enter her system and preventing the immune response.
