Everyday CONNECTION

Left Brain, Right Brain

Popular media often refer to right-brained and left-brained people, as if the brain were two independent halves that
work differently for different people. This is a popular misinterpretation of an important neurological phenomenon. As
an extreme measure to deal with a debilitating condition, the corpus callosum may be sectioned to overcome intractable
epilepsy. When the connections between the two cerebral hemispheres are cut, interesting effects can be observed.

 If a person with an intact corpus callosum is asked to put their hands in their pockets and describe what is there
on the basis of what their hands feel, they might say that they have keys in their right pocket and loose change in the
left. They may even be able to count the coins in their pocket and say if they can afford to buy a candy bar from the
vending machine.
