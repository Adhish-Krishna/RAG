 Intercalated discs are part of the sarcolemma and contain two structures important in cardiac muscle contraction:
gap junctions and desmosomes. A gap junction forms channels between adjacent cardiac muscle fibers that allow the
depolarizing current produced by cations to flow from one cardiac muscle cell to the next. This joining is called electric
coupling, and in cardiac muscle it allows the quick transmission of action potentials and the coordinated contraction of
the entire heart. This network of electrically connected cardiac muscle cells creates a functional unit of contraction called
a syncytium. The remainder of the intercalated disc is composed of desmosomes. A desmosome is a cell structure that
anchors the ends of cardiac muscle fibers together so the cells do not pull apart during the stress of individual fibers
contracting (Figure 10.22).
