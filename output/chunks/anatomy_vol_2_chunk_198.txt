Subcortical structures

Beneath the cerebral cortex are sets of nuclei known as subcortical nuclei that augment cortical processes. The nuclei of the
basal forebrain serve as the primary location for acetylcholine production, which modulates the overall activity of the cortex,
possibly leading to greater attention to sensory stimuli. Alzheimerâ€™s disease is associated with a loss of neurons in the basal
forebrain. The hippocampus and amygdala are medial-lobe structures that, along with the adjacent cortex, are involved
in long-term memory formation and emotional responses. The basal nuclei are a set of nuclei in the cerebrum responsible
for comparing cortical processing with the general state of activity in the nervous system to influence the likelihood of
movement taking place. For example, while a student is sitting in a classroom listening to a lecture, the basal nuclei will
keep the urge to jump up and scream from actually happening.
