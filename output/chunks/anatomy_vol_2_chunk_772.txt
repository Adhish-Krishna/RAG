The roles of the gonadotropins released from the anterior pituitary
(FSH and LH) were discussed earlier.

 The primary hormone produced by the male testes is testosterone, a steroid hormone important in the development of
the male reproductive system, the maturation of sperm cells, and the development of male secondary sex characteristics such
as a deepened voice, body hair, and increased muscle mass. Interestingly, testosterone is also produced in the female ovaries,
but at a much reduced level. In addition, the testes produce the peptide hormone inhibin, which inhibits the secretion of
FSH from the anterior pituitary gland. FSH stimulates spermatogenesis.

 The primary hormones produced by the ovaries are estrogens, which include estradiol, estriol, and estrone. Estrogens
play an important role in a larger number of physiological processes, including the development of the female reproductive
system, regulation of the menstrual cycle, the development of female secondary sex characteristics such as increased
adipose tissue and the development of breast tissue, and the maintenance of pregnancy.
