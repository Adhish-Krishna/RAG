This hormone is produced in the hypothalamus and is delivered to the posterior pituitary for
storage and release (Figure 26.11). When the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus detect an increase in the concentration of
blood plasma, the hypothalamus signals the release of ADH from the posterior pituitary into the blood.

Figure 26.11 Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) ADH is produced in the hypothalamus and released by the posterior
pituitary gland. It causes the kidneys to retain water, constricts arterioles in the peripheral circulation, and affects some
social behaviors in mammals.

 ADH has two major effects. It constricts the arterioles in the peripheral circulation, which reduces the flow of blood to
the extremities and thereby increases the blood supply to the core of the body.
