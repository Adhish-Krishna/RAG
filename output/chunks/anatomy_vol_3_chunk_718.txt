The Uterine Tubes

The uterine tubes (also called fallopian tubes or oviducts) serve as the conduit of the oocyte from the ovary to the uterus
(Figure 27.14). Each of the two uterine tubes is close to, but not directly connected to, the ovary and divided into sections.
 The isthmus is the narrow medial end of each uterine tube that is connected to the uterus. The wide distal infundibulum
flares out with slender, finger-like projections called fimbriae. The middle region of the tube, called the ampulla, is where
fertilization often occurs. The uterine tubes also have three layers: an outer serosa, a middle smooth muscle layer, and an
inner mucosal layer. In addition to its mucus-secreting cells, the inner mucosa contains ciliated cells that beat in the direction
of the uterus, producing a current that will be critical to move the oocyte.
