Pleural fluid is secreted by mesothelial cells from both pleural layers and acts to lubricate their surfaces. This lubrication
reduces friction between the two layers to prevent trauma during breathing, and creates surface tension that helps maintain
the position of the lungs against the thoracic wall. This adhesive characteristic of the pleural fluid causes the lungs to
enlarge when the thoracic wall expands during ventilation, allowing the lungs to fill with air. The pleurae also create a
division between major organs that prevents interference due to the movement of the organs, while preventing the spread of
infection.
