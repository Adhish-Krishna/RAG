In contrast, forced breathing, also known as hyperpnea, is a mode of breathing that can occur during exercise
or actions that require the active manipulation of breathing, such as singing. During forced breathing, inspiration and
expiration both occur due to muscle contractions. In addition to the contraction of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles,
other accessory muscles must also contract. During forced inspiration, muscles of the neck, including the scalenes, contract
and lift the thoracic wall, increasing lung volume. During forced expiration, accessory muscles of the abdomen, including
the obliques, contract, forcing abdominal organs upward against the diaphragm. This helps to push the diaphragm further

into the thorax, pushing more air out. In addition, accessory muscles (primarily the internal intercostals) help to compress
the rib cage, which also reduces the volume of the thoracic cavity.
