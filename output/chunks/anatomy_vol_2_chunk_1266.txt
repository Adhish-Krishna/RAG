Smaller vein complementary to the azygos vein; drains the esophageal veins from the
Hemiazygos ; - : - a
vein esophagus and the left intercostal veins, and leads to the brachiocephalic vein via the
superior intercostal vein

Veins of the Head and Neck

Blood from the brain and the superficial facial vein flow into each internal jugular vein (Figure 20.37). Blood from the
more superficial portions of the head, scalp, and cranial regions, including the temporal vein and maxillary vein, flow into
each external jugular vein. Although the external and internal jugular veins are separate vessels, there are anastomoses
between them close to the thoracic region. Blood from the external jugular vein empties into the subclavian vein. Table
20.12 summarizes the major veins of the head and neck.

 Major Veins of the Head and Neck

Vessel Description

Parallel to the common carotid artery, which is more or less its counterpart, and passes
through the jugular foramen and canal; primarily drains blood from the brain, receives the
superficial facial vein, and empties into the subclavian vein

Internal jugular
vein

Temporal vein | Drains blood from the temporal region and flows into the external jugular vein

Maxillary vein Drains blood from the maxillary region and flows into the external jugular vein

Drains blood from the more superficial portions of the head, scalp, and cranial regions, and
leads to the subclavian vein

External jugular
vein

Venous Drainage of the Brain

Circulation to the brain is both critical and complex (see Figure 20.37).
