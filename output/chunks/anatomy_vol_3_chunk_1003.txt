31 The prefrontal cortex is involved in decision-making
functions that lead to motor responses through connections to the more posterior motor regions. These early aspects of behavior are
often associated with a personâ€™s personality, so disrupting those connections will lead to severe changes in behavior. 32 Though

system and can be used to quickly assess the state of neurological function for a person.

endocrine system is also responsible for responses to stress in our lives. The hypothalamus coordinates the autonomic response
through projections into the spinal cord and through influence over the pituitary gland, the effective center of the endocrine
system. 3 The effect of gravity on circulation means that it is harder to get blood up from the legs as the body takes on a
vertical orientation.
