CHAPTER 26 | FLUID, ELECTROLYTE, AND ACID-BASE BALANCE 1177

The body has other water-based ECF. These include the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord,
lymph, the synovial fluid in joints, the pleural fluid in the pleural cavities, the pericardial fluid in the cardiac sac, the
peritoneal fluid in the peritoneal cavity, and the aqueous humor of the eye. Because these fluids are outside of cells, these
fluids are also considered components of the ECF compartment.

 Composition of Body Fluids

The compositions of the two components of the ECF—plasma and IF—are more similar to each other than either is to
the ICF (Figure 26.5). Blood plasma has high concentrations of sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and protein. The IF has
high concentrations of sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate, but a relatively lower concentration of protein.
