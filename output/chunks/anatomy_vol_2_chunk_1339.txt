Secondary Lymphoid Organs and their Roles in Active Immune Responses

Lymphocytes develop and mature in the primary lymphoid organs, but they mount immune responses from the secondary
lymphoid organs. A naive lymphocyte is one that has left the primary organ and entered a secondary lymphoid organ.
 Naive lymphocytes are fully functional immunologically, but have yet to encounter an antigen to respond to. In addition
to circulating in the blood and lymph, lymphocytes concentrate in secondary lymphoid organs, which include the lymph
nodes, spleen, and lymphoid nodules. All of these tissues have many features in common, including the following:
* The presence of lymphoid follicles, the sites of the formation of lymphocytes, with specific B cell-rich and T cell-rich
areas

¢ An internal structure of reticular fibers with associated fixed macrophages

* Germinal centers, which are the sites of rapidly dividing B lymphocytes and plasma cells, with the exception of the
spleen

¢ Specialized post-capillary vessels known as high endothelial venules; the cells lining these venules are thicker and
more columnar than normal endothelial cells, which allow cells from the blood to directly enter these tissues

Lymph Nodes

Lymph nodes function to remove debris and pathogens from the lymph, and are thus sometimes referred to as the “filters
of the lymph” (Figure 21.8).
