However, some aspects of the somatic system
use voluntary muscles without conscious control. One example is the ability of our breathing to switch to unconscious
control while we are focused on another task. However, the muscles that are responsible for the basic process of breathing
are also utilized for speech, which is entirely voluntary.

 Cortical Responses

Letâ€™s start with sensory stimuli that have been registered through receptor cells and the information relayed to the CNS along
ascending pathways. In the cerebral cortex, the initial processing of sensory perception progresses to associative processing
and then integration in multimodal areas of cortex. These levels of processing can lead to the incorporation of sensory
perceptions into memory, but more importantly, they lead to a response. The completion of cortical processing through the
primary, associative, and integrative sensory areas initiates a similar progression of motor processing, usually in different
cortical areas.
