In this case, there is a rapid depolarization,
followed by a plateau phase and then repolarization. This phenomenon accounts for the long refractory periods required
for the cardiac muscle cells to pump blood effectively before they are capable of firing for a second time. These cardiac
myocytes normally do not initiate their own electrical potential, although they are capable of doing so, but rather wait for
an impulse to reach them.

 Contractile cells demonstrate a much more stable resting phase than conductive cells at approximately -80 mV for
cells in the atria and -90 mV for cells in the ventricles. Despite this initial difference, the other components of their action
potentials are virtually identical. In both cases, when stimulated by an action potential, voltage-gated channels rapidly
open, beginning the positive-feedback mechanism of depolarization. This rapid influx of positively charged ions raises the
membrane potential to approximately +30 mV, at which point the sodium channels close.
