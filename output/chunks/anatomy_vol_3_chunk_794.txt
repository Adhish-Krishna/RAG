When implantation succeeds and the blastocyst adheres to the endometrium, the superficial cells of the trophoblast fuse
with each other, forming the syncytiotrophoblast, a multinucleated body that digests endometrial cells to firmly secure the
blastocyst to the uterine wall. In response, the uterine mucosa rebuilds itself and envelops the blastocyst (Figure 28.6). The
trophoblast secretes human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone that directs the corpus luteum to survive, enlarge,
and continue producing progesterone and estrogen to suppress menses. These functions of hCG are necessary for creating an
environment suitable for the developing embryo. As a result of this increased production, hCG accumulates in the maternal
bloodstream and is excreted in the urine. Implantation is complete by the middle of the second week. Just a few days after
implantation, the trophoblast has secreted enough hCG for an at-home urine pregnancy test to give a positive result.
