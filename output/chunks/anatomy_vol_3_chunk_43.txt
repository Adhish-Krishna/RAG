Fissures separate these lobes from each other. The right lung
consists of three lobes: the superior, middle, and inferior lobes. The left lung consists of two lobes: the superior and inferior
lobes. A bronchopulmonary segment is a division of a lobe, and each lobe houses multiple bronchopulmonary segments.
 Each segment receives air from its own tertiary bronchus and is supplied with blood by its own artery. Some diseases of the
lungs typically affect one or more bronchopulmonary segments, and in some cases, the diseased segments can be surgically
removed with little influence on neighboring segments. A pulmonary lobule is a subdivision formed as the bronchi branch
into bronchioles. Each lobule receives its own large bronchiole that has multiple branches. An interlobular septum is a wall,
composed of connective tissue, which separates lobules from one another.

 Blood Supply and Nervous Innervation of the Lungs

The blood supply of the lungs plays an important role in gas exchange and serves as a transport system for gases throughout
the body.
