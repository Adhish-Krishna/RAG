However, cardiac and smooth muscle cells are not multinucleate because the myoblasts
that form their cells do not fuse.

 Gap junctions develop in the cardiac and single-unit smooth muscle in the early stages of development. In skeletal
muscles, ACh receptors are initially present along most of the surface of the myoblasts, but spinal nerve innervation

causes the release of growth factors that stimulate the formation of motor end-plates and NMJs. As neurons become active,
electrical signals that are sent through the muscle influence the distribution of slow and fast fibers in the muscle.

 Although the number of muscle cells is set during development, satellite cells help to repair skeletal muscle cells. A
satellite cell is similar to a myoblast because it is a type of stem cell; however, satellite cells are incorporated into muscle
cells and facilitate the protein synthesis required for repair and growth.
