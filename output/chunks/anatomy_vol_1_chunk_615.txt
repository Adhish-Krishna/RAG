Blood vessels and nerves enter the bone
through the nutrient foramina to nourish and innervate bones.

6.4 Bone Formation and Development

All bone formation is a replacement process. Embryos develop a cartilaginous skeleton and various membranes. During
development, these are replaced by bone during the ossification process. In intramembranous ossification, bone develops
directly from sheets of mesenchymal connective tissue. In endochondral ossification, bone develops by replacing hyaline
cartilage. Activity in the epiphyseal plate enables bones to grow in length. Modeling allows bones to grow in diameter.
 Remodeling occurs as bone is resorbed and replaced by new bone. Osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetic disease in which
collagen production is altered, resulting in fragile, brittle bones.

6.5 Fractures: Bone Repair

Fractured bones may be repaired by closed reduction or open reduction. Fractures are classified by their complexity,
location, and other features. Common types of fractures are transverse, oblique, spiral, comminuted, impacted, greenstick,
open (or compound), and closed (or simple).
