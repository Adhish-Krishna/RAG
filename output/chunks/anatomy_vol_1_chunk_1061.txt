The last phase is

the relaxation phase, when tension decreases as contraction stops. Ca‚Äù ions are pumped out of the sarcoplasm into the
SR, and cross-bridge cycling stops, returning the muscle fibers to their resting state.

Figure 10.15 A Myogram of a Muscle Twitch A single muscle twitch has a latent period, a contraction phase when
tension increases, and a relaxation phase when tension decreases. During the latent period, the action potential is
being propagated along the sarcolemma. During the contraction phase, Ca** ions in the sarcoplasm bind to troponin,
tropomyosin moves from actin-binding sites, cross-bridges form, and sarcomeres shorten.
