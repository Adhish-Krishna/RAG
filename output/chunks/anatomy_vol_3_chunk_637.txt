26.5 | Disorders of Acid-Base Balance

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Identify the three blood variables considered when making a diagnosis of acidosis or alkalosis
¢ Identify the source of compensation for blood pH problems of a respiratory origin
 ¢ Identify the source of compensation for blood pH problems of a metabolic/renal origin

Normal arterial blood pH is restricted to a very narrow range of 7.35 to 7.45. A person who has a blood pH below 7.35 is
considered to be in acidosis (actually, “physiological acidosis,” because blood is not truly acidic until its pH drops below
7), and a continuous blood pH below 7.0 can be fatal. Acidosis has several symptoms, including headache and confusion,
and the individual can become lethargic and easily fatigued (Figure 26.18). A person who has a blood pH above 7.45 is
considered to be in alkalosis, and a pH above 7.8 is fatal.
