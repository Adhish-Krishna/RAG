Calcium ions, for example, are essential for muscle contractions and controlling the flow of other ions involved
in the transmission of nerve impulses.

 Bone also serves as a site for fat storage and blood cell production. The softer connective tissue that fills the interior of
most bone is referred to as bone marrow (Figure 6.5). There are two types of bone marrow: yellow marrow and red marrow.
 Yellow marrow contains adipose tissue; the triglycerides stored in the adipocytes of the tissue can serve as a source of
energy. Red marrow is where hematopoiesis—the production of blood cells—takes place. Red blood cells, white blood
cells, and platelets are all produced in the red marrow.
