Common causes of acidosis are situations
and disorders that reduce the effectiveness of breathing, especially the personâ€™s ability to exhale fully, which causes a

buildup of COz (and H*) in the bloodstream. Acidosis can also be caused by metabolic problems that reduce the level
or function of buffers that act as bases, or that promote the production of acids. For instance, with severe diarrhea,
too much bicarbonate can be lost from the body, allowing acids to build up in body fluids. In people with poorly
managed diabetes (ineffective regulation of blood sugar), acids called ketones are produced as a form of body fuel.
 These can build up in the blood, causing a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. Kidney failure, liver failure,
heart failure, cancer, and other disorders also can prompt metabolic acidosis.

 In contrast, alkalosis is a condition in which the blood and other body fluids are too alkaline (basic).
