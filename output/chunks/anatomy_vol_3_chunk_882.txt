This holds true except when two alleles happen to be located close to one other on the same chromosome.
 Independent assortment provides for a great degree of diversity in offspring.

 Mendelian genetics represent the fundamentals of inheritance, but there are two important qualifiers to consider when
applying Mendel’s findings to inheritance studies in humans. First, as we’ve already noted, not all genes are inherited in
a dominant-recessive pattern. Although all diploid individuals have two alleles for every gene, allele pairs may interact to
create several types of inheritance patterns, including incomplete dominance and codominance.

 Secondly, Mendel performed his studies using thousands of pea plants. He was able to identify a 3:1 phenotypic ratio
in second-generation offspring because his large sample size overcame the influence of variability resulting from chance. In
contrast, no human couple has ever had thousands of children. If we know that a man and woman are both heterozygous for
a recessive genetic disorder, we would predict that one in every four of their children would be affected by the disease.
