Recall that filtration occurs as pressure forces fluid and solutes through a semipermeable barrier with the
solute movement constrained by particle size. Hydrostatic pressure is the pressure produced by a fluid against a surface. If
you have a fluid on both sides of a barrier, both fluids exert a pressure in opposing directions. Net fluid movement will be in
the direction of the lower pressure. Osmosis is the movement of solvent (water) across a membrane that is impermeable to
a solute in the solution. This creates a pressure, osmotic pressure, which will exist until the solute concentration is the same
on both sides of a semipermeable membrane. As long as the concentration differs, water will move. Glomerular filtration
occurs when glomerular hydrostatic pressure exceeds the luminal hydrostatic pressure of Bowmanâ€™s capsule. There is also
an opposing force, the osmotic pressure, which is typically higher in the glomerular capillary.

To understand why this is so, look more closely at the microenvironment on either side of the filtration membrane.
