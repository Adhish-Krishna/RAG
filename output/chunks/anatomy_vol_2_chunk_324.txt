The
middle ear contains the ossicles and is connected to the pharynx by the Eustachian tube. The inner ear contains the
cochlea and vestibule, which are responsible for audition and equilibrium, respectively.

 The inner ear is often described as a bony labyrinth, as it is composed of a series of canals embedded within the
temporal bone. It has two separate regions, the cochlea and the vestibule, which are responsible for hearing and balance,
respectively. The neural signals from these two regions are relayed to the brain stem through separate fiber bundles.
 However, these two distinct bundles travel together from the inner ear to the brain stem as the vestibulocochlear nerve.
 Sound is transduced into neural signals within the cochlear region of the inner ear, which contains the sensory neurons of
the spiral ganglia. These ganglia are located within the spiral-shaped cochlea of the inner ear. The cochlea is attached to
the stapes through the oval window.

 The oval window is located at the beginning of a fluid-filled tube within the cochlea called the scala vestibuli.
