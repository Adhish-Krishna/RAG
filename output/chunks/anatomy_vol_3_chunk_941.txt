Melanin comes in different shades of brown and black.
 Individuals with darker skin have darker, more abundant melanin, whereas fair-skinned individuals have a lighter shade of skin and
less melanin. Exposure to UV irradiation stimulates the melanocytes to produce and secrete more melanin. 26 As the cells move
into the stratum spinosum, they begin the synthesis of keratin and extend cell processes, desmosomes, which link the cells. As the
stratum basale continues to produce new cells, the keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum are pushed into the stratum granulosum.
 The cells become flatter, their cell membranes thicken, and they generate large amounts of the proteins keratin and keratohyalin.
 The nuclei and other cell organelles disintegrate as the cells die, leaving behind the keratin, keratohyalin, and cell membranes that
form the stratum lucidum and the stratum corneum. The keratinocytes in these layers are mostly dead and flattened. Cells in the
stratum corneum are periodically shed. 27 Eccrine sweat glands are all over the body, especially the forehead and palms of the
hand.
