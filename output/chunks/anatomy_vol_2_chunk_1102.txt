The second heart sound, S2 or dub, occurs when the semilunar valves close. When the
pressure falls below that of the atria, blood moves from the atria into the ventricles, opening the atrioventricular valves and
marking one complete heart cycle. The valves prevent backflow of blood. Failure of the valves to operate properly produces
turbulent blood flow within the heart; the resulting heart murmur can often be heard with a stethoscope.

 19.4 Cardiac Physiology

Many factors affect HR and SV, and together, they contribute to cardiac function. HR is largely determined and regulated
by autonomic stimulation and hormones. There are several feedback loops that contribute to maintaining homeostasis
dependent upon activity levels, such as the atrial reflex, which is determined by venous return.

SV is regulated by autonomic innervation and hormones, but also by filling time and venous return. Venous return
is determined by activity of the skeletal muscles, blood volume, and changes in peripheral circulation.
