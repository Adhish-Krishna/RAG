Thin filaments, anchored at their ends by the Z-discs, do not extend completely into the central region
that only contains thick filaments, anchored at their bases at a spot called the M-line. A myofibril is composed of many
sarcomeres running along its length; thus, myofibrils and muscle cells contract as the sarcomeres contract.

CHAPTER 10| MUSCLE TISSUE 387

The Sliding Filament Model of Contraction

When signaled by a motor neuron, a skeletal muscle fiber contracts as the thin filaments are pulled and then slide past the
thick filaments within the fiber’s sarcomeres. This process is known as the sliding filament model of muscle contraction
(Figure 10.10). The sliding can only occur when myosin-binding sites on the actin filaments are exposed by a series of

steps that begins with Ca*” entry into the sarcoplasm.
