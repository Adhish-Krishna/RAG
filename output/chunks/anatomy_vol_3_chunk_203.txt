The Pharynx

The pharynx (throat) is involved in both digestion and respiration. It receives food and air from the mouth, and air from the
nasal cavities. When food enters the pharynx, involuntary muscle contractions close off the air passageways.

 A short tube of skeletal muscle lined with a mucous membrane, the pharynx runs from the posterior oral and nasal
cavities to the opening of the esophagus and larynx. It has three subdivisions. The most superior, the nasopharynx, is
involved only in breathing and speech. The other two subdivisions, the oropharynx and the laryngopharynx, are used
for both breathing and digestion. The oropharynx begins inferior to the nasopharynx and is continuous below with the
laryngopharynx (Figure 23.12).
