 Coronary Circulation

You will recall that the heart is a remarkable pump composed largely of cardiac muscle cells that are incredibly active
throughout life. Like all other cells, a cardiomyocyte requires a reliable supply of oxygen and nutrients, and a way to
remove wastes, so it needs a dedicated, complex, and extensive coronary circulation. And because of the critical and nearly
ceaseless activity of the heart throughout life, this need for a blood supply is even greater than for a typical cell. However,
coronary circulation is not continuous; rather, it cycles, reaching a peak when the heart muscle is relaxed and nearly ceasing
while it is contracting.

 Coronary Arteries

Coronary arteries supply blood to the myocardium and other components of the heart. The first portion of the aorta after
it arises from the left ventricle gives rise to the coronary arteries.
