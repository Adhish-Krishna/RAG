The placenta provides the fetus with necessary oxygen and nutrients via the umbilical vein. (Remember that veins carry
blood toward the heart. In this case, the blood flowing to the fetal heart is oxygenated because it comes from the placenta.
 The respiratory system is immature and cannot yet oxygenate blood on its own.) From the umbilical vein, the oxygenated
blood flows toward the inferior vena cava, all but bypassing the immature liver, via the ductus venosus shunt (Figure
28.17). The liver receives just a trickle of blood, which is all that it needs in its immature, semifunctional state. Blood flows
from the inferior vena cava to the right atrium, mixing with fetal venous blood along the way.

 Although the fetal liver is semifunctional, the fetal lungs are nonfunctional. The fetal circulation therefore bypasses
the lungs by shifting some of the blood through the foramen ovale, a shunt that directly connects the right and left atria
and avoids the pulmonary trunk altogether.
