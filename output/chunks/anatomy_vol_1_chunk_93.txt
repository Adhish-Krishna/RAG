The parietal layers of the membranes line the walls of the body cavity (pariet- refers to a
cavity wall). The visceral layer of the membrane covers the organs (the viscera). Between the parietal and visceral layers is
a very thin, fluid-filled serous space, or cavity (Figure 1.17).

Figure 1.17 Serous Membrane Serous membrane lines the pericardial cavity and reflects back to cover the
heartâ€”much the same way that an underinflated balloon would form two layers surrounding a fist.

 There are three serous cavities and their associated membranes. The pleura is the serous membrane that surrounds
the lungs in the pleural cavity; the pericardium is the serous membrane that surrounds the heart in the pericardial cavity;
and the peritoneum is the serous membrane that surrounds several organs in the abdominopelvic cavity.
