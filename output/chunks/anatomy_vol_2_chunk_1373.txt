There are two chains in the T cell receptor, and each chain consists of two domains. The variable region domain
is furthest away from the T cell membrane and is so named because its amino acid sequence varies between receptors.
 In contrast, the constant region domain has less variation. The differences in the amino acid sequences of the variable
domains are the molecular basis of the diversity of antigens the receptor can recognize. Thus, the antigen-binding site of the
receptor consists of the terminal ends of both receptor chains, and the amino acid sequences of those two areas combine to
determine its antigenic specificity. Each T cell produces only one type of receptor and thus is specific for a single particular
antigen.

 Antigens

Antigens on pathogens are usually large and complex, and consist of many antigenic determinants. An antigenic
determinant (epitope) is one of the small regions within an antigen to which a receptor can bind, and antigenic determinants
are limited by the size of the receptor itself.
