At the NMJ, the axon terminal releases a chemical messenger, or
neurotransmitter, called acetylcholine (ACh). The ACh molecules diffuse across a minute space called the synaptic cleft
and bind to ACh receptors located within the motor end-plate of the sarcolemma on the other side of the synapse. Once
ACh binds, a channel in the ACh receptor opens and positively charged ions can pass through into the muscle fiber, causing
it to depolarize, meaning that the membrane potential of the muscle fiber becomes less negative (closer to zero.)

 As the membrane depolarizes, another set of ion channels called voltage-gated sodium channels are triggered to open.
 Sodium ions enter the muscle fiber, and an action potential rapidly spreads (or “fires”) along the entire membrane to initiate
excitation-contraction coupling.

 Things happen very quickly in the world of excitable membranes (just think about how quickly you can snap your
fingers as soon as you decide to do it).
