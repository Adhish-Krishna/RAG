Most of the rest of the blood is pumped to the right ventricle, and from there,
into the pulmonary trunk, which splits into pulmonary arteries. However, a shunt within the pulmonary artery, the ductus
arteriosus, diverts a portion of this blood into the aorta. This ensures that only a small volume of oxygenated blood passes
through the immature pulmonary circuit, which has only minor metabolic requirements. Blood vessels of uninflated lungs
have high resistance to flow, a condition that encourages blood to flow to the aorta, which presents much lower resistance.
 The oxygenated blood moves through the foramen ovale into the left atrium, where it mixes with the now deoxygenated
blood returning from the pulmonary circuit. This blood then moves into the left ventricle, where it is pumped into the aorta.
 Some of this blood moves through the coronary arteries into the myocardium, and some moves through the carotid arteries
to the brain.
