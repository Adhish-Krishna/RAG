Proper

Fibroblasts are present in all connective tissue proper (Figure 4.12). Fibrocytes, adipocytes, and mesenchymal cells are
fixed cells, which means they remain within the connective tissue. Other cells move in and out of the connective tissue
in response to chemical signals. Macrophages, mast cells, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and phagocytic cells are found in
connective tissue proper but are actually part of the immune system protecting the body.

Cell Types

The most abundant cell in connective tissue proper is the fibroblast. Polysaccharides and proteins secreted by fibroblasts
combine with extra-cellular fluids to produce a viscous ground substance that, with embedded fibrous proteins, forms the
extra-cellular matrix.
