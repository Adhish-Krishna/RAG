Figure 5.8 Skin Pigmentation The relative coloration of the skin depends of the amount of melanin produced by
melanocytes in the stratum basale and taken up by keratinocytes.

 Melanin occurs in two primary forms. Eumelanin exists as black and brown, whereas pheomelanin provides a red
color. Dark-skinned individuals produce more melanin than those with pale skin. Exposure to the UV rays of the sun or a
tanning salon causes melanin to be manufactured and built up in keratinocytes, as sun exposure stimulates keratinocytes
to secrete chemicals that stimulate melanocytes. The accumulation of melanin in keratinocytes results in the darkening of
the skin, or a tan. This increased melanin accumulation protects the DNA of epidermal cells from UV ray damage and the
breakdown of folic acid, a nutrient necessary for our health and well-being.
