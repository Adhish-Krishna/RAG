Because the heaviest
elements in blood are the erythrocytes, these settle at the very bottom of the hematocrit tube. Located above the erythrocytes
is a pale, thin layer composed of the remaining formed elements of blood. These are the WBCs, clinically known as
leukocytes, and the platelets, cell fragments also called thrombocytes. This layer is referred to as the buffy coat because of
its color; it normally constitutes less than 1 percent of a blood sample. Above the buffy coat is the blood plasma, normally
a pale, straw-colored fluid, which constitutes the remainder of the sample.

 The volume of erythrocytes after centrifugation is also commonly referred to as packed cell volume (PCV). In normal
blood, about 45 percent of a sample is erythrocytes. The hematocrit of any one sample can vary significantly, however,
about 36-50 percent, according to gender and other factors.
