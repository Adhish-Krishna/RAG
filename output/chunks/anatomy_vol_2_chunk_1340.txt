Any bacteria that infect the interstitial fluid are taken up by the lymphatic capillaries and
transported to a regional lymph node. Dendritic cells and macrophages within this organ internalize and kill many of the
pathogens that pass through, thereby removing them from the body. The lymph node is also the site of adaptive immune
responses mediated by T cells, B cells, and accessory cells of the adaptive immune system. Like the thymus, the bean-
shaped lymph nodes are surrounded by a tough capsule of connective tissue and are separated into compartments by
trabeculae, the extensions of the capsule. In addition to the structure provided by the capsule and trabeculae, the structura
support of the lymph node is provided by a series of reticular fibers laid down by fibroblasts.
