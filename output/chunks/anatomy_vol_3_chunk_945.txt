Additionally, the
yellow marrow, which is found in the central cavity of long bones along with red marrow, serves as a storage site for fat. 41
Structurally, a tarsal is a short bone, meaning its length, width, and thickness are about equal, while a metatarsal is a long bone
whose length is greater than its width. Functionally, the tarsal provides limited motion, while the metatarsal acts as a lever. 42
Structurally, the femur is a long bone, meaning its length is greater than its width, while the patella, a sesamoid bone, is small
and round. Functionally, the femur acts as a lever, while the patella protects the patellar tendon from compressive forces. 43 If
the articular cartilage at the end of one of your long bones were to deteriorate, which is actually what happens in osteoarthritis,
you would experience joint pain at the end of that bone and limitation of motion at that joint because there would be no cartilage
to reduce friction between adjacent bones and there would be no cartilage to act as a shock absorber.
