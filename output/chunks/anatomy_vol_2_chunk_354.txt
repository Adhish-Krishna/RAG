The cone-shaped outer segments of the
cone photoreceptor contain their photosensitive pigments in infoldings of the cell membrane. There are three cone
photopigments, called opsins, which are each sensitive to a particular wavelength of light. The wavelength of visible light

determines its color. The pigments in human eyes are specialized in perceiving three different primary colors: red, green,
and blue.
