The large opening
between the vertebral arch and body is the vertebral foramen, which contains the spinal cord. In the intact vertebral
column, the vertebral foramina of all of the vertebrae align to form the vertebral (spinal) canal, which serves as the bony
protection and passageway for the spinal cord down the back. When the vertebrae are aligned together in the vertebral
column, notches in the margins of the pedicles of adjacent vertebrae together form an intervertebral foramen, the opening
through which a spinal nerve exits from the vertebral column (Figure 7.24).
 Seven processes arise from the vertebral arch. Each paired transverse process projects laterally and arises from the
junction point between the pedicle and lamina. The single spinous process (vertebral spine) projects posteriorly at the
midline of the back. The vertebral spines can easily be felt as a series of bumps just under the skin down the middle of
the back.
