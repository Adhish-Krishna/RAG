much larger external iliac artery supplies blood to each of the lower limbs. Figure 20.29 shows the distribution of the
major branches of the aorta into the thoracic and abdominal regions. Figure 20.30 shows the distribution of the major
branches of the common iliac arteries. Table 20.8 summarizes the major branches of the abdominal aorta.
