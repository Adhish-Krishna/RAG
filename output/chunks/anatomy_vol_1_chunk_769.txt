The suprascapular notch is located lateral to the midpoint of the superior border. The corners
of the triangular scapula, at either end of the medial border, are the superior angle of the scapula, located between the
medial and superior borders, and the inferior angle of the scapula, located between the medial and lateral borders. The
inferior angle is the most inferior portion of the scapula, and is particularly important because it serves as the attachment
point for several powerful muscles involved in shoulder and upper limb movements. The remaining corner of the scapula,
between the superior and lateral borders, is the location of the glenoid cavity (glenoid fossa). This shallow depression
articulates with the humerus bone of the arm to form the glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint). The small bony bumps
located immediately above and below the glenoid cavity are the supraglenoid tubercle and the infraglenoid tubercle,
respectively. These provide attachments for muscles of the arm.
