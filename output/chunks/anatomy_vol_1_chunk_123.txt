The elements in the human body are
shown in Figure 2.2, beginning with the most abundant: oxygen (O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N). Each
element’s name can be replaced by a one- or two-letter symbol; you will become familiar with some of these during this
course. All the elements in your body are derived from the foods you eat and the air you breathe.
