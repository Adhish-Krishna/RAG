Plasma osmolality is thus the ratio of
solutes to water in blood plasma. A person’s plasma osmolality value reflects his or her state of hydration. A healthy body
maintains plasma osmolality within a narrow range, by employing several mechanisms that regulate both water intake and
output.

 Drinking water is considered voluntary. So how is water intake regulated by the body? Consider someone who is
experiencing dehydration, a net loss of water that results in insufficient water in blood and other tissues. The water that
leaves the body, as exhaled air, sweat, or urine, is ultimately extracted from blood plasma. As the blood becomes more
concentrated, the thirst response—a sequence of physiological processes—is triggered (Figure 26.10). Osmoreceptors are
sensory receptors in the thirst center in the hypothalamus that monitor the concentration of solutes (osmolality) of the blood.
 If blood osmolality increases above its ideal value, the hypothalamus transmits signals that result in a conscious awareness
of thirst.
