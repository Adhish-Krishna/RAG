In
contrast, at joints that allow for wide ranges of motion, the articulating surfaces of the bones are not directly united to
each other. Instead, these surfaces are enclosed within a space filled with lubricating fluid, which allows the bones to move
smoothly against each other. These joints provide greater mobility, but since the bones are free to move in relation to each
other, the joint is less stable. Most of the joints between the bones of the appendicular skeleton are this freely moveable type
of joint. These joints allow the muscles of the body to pull on a bone and thereby produce movement of that body region.
 Your ability to kick a soccer ball, pick up a fork, and dance the tango depend on mobility at these types of joints.

9.1 | Classification of Joints

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Distinguish between the functional and structural classifications for joints
¢ Describe the three functional types of joints and give an example of each
¢ List the three types of diarthrodial joints

A joint, also called an articulation, is any place where adjacent bones or bone and cartilage come together (articulate
with each other) to form a connection.
