21 Unlike somatic cells, sperm are haploid. They also have very little cytoplasm. They have a head with a compact
nucleus covered by an acrosome filled with enzymes, and a mid-piece filled with mitochondria that power their movement. They
are motile because of their tail, a structure containing a flagellum, which is specialized for movement. 22 The three accessory
glands make the following contributions to semen: the seminal vesicle contributes about 60 percent of the semen volume, with
fluid that contains large amounts of fructose to power the movement of sperm; the prostate gland contributes substances critical
to sperm maturation; and the bulbourethral glands contribute a thick fluid that lubricates the ends of the urethra and the vagina
and helps to clean urine residues from the urethra.
