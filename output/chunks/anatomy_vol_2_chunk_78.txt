Axon diameters can be
as small as 1 to 20 micrometers. Because a micrometer is 1/1000 of a millimeter, this means that the length of a myelin
sheath can be 100-1000 times the diameter of the axon. Figure 12.8, Figure 12.11, and Figure 12.12 show the myelin
sheath surrounding an axon segment, but are not to scale. If the myelin sheath were drawn to scale, the neuron would have
to be immenseâ€”possibly covering an entire wall of the room in which you are sitting.
