With the exception of the unipolar sensory ganglion cells, and the two specific bipolar cells
mentioned above, all other neurons are multipolar. Some cutting edge research suggests that certain neurons in the CNS
do not conform to the standard model of “one, and only one” axon. Some sources describe a fourth type of neuron, called
an anaxonic neuron. The name suggests that it has no axon (an- = “without”), but this is not accurate. Anaxonic neurons
are very small, and if you look through a microscope at the standard resolution used in histology (approximately 400X to
1000X total magnification), you will not be able to distinguish any process specifically as an axon or a dendrite. Any of
those processes can function as an axon depending on the conditions at any given time. Nevertheless, even if they cannot
be easily seen, and one specific process is definitively the axon, these neurons have multiple processes and are therefore
multipolar.
