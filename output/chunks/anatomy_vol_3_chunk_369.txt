Because one triglyceride molecule yields three fatty acid molecules with as
much as 16 or more carbons in each one, fat molecules yield more energy than carbohydrates and are an important source of
energy for the human body. Triglycerides yield more than twice the energy per unit mass when compared to carbohydrates
and proteins. Therefore, when glucose levels are low, triglycerides can be converted into acetyl CoA molecules and used to
generate ATP through aerobic respiration.

 The breakdown of fatty acids, called fatty acid oxidation or beta (B)-oxidation, begins in the cytoplasm, where
fatty acids are converted into fatty acyl CoA molecules. This fatty acyl CoA combines with carnitine to create a fatty
acyl carnitine molecule, which helps to transport the fatty acid across the mitochondrial membrane. Once inside the
mitochondrial matrix, the fatty acyl carnitine molecule is converted back into fatty acyl CoA and then into acetyl CoA
(Figure 24.13).
