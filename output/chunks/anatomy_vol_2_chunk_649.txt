There is an obvious connection to motor function based on the clinical
implications of cerebellar damage. There is also strong evidence of the cerebellar role in procedural memory. The two are
not incompatible; in fact, procedural memory is motor memory, such as learning to ride a bicycle. Significant work has been
performed to describe the connections within the cerebellum that result in learning. A model for this learning is classical
conditioning, as shown by the famous dogs from the physiologist Ivan Pavlovâ€™s work. This classical conditioning, which
can be related to motor learning, fits with the neural connections of the cerebellum. The cerebellum is 10 percent of the
mass of the brain and has varied functions that all point to a role in the motor system.

Location and Connections of the Cerebellum

The cerebellum is located in apposition to the dorsal surface of the brain stem, centered on the pons.
