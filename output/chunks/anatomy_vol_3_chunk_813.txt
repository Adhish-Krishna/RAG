Figure 28.14 Embryonic Folding Embryonic folding converts a flat sheet of cells into a hollow, tube-like structure.

 Within the first 8 weeks of gestation, a developing embryo establishes the rudimentary structures of all of its organs
and tissues from the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. This process is called organogenesis.

 Like the central nervous system, the heart also begins its development in the embryo as a tube-like structure, connected
via capillaries to the chorionic villi. Cells of the primitive tube-shaped heart are capable of electrical conduction and
contraction. The heart begins beating in the beginning of the fourth week, although it does not actually pump embryonic
blood until a week later, when the oversized liver has begun producing red blood cells.
