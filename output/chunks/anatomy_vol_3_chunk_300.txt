During absorption, co-
transport mechanisms result in the accumulation of sodium ions inside the cells, whereas anti-port mechanisms reduce the
potassium ion concentration inside the cells. To restore the sodium-potassium gradient across the cell membrane, a sodium-
potassium pump requiring ATP pumps sodium out and potassium in.
 In general, all minerals that enter the intestine are absorbed, whether you need them or not. Iron and calcium are
exceptions; they are absorbed in the duodenum in amounts that meet the body’s current requirements, as follows:
Iron—The ionic iron needed for the production of hemoglobin is absorbed into mucosal cells via active transport.
 Once inside mucosal cells, ionic iron binds to the protein ferritin, creating iron-ferritin complexes that store iron until
needed. When the body has enough iron, most of the stored iron is lost when worn-out epithelial cells slough off. When
the body needs iron because, for example, it is lost during acute or chronic bleeding, there is increased uptake of iron
from the intestine and accelerated release of iron into the bloodstream.
