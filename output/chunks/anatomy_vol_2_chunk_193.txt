The lateral sulcus
that separates the temporal lobe from the other regions is one such landmark. Superior to the lateral sulcus are the parietal
lobe and frontal lobe, which are separated from each other by the central sulcus. The posterior region of the cortex is the
occipital lobe, which has no obvious anatomical border between it and the parietal or temporal lobes on the lateral surface
of the brain. From the medial surface, an obvious landmark separating the parietal and occipital lobes is called the parieto-
occipital sulcus. The fact that there is no obvious anatomical border between these lobes is consistent with the functions of
these regions being interrelated.
