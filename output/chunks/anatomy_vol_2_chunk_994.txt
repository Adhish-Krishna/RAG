Nearly all of these
positions require an associate degree, and these technicians earn a median salary of $49,410 as of May 2010, according
to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Growth within the field is fast, projected at 29 percent from 2010 to 2020.

 There is a considerable overlap and complementary skills between cardiac technicians and vascular technicians,
and so the term cardiovascular technician is often used. Special certifications within the field require documenting
appropriate experience and completing additional and often expensive certification examinations. These subspecialties
include Certified Rhythm Analysis Technician (CRAT), Certified Cardiographic Technician (CCT), Registered
Congenital Cardiac Sonographer (RCCS), Registered Cardiac Electrophysiology Specialist (RCES), Registered
Cardiovascular Invasive Specialist (RCIS), Registered Cardiac Sonographer (RCS), Registered Vascular Specialist
(RVS), and Registered Phlebology Sonographer (RPhS).
