Figure 25.13 Juxtaglomerular Apparatus and Glomerulus (a) The JGA allows specialized cells to monitor the
composition of the fluid in the DCT and adjust the glomerular filtration rate. (b) This micrograph shows the glomerulus
and surrounding structures. LM x 1540. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School

A second cell type in this apparatus is the juxtaglomerular cell. This is a modified, smooth muscle cell lining the
afferent arteriole that can contract or relax in response to ATP or adenosine released by the macula densa. Such contraction
and relaxation regulate blood flow to the glomerulus. If the osmolarity of the filtrate is too high (hyperosmotic), the
juxtaglomerular cells will contract, decreasing the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) so less plasma is filtered, leading to less
urine formation and greater retention of fluid.
