Figure 13.3 Primary and Secondary Vesicle Stages of Development The embryonic brain develops complexity
through enlargements of the neural tube called vesicles; (a) The primary vesicle stage has three regions, and (b) the
secondary vesicle stage has five regions.

Watch this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/braindevel) to examine the development of the brain, starting
with the neural tube. As the anterior end of the neural tube develops, it enlarges into the primary vesicles that
establish the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. Those structures continue to develop throughout the rest of embryonic
development and into adolescence. They are the basis of the structure of the fully developed adult brain. How would
you describe the difference in the relative sizes of the three regions of the brain when comparing the early (25th
embryonic day) brain and the adult brain?

Spinal Cord Development

While the brain is developing from the anterior neural tube, the spinal cord is developing from the posterior neural tube.
