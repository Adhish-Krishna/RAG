This seems to be the major function of tonsils—to help children’s bodies recognize, destroy, and
develop immunity to common environmental pathogens so that they will be protected in their later lives. Tonsils are often
removed in those children who have recurring throat infections, especially those involving the palatine tonsils on either side
of the throat, whose swelling may interfere with their breathing and/or swallowing.
