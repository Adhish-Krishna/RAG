To understand how neurons are able to communicate, it is necessary to describe the role
of an excitable membrane in generating these signals. The basis of this communication is the action potential, which
demonstrates how changes in the membrane can constitute a signal. Looking at the way these signals work in more variable
circumstances involves a look at graded potentials, which will be covered in the next section.

 Electrically Active Cell Membranes

Most cells in the body make use of charged particles, ions, to build up a charge across the cell membrane. Previously,
this was shown to be a part of how muscle cells work. For skeletal muscles to contract, based on excitationâ€”contraction
coupling, requires input from a neuron. Both of the cells make use of the cell membrane to regulate ion movement between
the extracellular fluid and cytosol.

 As you learned in the chapter on cells, the cell membrane is primarily responsible for regulating what can cross the
membrane and what stays on only one side.
