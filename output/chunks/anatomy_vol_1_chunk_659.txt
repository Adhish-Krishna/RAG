It unites the right and left parietal bones. On the posterior skull, the
sagittal suture terminates by joining the lambdoid suture. The lambdoid suture extends downward and laterally to either
side away from its junction with the sagittal suture. The lambdoid suture joins the occipital bone to the right and left parietal
and temporal bones. This suture is named for its upside-down "V" shape, which resembles the capital letter version of the
Greek letter lambda (A). The squamous suture is located on the lateral skull. It unites the squamous portion of the temporal
bone with the parietal bone (see Figure 7.5). At the intersection of four bones is the pterion, a small, capital-H-shaped
suture line region that unites the frontal bone, parietal bone, squamous portion of the temporal bone, and greater wing of
the sphenoid bone.
