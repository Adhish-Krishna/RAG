A famous case of damage to the prefrontal cortex
is that of Phineas Gage, dating back to 1848. He was a railroad worker who had a metal spike impale his prefrontal
cortex (Figure 14.27). He survived the accident, but according to second-hand accounts, his personality changed drastically.
 Friends described him as no longer acting like himself. Whereas he was a hardworking, amiable man before the accident,
he turned into an irritable, temperamental, and lazy man after the accident. Many of the accounts of his change may have
been inflated in the retelling, and some behavior was likely attributable to alcohol used as a pain medication. However, the
accounts suggest that some aspects of his personality did change. Also, there is new evidence that though his life changed
dramatically, he was able to become a functioning stagecoach driver, suggesting that the brain has the ability to recover
even from major trauma such as this.
