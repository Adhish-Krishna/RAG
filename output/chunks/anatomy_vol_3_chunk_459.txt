When bladder volume reaches about 150 mL, an urge
to void is sensed but is easily overridden. Voluntary control of urination relies on consciously preventing relaxation of the
external urethral sphincter to maintain urinary continence. As the bladder fills, subsequent urges become harder to ignore.
 Ultimately, voluntary constraint fails with resulting incontinence, which will occur as bladder volume approaches 300 to
400 mL.

Normal micturition is a result of stretch receptors in the bladder wall that transmit nerve impulses to the sacral region of
the spinal cord to generate a spinal reflex. The resulting parasympathetic neural outflow causes contraction of the detrusor
muscle and relaxation of the involuntary internal urethral sphincter. At the same time, the spinal cord inhibits somatic motor
neurons, resulting in the relaxation of the skeletal muscle of the external urethral sphincter. The micturition reflex is active
in infants but with maturity, children learn to override the reflex by asserting external sphincter control, thereby delaying
voiding (potty training).
