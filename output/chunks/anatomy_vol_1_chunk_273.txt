In the beaker on
the left, the solution on the right side of the membrane is hypertonic.

 The movement of water molecules is not itself regulated by cells, so it is important that cells are exposed to an
environment in which the concentration of solutes outside of the cells (in the extracellular fluid) is equal to the concentration

of solutes inside the cells (in the cytoplasm). Two solutions that have the same concentration of solutes are said to be
isotonic (equal tension). When cells and their extracellular environments are isotonic, the concentration of water molecules
is the same outside and inside the cells, and the cells maintain their normal shape (and function).

 Osmosis occurs when there is an imbalance of solutes outside of a cell versus inside the cell. A solution that has a
higher concentration of solutes than another solution is said to be hypertonic, and water molecules tend to diffuse into a
hypertonic solution (Figure 3.8).
