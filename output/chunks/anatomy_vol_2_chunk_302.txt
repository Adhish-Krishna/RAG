Transmembrane receptors are activated by chemicals called ligands. For example, a molecule
in food can serve as a ligand for taste receptors. Other transmembrane proteins, which are not accurately called receptors,
are sensitive to mechanical or thermal changes. Physical changes in these proteins increase ion flow across the membrane,
and can generate an action potential or a graded potential in the sensory neurons.

 Sensory Receptors

Stimuli in the environment activate specialized receptor cells in the peripheral nervous system. Different types of stimuli
are sensed by different types of receptor cells. Receptor cells can be classified into types on the basis of three different
criteria: cell type, position, and function. Receptors can be classified structurally on the basis of cell type and their position
in relation to stimuli they sense. They can also be classified functionally on the basis of the transduction of stimuli, or how
the mechanical stimulus, light, or chemical changed the cell membrane potential.
