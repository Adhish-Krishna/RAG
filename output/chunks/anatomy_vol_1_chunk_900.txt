Finally, an articular disc can serve to smooth the
movements between the articulating bones, as seen at the temporomandibular joint. Some synovial joints also have a fat
pad, which can serve as a cushion between the bones.

 Additional structures located outside of a synovial joint serve to prevent friction between the bones of the joint and
the overlying muscle tendons or skin. A bursa (plural = bursae) is a thin connective tissue sac filled with lubricating
liquid. They are located in regions where skin, ligaments, muscles, or muscle tendons can rub against each other, usually
near a body joint (Figure 9.9). Bursae reduce friction by separating the adjacent structures, preventing them from rubbing
directly against each other. Bursae are classified by their location. A subcutaneous bursa is located between the skin and
an underlying bone. It allows skin to move smoothly over the bone. Examples include the prepatellar bursa located over the
kneecap and the olecranon bursa at the tip of the elbow.
