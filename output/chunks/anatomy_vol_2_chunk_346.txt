The extraocular muscles are innervated by three cranial nerves. The lateral rectus, which causes abduction of the eye,
is innervated by the abducens nerve. The superior oblique is innervated by the trochlear nerve. All of the other muscles are
innervated by the oculomotor nerve, as is the levator palpebrae superioris. The motor nuclei of these cranial nerves connect
to the brain stem, which coordinates eye movements.
