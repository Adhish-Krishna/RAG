The tendons of the forearm muscles attach to the wrist and extend into the hand. Fibrous bands called retinacula
sheath the tendons at the wrist. The flexor retinaculum extends over the palmar surface of the hand while the extensor

retinaculum extends over the dorsal surface of the hand.

 Intrinsic Muscles of the Hand

The intrinsic muscles of the hand both originate and insert within it (Figure 11.28). These muscles allow your fingers
to also make precise movements for actions, such as typing or writing. These muscles are divided into three groups. The
thenar muscles are on the radial aspect of the palm. The hypothenar muscles are on the medial aspect of the palm, and the

intermediate muscles are midpalmar.
