The liver now
secretes bile. The fetus circulates amniotic fluid by swallowing it and producing urine. The eyes are well-developed by this
stage, but the eyelids are fused shut. The fingers and toes begin to develop nails. By the end of week 12, the fetus measures
approximately 9 cm (3.5 in) from crown to rump.

 Weeks 13-16 are marked by sensory organ development. The eyes move closer together; blinking motions begin,
although the eyes remain sealed shut. The lips exhibit sucking motions. The ears move upward and lie flatter against the
head. The scalp begins to grow hair. The excretory system is also developing: the kidneys are well-formed, and meconium,
or fetal feces, begins to accumulate in the intestines. Meconium consists of ingested amniotic fluid, cellular debris, mucus,
and bile.

 During approximately weeks 16-20, as the fetus grows and limb movements become more powerful, the mother may
begin to feel quickening, or fetal movements.
