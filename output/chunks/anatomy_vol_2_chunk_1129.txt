Rather, there is a gradual transition as the vascular tree
repeatedly branches. In turn, muscular arteries branch to distribute blood to the vast network of arterioles. For this reason, a
muscular artery is also known as a distributing artery.

 Arterioles

An arteriole is a very small artery that leads to a capillary. Arterioles have the same three tunics as the larger vessels, but
the thickness of each is greatly diminished. The critical endothelial lining of the tunica intima is intact. The tunica media
is restricted to one or two smooth muscle cell layers in thickness. The tunica externa remains but is very thin (see Figure
20.4).

 With a lumen averaging 30 micrometers or less in diameter, arterioles are critical in slowing down—or
resisting—blood flow and, thus, causing a substantial drop in blood pressure. Because of this, you may see them referred
to as resistance vessels. The muscle fibers in arterioles are normally slightly contracted, causing arterioles to maintain a
consistent muscle tone—in this case referred to as vascular tone—in a similar manner to the muscular tone of skeletal
muscle.
