Its short length, about 4 cm, is less of a barrier to fecal bacteria than the longer
male urethra and the best explanation for the greater incidence of UTI in women. Voluntary control of the external urethral
sphincter is a function of the pudendal nerve. It arises in the sacral region of the spinal cord, traveling via the S2-S4 nerves
of the sacral plexus.

 Male Urethra

The male urethra passes through the prostate gland immediately inferior to the bladder before passing below the pubic
symphysis (see Figure 25.3b). The length of the male urethra varies between men but averages 20 cm in length. It is
divided into four regions: the preprostatic urethra, the prostatic urethra, the membranous urethra, and the spongy or penile
urethra. The preprostatic urethra is very short and incorporated into the bladder wall. The prostatic urethra passes through
the prostate gland. During sexual intercourse, it receives sperm via the ejaculatory ducts and secretions from the seminal
vesicles.
