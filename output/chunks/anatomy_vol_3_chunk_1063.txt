23 During sexual arousal, nitric oxide (NO) is released from nerve endings
near blood vessels within the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum. The release of NO activates a signaling pathway that
results in relaxation of the smooth muscles that surround the penile arteries, causing them to dilate. This dilation increases the
amount of blood that can enter the penis, and induces the endothelial cells in the penile arterial walls to secrete NO, perpetuating
the vasodilation. The rapid increase in blood volume fills the erectile chambers, and the increased pressure of the filled chambers
compresses the thin-walled penile venules, preventing venous drainage of the penis. An erection is the result of this increased blood
flow to the penis and reduced blood return from the penis. 24 Testosterone production by the body would be reduced if a male
were taking anabolic steroids. This is because the hypothalamus responds to rising testosterone levels by reducing its secretion
of GnRH, which would in turn reduce the anterior pituitaryâ€™s release of LH, finally reducing the manufacture of testosterone in
the testes.
