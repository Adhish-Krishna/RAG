This is what
is meant by immunity to a disease. The same pattern of primary and secondary immune responses occurs in B cells and the
antibody response, as will be discussed later in the chapter.

 T Cell Types and their Functions

In the discussion of T cell development, you saw that mature T cells express either the CD4 marker or the CD8 marker,
but not both. These markers are cell adhesion molecules that keep the T cell in close contact with the antigen-presenting
cell by directly binding to the MHC molecule (to a different part of the molecule than does the antigen). Thus, T cells and
antigen-presenting cells are held together in two ways: by CD4 or CD8 attaching to MHC and by the T cell receptor binding
to antigen (Figure 21.20).

Cytotoxic T cells destroy infected cells by releasing enzymes
that rupture cell membranes
