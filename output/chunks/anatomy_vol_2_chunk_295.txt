Damage to specific regions of the cerebral cortex, such
as through a stroke, can result in specific losses of function.
 What functions would likely be lost by a stroke in the
temporal lobe?

36. Why do the anatomical inputs to the cerebellum suggest
that it can compare motor commands and sensory feedback?

CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
37. Why can the circle of Willis maintain perfusion of the
brain even if there is a blockage in one part of the structure?

38. Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges that
can have severe effects on neurological function. Why is
infection of this structure potentially so dangerous?

39. Why are ganglia and nerves not surrounded by
protective structures like the meninges of the CNS?

40. Testing for neurological function involves a series of
tests of functions associated with the cranial nerves. What
functions, and therefore which nerves, are being tested by
asking a patient to follow the tip of a pen with their eyes?
