The basal lamina attaches to a reticular lamina, which is secreted by the underlying connective tissue,
forming a basement membrane that helps hold it all together.

 Epithelial tissues are nearly completely avascular. For instance, no blood vessels cross the basement membrane to
enter the tissue, and nutrients must come by diffusion or absorption from underlying tissues or the surface. Many epithelial
tissues are capable of rapidly replacing damaged and dead cells. Sloughing off of damaged or dead cells is a characteristic
of surface epithelium and allows our airways and digestive tracts to rapidly replace damaged cells with new cells.

 Generalized Functions of Epithelial Tissue

Epithelial tissues provide the bodyâ€™s first line of protection from physical, chemical, and biological wear and tear. The cells
of an epithelium act as gatekeepers of the body controlling permeability and allowing selective transfer of materials across a
physical barrier. All substances that enter the body must cross an epithelium. Some epithelia often include structural features
that allow the selective transport of molecules and ions across their cell membranes.
