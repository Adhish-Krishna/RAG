There are genetic factors in autoimmune diseases as well. Some diseases are associated with the MHC genes that
an individual expresses. The reason for this association is likely because if oneâ€™s MHC molecules are not able to present
a certain self-antigen, then that particular autoimmune disease cannot occur. Overall, there are more than 80 different
autoimmune diseases, which are a significant health problem in the elderly. Table 21.7 lists several of the most common
autoimmune diseases, the antigens that are targeted, and the segment of the adaptive immune response that causes the
damage.
