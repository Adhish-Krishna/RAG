The reverse is true of tissues, such
as adipose (body fat), which have lower metabolic rates. Because less oxygen is used by these cells, the partial pressure
of oxygen within such tissues remains relatively high, resulting in fewer oxygen molecules dissociating from hemoglobin
and entering the tissue interstitial fluid. Although venous blood is said to be deoxygenated, some oxygen is still bound to
hemoglobin in its red blood cells. This provides an oxygen reserve that can be used when tissues suddenly demand more
oxygen.
 Factors other than partial pressure also affect the oxygenâ€”hemoglobin saturation/dissociation curve. For example, a
higher temperature promotes hemoglobin and oxygen to dissociate faster, whereas a lower temperature inhibits dissociation
(see Figure 22.26, middle). However, the human body tightly regulates temperature, so this factor may not affect gas
exchange throughout the body. The exception to this is in highly active tissues, which may release a larger amount of energy
than is given off as heat.
