They also support the cartilages that form the lateral walls of the nose (see Figure 7.11). These are the bones that are
damaged when the nose is broken.

 Lacrimal Bone

Each lacrimal bone is a small, rectangular bone that forms the anterior, medial wall of the orbit (see Figure 7.4 and Figure
7.5). The anterior portion of the lacrimal bone forms a shallow depression called the lacrimal fossa, and extending inferiorly
from this is the nasolacrimal canal. The lacrimal fluid (tears of the eye), which serves to maintain the moist surface of the
eye, drains at the medial corner of the eye into the nasolacrimal canal. This duct then extends downward to open into the
nasal cavity, behind the inferior nasal concha. In the nasal cavity, the lacrimal fluid normally drains posteriorly, but with an
increased flow of tears due to crying or eye irritation, some fluid will also drain anteriorly, thus causing a runny nose.
