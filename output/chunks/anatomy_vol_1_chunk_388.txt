They are essentially membranous bags,
with mesothelium lining the inside and connective tissue on the outside. Serous fluid secreted by the cells of the thin
squamous mesothelium lubricates the membrane and reduces abrasion and friction between organs. Serous membranes are
identified according locations. Three serous membranes line the thoracic cavity; the two pleura that cover the lungs and the
pericardium that covers the heart. A fourth, the peritoneum, is the serous membrane in the abdominal cavity that covers
abdominal organs and forms double sheets of mesenteries that suspend many of the digestive organs.

 The skin is an epithelial membrane also called the cutaneous membrane. It is a stratified squamous epithelial
membrane resting on top of connective tissue. The apical surface of this membrane is exposed to the external environment
and is covered with dead, keratinized cells that help protect the body from desiccation and pathogens.
