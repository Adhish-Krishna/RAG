When the receptors are full, the parathyroid gland stops secreting PTH.
 In the condition described, the parathyroid glands are not responding to the signal that there is sufficient calcium in the blood and
they keep releasing PTH, which causes the bone to release more calcium into the blood. Ultimately, the bones become fragile and
hypercalcemia can result.

1 The sphenoid bone joins with most other bones of the skull. It is centrally located, where it forms portions of the rounded brain
case and cranial base. 2 A basilar fracture may damage an artery entering the skull, causing bleeding in the brain. 3 Osteoporosis
causes thinning and weakening of the vertebral bodies. When this occurs in thoracic vertebrae, the bodies may collapse producing
kyphosis, an enhanced anterior curvature of the thoracic vertebral column. 4 Lifting a heavy object can cause an intervertebral
disc in the lower back to bulge and compress a spinal nerve as it exits through the intervertebral foramen, thus producing pain
in those regions of the lower limb supplied by that nerve.
