(c) Trabecular matrix and periosteum form. (d) Compact bone develops superficial to the trabecular bone,
and crowded blood vessels condense into red marrow.

 Intramembranous ossification begins in utero during fetal development and continues on into adolescence. At birth,
the skull and clavicles are not fully ossified nor are the sutures of the skull closed. This allows the skull and shoulders to

deform during passage through the birth canal. The last bones to ossify via intramembranous ossification are the flat bones
of the face, which reach their adult size at the end of the adolescent growth spurt.

 Endochondral Ossification

In endochondral ossification, bone develops by replacing hyaline cartilage. Cartilage does not become bone. Instead,
cartilage serves as a template to be completely replaced by new bone. Endochondral ossification takes much longer than
intramembranous ossification. Bones at the base of the skull and long bones form via endochondral ossification.
