When you eat an energy bar before heading out the door for
a hike, the honey, nuts, and other foods the bar contains are broken down and rearranged by your body into molecules that
your muscle cells convert to kinetic energy.

 Chemical reactions that release more energy than they absorb are characterized as exergonic. The catabolism of the
foods in your energy bar is an example. Some of the chemical energy stored in the bar is absorbed into molecules your body
uses for fuel, but some of it is releasedâ€”for example, as heat. In contrast, chemical reactions that absorb more energy than
they release are endergonic. These reactions require energy input, and the resulting molecule stores not only the chemical
energy in the original components, but also the energy that fueled the reaction. Because energy is neither created nor
destroyed, where does the energy needed for endergonic reactions come from? In many cases, it comes from exergonic
reactions.

Forms of Energy Important in Human Functioning

You have already learned that chemical energy is absorbed, stored, and released by chemical bonds.
