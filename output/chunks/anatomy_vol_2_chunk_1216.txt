Treatments generally involve providing intravenous fluids to restore the patient to normal function and various drugs
such as dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine to raise blood pressure.

 * Cardiogenic shock results from the inability of the heart to maintain cardiac output. Most often, it results from a
myocardial infarction (heart attack), but it may also be caused by arrhythmias, valve disorders, cardiomyopathies,
cardiac failure, or simply insufficient flow of blood through the cardiac vessels. Treatment involves repairing the
damage to the heart or its vessels to resolve the underlying cause, rather than treating cardiogenic shock directly.

 * Vascular shock occurs when arterioles lose their normal muscular tone and dilate dramatically. It may arise from a
variety of causes, and treatments almost always involve fluid replacement and medications, called inotropic or pressor
agents, which restore tone to the muscles of the vessels.
