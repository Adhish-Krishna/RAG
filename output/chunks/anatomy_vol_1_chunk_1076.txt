Resistance exercise affects muscles by increasing the
formation of myofibrils, thereby increasing the thickness of muscle fibers. This added structure causes hypertrophy, or the
enlargement of muscles, exemplified by the large skeletal muscles seen in body builders and other athletes (Figure 10.19).
 Because this muscular enlargement is achieved by the addition of structural proteins, athletes trying to build muscle mass
often ingest large amounts of protein.

 Except for the hypertrophy that follows an increase in the number of sarcomeres and myofibrils in a skeletal muscle,
the cellular changes observed during endurance training do not usually occur with resistance training. There is usually no
significant increase in mitochondria or capillary density. However, resistance training does increase the development of
connective tissue, which adds to the overall mass of the muscle and helps to contain muscles as they produce increasingly
powerful contractions.
