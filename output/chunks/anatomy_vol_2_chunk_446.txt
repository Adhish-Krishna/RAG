This response should sound a bit familiar. The autonomic nervous system is tied into emotional responses as well, and
the fight-or-flight response probably sounds like a panic attack. In the modern world, these sorts of reactions are associated
with anxiety as much as with response to a threat. It is engrained in the nervous system to respond like this. In fact,
the adaptations of the autonomic nervous system probably predate the human species and are likely to be common to all
mammals, and perhaps shared by many animals. That lioness might herself be threatened in some other situation.

 However, the autonomic nervous system is not just about responding to threats. Besides the fight-or-flight response,
there are the responses referred to as “rest and digest.” If that lioness is successful in her hunting, then she is going to rest
from the exertion. Her heart rate will slow. Breathing will return to normal. The digestive system has a big job to do.
