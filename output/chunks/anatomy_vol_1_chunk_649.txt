(b) The complex floor of
the cranial cavity is formed by the frontal, ethmoid, sphenoid, temporal, and occipital bones. The lesser wing of the
sphenoid bone separates the anterior and middle cranial fossae. The petrous ridge (petrous portion of temporal bone)
separates the middle and posterior cranial fossae.

 Frontal Bone

The frontal bone is the single bone that forms the forehead. At its anterior midline, between the eyebrows, there is a slight
depression called the glabella (see Figure 7.5). The frontal bone also forms the supraorbital margin of the orbit. Near the
middle of this margin, is the supraorbital foramen, the opening that provides passage for a sensory nerve to the forehead.
 The frontal bone is thickened just above each supraorbital margin, forming rounded brow ridges. These are located just
