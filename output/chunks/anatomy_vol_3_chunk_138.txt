Hemoglobin is partially saturated
when only some heme units are bound to oxygen. An oxygenâ€”hemoglobin saturation/dissociation curve is a common way to
depict the relationship of how easily oxygen binds to or dissociates from hemoglobin as a function of the partial pressure of
oxygen. As the partial pressure of oxygen increases, the more readily hemoglobin binds to oxygen. At the same time, once
one molecule of oxygen is bound by hemoglobin, additional oxygen molecules more readily bind to hemoglobin. Other
factors such as temperature, pH, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and the concentration of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate
can enhance or inhibit the binding of hemoglobin and oxygen as well. Fetal hemoglobin has a different structure than adult
hemoglobin, which results in fetal hemoglobin having a greater affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin.

 Carbon dioxide is transported in blood by three different mechanisms: as dissolved carbon dioxide, as bicarbonate,
or as carbaminohemoglobin.
