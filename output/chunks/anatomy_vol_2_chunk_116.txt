Propagation, as described above, applies to unmyelinated axons. When myelination is present, the action potential
propagates differently. Sodium ions that enter the cell at the initial segment start to spread along the length of the axon

segment, but there are no voltage-gated Na” channels until the first node of Ranvier. Because there is not constant opening
of these channels along the axon segment, the depolarization spreads at an optimal speed. The distance between nodes is
the optimal distance to keep the membrane still depolarized above threshold at the next node. As Na® spreads along the
inside of the membrane of the axon segment, the charge starts to dissipate. If the node were any farther down the axon, that
depolarization would have fallen off too much for voltage-gated Na* channels to be activated at the next node of Ranvier.
