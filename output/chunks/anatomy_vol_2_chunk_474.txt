Cannon’s original contribution was a catchy phrase to express some of what the nervous system does
in response to a threat, but it is incomplete. The sympathetic system is responsible for the physiological responses to
emotional states. The name “sympathetic” can be said to mean that (sym- = “together”; -pathos = “pain,” “suffering,”
or “emotion”).

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/nervsystem1) to learn more about the nervous system. As described
in this video, the nervous system has a way to deal with threats and stress that is separate from the conscious control of
the somatic nervous system. The system comes from a time when threats were about survival, but in the modern age,
these responses become part of stress and anxiety. This video describes how the autonomic system is only part of the
response to threats, or stressors.
