Most bones contain compact and
spongy osseous tissue, but their distribution and concentration vary based on the bone’s overall function. Compact bone is
dense so that it can withstand compressive forces, while spongy (cancellous) bone has open spaces and supports shifts in
weight distribution.

 Compact Bone

Compact bone is the denser, stronger of the two types of bone tissue (Figure 6.12). It can be found under the periosteum
and in the diaphyses of long bones, where it provides support and protection.
