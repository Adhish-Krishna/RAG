Amniotic cavity Cells differentiate at the primitive streak

3 and migrate to form a middle mesodermal
. layer, as well as displace most of the
Trophoblast hypoblast cells to form an endodermal layer.
 The ectoderm forms from the epiblast.

 Figure 28.9 Germ Layers Formation of the three primary germ layers occurs during the first 2 weeks of development.
 The embryo at this stage is only a few millimeters in length.

 Each of these germ layers will develop into specific structures in the embryo. Whereas the ectoderm and endoderm
form tightly connected epithelial sheets, the mesodermal cells are less organized and exist as a loosely connected cell
community. The ectoderm gives rise to cell lineages that differentiate to become the central and peripheral nervous systems,
sensory organs, epidermis, hair, and nails.
