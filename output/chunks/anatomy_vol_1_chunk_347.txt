These signals are maintained in an intricate balance so
that the cell only proceeds to the next phase when it is ready. This homeostatic control of the cell cycle can be thought
of like a carâ€™s cruise control. Cruise control will continually apply just the right amount of acceleration to maintain
a desired speed, unless the driver hits the brakes, in which case the car will slow down. Similarly, the cell includes
molecular messengers, such as cyclins, that push the cell forward in its cycle.

 In addition to cyclins, a class of proteins that are encoded by genes called proto-oncogenes provide important
signals that regulate the cell cycle and move it forward. Examples of proto-oncogene products include cell-surface
receptors for growth factors, or cell-signaling molecules, two classes of molecules that can promote DNA replication
and cell division.
