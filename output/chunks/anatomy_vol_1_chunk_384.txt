Each germ layer is identified by its relative position: ectoderm (ecto-
= “outer”), mesoderm (meso- = “middle”), and endoderm (endo- = “inner”). Figure 4.3 shows the types of tissues and
organs associated with the each of the three germ layers. Note that epithelial tissue originates in all three layers, whereas
nervous tissue derives primarily from the ectoderm and muscle tissue from mesoderm.

Ectoderm Epidermis, glands on skin, some cranial bones, pituitary and adrenal medulla, the nervous
system, the mouth between cheek and gums, the anus
Skin cells Neurons Pigment cell
Mesoderm Connective tissues proper, bone, cartilage, blood, endothelium of blood vessels, muscle,
synovial membranes, serous membranes lining body cavities, kidneys, lining of gonads
Cardiac Skeletal Tubule cell Red blood Smooth
muscle muscle of kidney cells muscle

Pancreatic cell

Endoderm Lining of airways and digestive system except the mouth and distal part of digestive system
(rectum and anal canal); glands (digestive glands, endocrine glands, adrenal cortex)
