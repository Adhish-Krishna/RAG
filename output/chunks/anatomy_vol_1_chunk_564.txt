Figure 6.10 Bone Features The surface features of bones depend on their function, location, attachment of
ligaments and tendons, or the penetration of blood vessels and nerves.

 Bone Cells and Tissue

Bone contains a relatively small number of cells entrenched in a matrix of collagen fibers that provide a surface for
inorganic salt crystals to adhere. These salt crystals form when calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate combine to create
hydroxyapatite, which incorporates other inorganic salts like magnesium hydroxide, fluoride, and sulfate as it crystallizes,
or calcifies, on the collagen fibers.
