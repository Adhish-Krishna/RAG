Some examples of these are other lipids, oxygen and carbon dioxide gases,
and alcohol. However, water-soluble materials—like glucose, amino acids, and electrolytes—need some assistance to cross
the membrane because they are repelled by the hydrophobic tails of the phospholipid bilayer. All substances that move
through the membrane do so by one of two general methods, which are categorized based on whether or not energy is
required. Passive transport is the movement of substances across the membrane without the expenditure of cellular energy.
 In contrast, active transport is the movement of substances across the membrane using energy from adenosine triphosphate
(ATP).

 Passive Transport

In order to understand how substances move passively across a cell membrane, it is necessary to understand concentration
gradients and diffusion. A concentration gradient is the difference in concentration of a substance across a space.
 Molecules (or ions) will spread/diffuse from where they are more concentrated to where they are less concentrated until they
are equally distributed in that space.
