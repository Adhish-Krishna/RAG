Because they are connected
with gap junctions to surrounding muscle fibers and the specialized fibers of the heart’s conduction system, the pacemaker
cells are able to transfer the depolarization to the other cardiac muscle fibers in a manner that allows the heart to contract in
a coordinated manner.

 Another feature of cardiac muscle is its relatively long action potentials in its fibers, having a sustained depolarization

“plateau.” The plateau is produced by Ca** entry though voltage-gated calcium channels in the sarcolemma of cardiac
muscle fibers. This sustained depolarization (and Ca** entry) provides for a longer contraction than is produced by an action

potential in skeletal muscle. Unlike skeletal muscle, a large percentage of the Ca** that initiates contraction in cardiac
muscles comes from outside the cell rather than from the SR.
