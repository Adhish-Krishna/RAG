A couple of days later, a positive test is indicated by a raised red area that is hard to
the touch, called an induration, which is a consequence of the cellular infiltrate, an accumulation of activated macrophages.
 A positive tuberculin test means that the patient has been exposed to the bacteria and exhibits a cellular immune response
to it.

 Another type of delayed hypersensitivity is contact sensitivity, where substances such as the metal nickel cause a red
and swollen area upon contact with the skin. The individual must have been previously sensitized to the metal. A much
more severe case of contact sensitivity is poison ivy, but many of the harshest symptoms of the reaction are associated with
the toxicity of its oils and are not T cell mediated.

 Autoimmune Responses

The worst cases of the immune system over-reacting are autoimmune diseases. Somehow, tolerance breaks down and the
immune systems in individuals with these diseases begin to attack their own bodies, causing significant damage.
