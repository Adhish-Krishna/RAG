It has a pair of lesser wings and a pair
of greater wings. The sella turcica surrounds the hypophyseal fossa. Projecting downward are the medial and lateral
pterygoid plates. The sphenoid has multiple openings for the passage of nerves and blood vessels, including the optic
canal, superior orbital fissure, foramen rotundum, foramen ovale, and foramen spinosum.

 Ethmoid Bone

The ethmoid bone is a single, midline bone that forms the roof and lateral walls of the upper nasal cavity, the upper portion
of the nasal septum, and contributes to the medial wall of the orbit (Figure 7.11 and Figure 7.12). On the interior of the
skull, the ethmoid also forms a portion of the floor of the anterior cranial cavity (see Figure 7.8b).

 Within the nasal cavity, the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone forms the upper portion of the nasal septum. The
ethmoid bone also forms the lateral walls of the upper nasal cavity. Extending from each lateral wall are the superior nasal
concha and middle nasal concha, which are thin, curved projections that extend into the nasal cavity (Figure 7.13).
