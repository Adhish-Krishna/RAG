They also lack endoplasmic reticula and do not synthesize proteins. Erythrocytes do, however, contain some
structural proteins that help the blood cells maintain their unique structure and enable them to change their shape to squeeze
through capillaries. This includes the protein spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein element.

 Erythrocytes are biconcave disks; that is, they are plump at their periphery and very thin in the center (Figure 18.6).
 Since they lack most organelles, there is more interior space for the presence of the hemoglobin molecules that, as you wil.
see shortly, transport gases. The biconcave shape also provides a greater surface area across which gas exchange can occur,
relative to its volume; a sphere of a similar diameter would have a lower surface area-to-volume ratio. In the capillaries,
the oxygen carried by the erythrocytes can diffuse into the plasma and then through the capillary walls to reach the cells,
whereas some of the carbon dioxide produced by the cells as a waste product diffuses into the capillaries to be picked up by
the erythrocytes.
