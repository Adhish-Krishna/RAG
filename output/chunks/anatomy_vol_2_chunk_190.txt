It separates the cerebrum
into two distinct halves, a right and left cerebral hemisphere. Deep within the cerebrum, the white matter of the corpus
callosum provides the major pathway for communication between the two hemispheres of the cerebral cortex.

of it is the folded surface called the cerebral cortex.

 Many of the higher neurological functions, such as memory, emotion, and consciousness, are the result of cerebral
function. The complexity of the cerebrum is different across vertebrate species. The cerebrum of the most primitive
vertebrates is not much more than the connection for the sense of smell.
