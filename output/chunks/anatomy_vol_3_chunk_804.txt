Mesodermal cells ultimately become the skeleton, muscles, connective tissue,
heart, blood vessels, and kidneys. The endoderm goes on to form the epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and
pancreas, as well as the lungs (Figure 28.10).

Figure 28.10 Fates of Germ Layers in Embryo Following gastrulation of the embryo in the third week, embryonic
cells of the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm begin to migrate and differentiate into the cell lineages that will give
rise to mature organs and organ systems in the infant.
