In particular, BPA mimics the hormonal
effects of estrogens and has the opposite effect—that of androgens. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
notes in their statement about BPA safety that although traditional toxicology studies have supported the safety of low
levels of exposure to BPA, recent studies using novel approaches to test for subtle effects have led to some concern
about the potential effects of BPA on the brain, behavior, and prostate gland in fetuses, infants, and young children. The
FDA is currently facilitating decreased use of BPA in food-related materials. Many US companies have voluntarily
removed BPA from baby bottles, “sippy” cups, and the linings of infant formula cans, and most plastic reusable water
bottles sold today boast that they are “BPA free.” In contrast, both Canada and the European Union have completely
banned the use of BPA in baby products.
 The potential harmful effects of BPA have been studied in both animal models and humans and include a large
variety of health effects, such as developmental delay and disease.
