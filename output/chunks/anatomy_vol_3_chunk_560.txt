Specialized cells in the JGA produce
paracrine signals to regulate blood flow and filtration rates of the glomerulus. Other JGA cells produce the enzyme renin,
which plays a central role in blood pressure regulation. The filtrate enters the PCT where absorption and secretion of severa
substances occur. The descending and ascending limbs of the loop of Henle consist of thick and thin segments. Absorption
and secretion continue in the DCT but to a lesser extent than in the PCT. Each collecting duct collects forming urine from
several nephrons and responds to the posterior pituitary hormone ADH by inserting aquaporin water channels into the cell
membrane to fine tune water recovery. 

25.5 Physiology of Urine Formation

The entire volume o:

the blood is filtered through the kidneys about 300 times per day, and 99 percent of the water filtered
is recovered. The GFR is influenced by hydrostatic pressure and colloid osmotic pressure. Under normal circumstances,
hydrostatic pressure is significantly greater and filtration occurs. The hydrostatic pressure of the glomerulus depends on
systemic blood pressure, autoregulatory mechanisms, sympathetic nervous activity, and paracrine hormones.
