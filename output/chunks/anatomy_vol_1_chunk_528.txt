This is referred to as the “rule of
nines,” which associates specific anatomical areas with a percentage that is a factor of nine (Figure 5.23). Burns are also
classified by the degree of their severity. A first-degree burn is a superficial burn that affects only the epidermis. Although
the skin may be painful and swollen, these burns typically heal on their own within a few days. Mild sunburn fits into the
category of a first-degree burn. A second-degree burn goes deeper and affects both the epidermis and a portion of the
dermis. These burns result in swelling and a painful blistering of the skin. It is important to keep the burn site clean and
sterile to prevent infection. If this is done, the burn will heal within several weeks. A third-degree burn fully extends into
the epidermis and dermis, destroying the tissue and affecting the nerve endings and sensory function.
