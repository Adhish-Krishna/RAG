In a healthy patient,
the sound would appear equally loud in both ears. With unilateral conductive hearing loss, however, the tuning fork sounds
louder in the ear with hearing loss. This is because the sound of the tuning fork has to compete with background noise
coming from the outer ear, but in conductive hearing loss, the background noise is blocked in the damaged ear, allowing the
tuning fork to sound relatively louder in that ear. With unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, however, damage to the cochlea
or associated nervous tissue means that the tuning fork sounds quieter in that ear.

 The trigeminal system of the head and neck is the equivalent of the ascending spinal cord systems of the dorsal column
and the spinothalamic pathways. Somatosensation of the face is conveyed along the nerve to enter the brain stem at the
level of the pons. Synapses of those axons, however, are distributed across nuclei found throughout the brain stem. The
mesencephalic nucleus processes proprioceptive information of the face, which is the movement and position of facial
muscles.
