Immediate vasoconstriction to increase blood pressure is the result. ADH also
causes activation of aquaporin channels in the collecting ducts to affect the recovery of water to help restore vascular
volume.

 Diuretics and Fluid Volume

A diuretic is a compound that increases urine volume. Three familiar drinks contain diuretic compounds: coffee, tea, and
alcohol. The caffeine in coffee and tea works by promoting vasodilation in the nephron, which increases GFR. Alcohol
increases GFR by inhibiting ADH release from the posterior pituitary, resulting in less water recovery by the collecting duct.
 In cases of high blood pressure, diuretics may be prescribed to reduce blood volume and, thereby, reduce blood pressure.

 The most frequently prescribed anti-hypertensive diuretic is hydrochlorothiazide. It inhibits the Na*/ CI‚Äù symporter in the

DCT and collecting duct. The result is a loss of Na* with water following passively by osmosis.

 Osmotic diuretics promote water loss by osmosis. An example is the indigestible sugar mannitol, which is most often
administered to reduce brain swelling after head injury.
