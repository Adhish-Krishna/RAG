Intestinal MALT

The lamina propria of the small intestine mucosa is studded with quite a bit of MALT. In addition to solitary lymphatic
nodules, aggregations of intestinal MALT, which are typically referred to as Peyer’s patches, are concentrated in the distal
ileum, and serve to keep bacteria from entering the bloodstream. Peyer’s patches are most prominent in young people and
become less distinct as you age, which coincides with the general activity of our immune system.

 Watch this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/sintestine) that depicts the structure of the small intestine, and, in
particular, the villi. Epithelial cells continue the digestion and absorption of nutrients and transport these nutrients to
the lymphatic and circulatory systems. In the small intestine, the products of food digestion are absorbed by different
structures in the villi.
