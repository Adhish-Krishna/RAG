The largest of the conchae is the inferior nasal concha, which is
an independent bone of the skull. The middle concha and the superior conchae, which is the smallest, are both formed by
the ethmoid bone. When looking into the anterior nasal opening of the skull, only the inferior and middle conchae can be
seen. The small superior nasal concha is well hidden above and behind the middle concha.

Figure 7.17 Nasal Septum The nasal septum is formed by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone and the
vomer bone. The septal cartilage fills the gap between these bones and extends into the nose.

 Cranial Fossae

Inside the skull, the floor of the cranial cavity is subdivided into three cranial fossae (spaces), which increase in depth from
anterior to posterior (see Figure 7.6, Figure 7.8b, and Figure 7.11).
