CHAPTER 28 | DEVELOPMENT AND INHERITANCE 1241

Contact with the zona pellucida
triggers the acrosome reaction,
causing sperm to secrete
digestive enzymes that
break down the glycoprotein
membrane of the zona
pellucida and help to

expose the oocyte’s
plasma membrane.

in burrowing through the ;

Zona pellucida
and making contact with the oocyte’s
plasma membrane. The sperm's.

plasma membrane fuses with that of the
oocyte and the sperm releases its nucleus
into the cytoplasm of the oocyte.

— Corona radiata

Figure 28.2 Sperm and the Process of Fertilization Before fertilization, hundreds of capacitated sperm must break
through the surrounding corona radiata and zona pellucida so that one can contact and fuse with the oocyte plasma
membrane.
