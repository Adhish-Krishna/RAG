The greater
sciatic notch of the male hip bone is narrower and deeper than the broader notch of females. Because the female pelvis
is adapted for childbirth, it is wider than the male pelvis, as evidenced by the distance between the anterior superior iliac
spines (see Figure 8.15). The ischial tuberosities of females are also farther apart, which increases the size of the pelvic
outlet. Because of this increased pelvic width, the subpubic angle is larger in females (greater than 80 degrees) than it is in
males (less than 70 degrees). The female sacrum is wider, shorter, and less curved, and the sacral promontory projects less

into the pelvic cavity, thus giving the female pelvic inlet (pelvic brim) a more rounded or oval shape compared to males.
