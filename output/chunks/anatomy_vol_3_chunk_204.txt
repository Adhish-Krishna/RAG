The inferior border of the laryngopharynx connects to the esophagus, whereas the anterior
portion connects to the larynx, allowing air to flow into the bronchial tree.

Figure 23.12 Pharynx The pharynx runs from the nostrils to the esophagus and the larynx.

 Histologically, the wall of the oropharynx is similar to that of the oral cavity. The mucosa includes a stratified
squamous epithelium that is endowed with mucus-producing glands. During swallowing, the elevator skeletal muscles of
the pharynx contract, raising and expanding the pharynx to receive the bolus of food. Once received, these muscles relax
and the constrictor muscles of the pharynx contract, forcing the bolus into the esophagus and initiating peristalsis.
