Both neurons and skeletal muscle cells are electrically excitable, meaning that they are able to generate action
potentials. An action potential is a special type of electrical signal that can travel along a cell membrane as a wave. This
allows a signal to be transmitted quickly and faithfully over long distances.

 Although the term excitation-contraction coupling confuses or scares some students, it comes down to this: for a
skeletal muscle fiber to contract, its membrane must first be “excited”—in other words, it must be stimulated to fire an
action potential. The muscle fiber action potential, which sweeps along the sarcolemma as a wave, is “coupled” to the actual

contraction through the release of calcium ions (Ca**) from the SR. Once released, the Ca** interacts with the shielding
proteins, forcing them to move aside so that the actin-binding sites are available for attachment by myosin heads.
