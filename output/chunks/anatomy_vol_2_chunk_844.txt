Researchers now suspect that interleukins may play other roles in body functioning, including differentiation and
maturation of cells, producing immunity and inflammation. To date, more than a dozen interleukins have been
identified, with others likely to follow. They are generally numbered IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, etc.

Blood Doping

 In its original intent, the term blood doping was used to describe the practice of injecting by transfusion supplemental
RBCs into an individual, typically to enhance performance in a sport. Additional RBCs would deliver more oxygen
to the tissues, providing extra aerobic capacity, clinically referred to as VO2 max. The source of the cells was either
from the recipient (autologous) or from a donor with compatible blood (homologous). This practice was aided by
the well-developed techniques of harvesting, concentrating, and freezing of the RBCs that could be later thawed and
injected, yet still retain their functionality.
