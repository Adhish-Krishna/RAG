Figure 27.4 Anatomy of the Testis This sagittal view shows the seminiferous tubules, the site of sperm production.
 Formed sperm are transferred to the epididymis, where they mature. They leave the epididymis during an ejaculation
via the ductus deferens.

 The tightly coiled seminiferous tubules form the bulk of each testis. They are composed of developing sperm cells
surrounding a lumen, the hollow center of the tubule, where formed sperm are released into the duct system of the testis.
 Specifically, from the lumens of the seminiferous tubules, sperm move into the straight tubules (or tubuli recti), and from
there into a fine meshwork of tubules called the rete testes. Sperm leave the rete testes, and the testis itself, through the 15
to 20 efferent ductules that cross the tunica albuginea.

 Inside the seminiferous tubules are six different cell types. These include supporting cells called sustentacular cells,
as well as five types of developing sperm cells called germ cells.
