When both the sternocleidomastoids contract, the head flexes forward; individually, they cause
rotation to the opposite side. The trapezius can act as an antagonist, causing extension and hyperextension of the neck.
 These two superficial muscles are important for changing the position of the head. Both muscles also receive input from
cervical spinal nerves. Along with the spinal accessory nerve, these nerves contribute to elevating the scapula and clavicle
through the trapezius, which is tested by asking the patient to shrug both shoulders, and watching for asymmetry. For the
sternocleidomastoid, those spinal nerves are primarily sensory projections, whereas the trapezius also has lateral insertions
to the clavicle and scapula, and receives motor input from the spinal cord. Calling the nerve the spinal accessory nerve
suggests that it is aiding the spinal nerves. Though that is not precisely how the name originated, it does help make the
association between the function of this nerve in controlling these muscles and the role these muscles play in movements of
the trunk or shoulders.
