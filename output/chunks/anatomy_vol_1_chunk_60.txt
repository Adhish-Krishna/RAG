As sweat evaporates from skin, it removes some thermal energy from the body,
cooling it. Adequate water (from the extracellular fluid in the body) is necessary to produce sweat, so adequate fluid intake
is essential to balance that loss during the sweat response. Not surprisingly, the sweat response is much less effective in
a humid environment because the air is already saturated with water. Thus, the sweat on the skinâ€™s surface is not able to
evaporate, and internal body temperature can get dangerously high.

The body can also respond effectively to short-term exposure to cold.
