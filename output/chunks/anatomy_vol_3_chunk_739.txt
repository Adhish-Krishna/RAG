These lactiferous ducts each extend
to a lactiferous sinus that connects to a glandular lobe within the breast itself that contains groups of milk-secreting cells in
clusters called alveoli (see Figure 27.17). The clusters can change in size depending on the amount of milk in the alveolar
lumen. Once milk is made in the alveoli, stimulated myoepithelial cells that surround the alveoli contract to push the milk to
the lactiferous sinuses. From here, the baby can draw milk through the lactiferous ducts by suckling. The lobes themselves
are surrounded by fat tissue, which determines the size of the breast; breast size differs between individuals and does
not affect the amount of milk produced. Supporting the breasts are multiple bands of connective tissue called suspensory
ligaments that connect the breast tissue to the dermis of the overlying skin.
