This
motion is produced by rotation of the radius at the proximal radioulnar joint, accompanied by movement of the radius at
the distal radioulnar joint. The proximal radioulnar joint is a pivot joint that allows for rotation of the head of the radius.
 Because of the slight curvature of the shaft of the radius, this rotation causes the distal end of the radius to cross over the
distal ulna at the distal radioulnar joint. This crossing over brings the radius and ulna into an X-shape position. Supination
is the opposite motion, in which rotation of the radius returns the bones to their parallel positions and moves the palm to the
anterior facing (supinated) position. It helps to remember that supination is the motion you use when scooping up soup with
a spoon (see Figure 9.13g).

Dorsiflexion and Plantar Flexion

Dorsiflexion and plantar flexion are movements at the ankle joint, which is a hinge joint.
