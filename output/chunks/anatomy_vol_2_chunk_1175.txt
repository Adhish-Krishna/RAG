As leg muscles contract, for example during walking or
running, they exert pressure on nearby veins with their numerous one-way valves. This increased pressure causes blood to
flow upward, opening valves superior to the contracting muscles so blood flows through. Simultaneously, valves inferior
to the contracting muscles close; thus, blood should not seep back downward toward the feet. Military recruits are trained
to flex their legs slightly while standing at attention for prolonged periods. Failure to do so may allow blood to pool in the
lower limbs rather than returning to the heart. Consequently, the brain will not receive enough oxygenated blood, and the
individual may lose consciousness.

Figure 20.15 Skeletal Muscle Pump The contraction of skeletal muscles surrounding a vein compresses the blood
and increases the pressure in that area.
