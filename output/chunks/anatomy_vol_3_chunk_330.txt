Catabolic hormones stimulate the
breakdown of molecules and the production of energy. These include cortisol, glucagon, adrenaline/epinephrine, and
cytokines. All of these hormones are mobilized at specific times to meet the needs of the body. Anabolic hormones are
required for the synthesis of molecules and include growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor, insulin, testosterone, and
estrogen. Table 24.1 summarizes the function of each of the catabolic hormones and Table 24.2 summarizes the functions
of the anabolic hormones.

 Catabolic Hormones

Hormone Function
F Released from the adrenal gland in response to stress; its main role is to increase blood
Cortisol . . :
glucose levels by gluconeogenesis (breaking down fats and proteins)
Released from alpha cells in the pancreas either when starving or when the body needs to
generate additional energy; it stimulates the breakdown of glycogen in the liver to increase
Glucagon - P ; - . .
blood glucose levels; its effect is the opposite of insulin; glucagon and insulin are a part of a
negative-feedback system that stabilizes blood glucose levels
- Released in response to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system; increases heart rate
Adrenaline/ - - - : :
