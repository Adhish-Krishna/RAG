Since the brain occupies these areas, the shape of each
conforms to the shape of the brain regions that it contains. Each cranial fossa has anterior and posterior boundaries and is
divided at the midline into right and left areas by a significant bony structure or opening.

 Anterior Cranial Fossa

The anterior cranial fossa is the most anterior and the shallowest of the three cranial fossae. It overlies the orbits and contains
the frontal lobes of the brain. Anteriorly, the anterior fossa is bounded by the frontal bone, which also forms the majority of
the floor for this space. The lesser wings of the sphenoid bone form the prominent ledge that marks the boundary between
the anterior and middle cranial fossae. Located in the floor of the anterior cranial fossa at the midline is a portion of the
ethmoid bone, consisting of the upward projecting crista galli and to either side of this, the cribriform plates.
