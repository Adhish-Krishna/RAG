What is the large opening in the bony pelvis, located between the ischium and pubic regions, and what two parts of the
pubis contribute to the formation of this opening?

 The sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments also help to define two openings on the posterolateral sides of the pelvis
through which muscles, nerves, and blood vessels for the lower limb exit. The superior opening is the greater sciatic
foramen. This large opening is formed by the greater sciatic notch of the hip bone, the sacrum, and the sacrospinous
ligament. The smaller, more inferior lesser sciatic foramen is formed by the lesser sciatic notch of the hip bone, together
with the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments.

 The space enclosed by the bony pelvis is divided into two regions (Figure 8.15). The broad, superior region, defined
laterally by the large, fan-like portion of the upper hip bone, is called the greater pelvis (greater pelvic cavity; false pelvis).
