Hearing is tested by using a tuning fork in a couple of different ways. The Rinne test involves using a tuning fork
to distinguish between conductive hearing and sensorineural hearing. Conductive hearing relies on vibrations being
conducted through the ossicles of the middle ear. Sensorineural hearing is the transmission of sound stimuli through the
neural components of the inner ear and cranial nerve. A vibrating tuning fork is placed on the mastoid process and the
patient indicates when the sound produced from this is no longer present. Then the fork is immediately moved to just next to
the ear canal so the sound travels through the air. If the sound is not heard through the ear, meaning the sound is conducted
better through the temporal bone than through the ossicles, a conductive hearing deficit is present. The Weber test also uses
a tuning fork to differentiate between conductive versus sensorineural hearing loss. In this test, the tuning fork is placed at
the top of the skull, and the sound of the tuning fork reaches both inner ears by travelling through bone.
