Figure 21.28 Immune Hypersensitivity Components of the immune system cause four types of hypersensitivity.
 Notice that types I-III are B cell mediated, whereas type IV hypersensitivity is exclusively a T cell phenomenon.

 Immediate (Type I) Hypersensitivity

Antigens that cause allergic responses are often referred to as allergens. The specificity of the immediate hypersensitivity
response is predicated on the binding of allergen-specific IgE to the mast cell surface. The process of producing allergen-
specific IgE is called sensitization, and is a necessary prerequisite for the symptoms of immediate hypersensitivity to
occur. Allergies and allergic asthma are mediated by mast cell degranulation that is caused by the crosslinking of the
antigen-specific IgE molecules on the mast cell surface. The mediators released have various vasoactive effects already
discussed, but the major symptoms of inhaled allergens are the nasal edema and runny nose caused by the increased
vascular permeability and increased blood flow of nasal blood vessels.
