This inner functional layer provides the proper site of implantation for the fertilized egg, and—should
fertilization not occur—it is only the stratum functionalis layer of the endometrium that sheds during menstruation.

 Recall that during the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle, the tertiary follicles are growing and secreting estrogen. At
the same time, the stratum functionalis of the endometrium is thickening to prepare for a potential implantation. The post-
ovulatory increase in progesterone, which characterizes the luteal phase, is key for maintaining a thick stratum functionalis.
 As long as a functional corpus luteum is present in the ovary, the endometrial lining is prepared for implantation. Indeed, i
an embryo implants, signals are sent to the corpus luteum to continue secreting progesterone to maintain the endometrium,
and thus maintain the pregnancy. If an embryo does not implant, no signal is sent to the corpus luteum and it degrades,
ceasing progesterone production and ending the luteal phase.
