Cardiac muscle, found in the heart, is concerned with pumping blood through
the circulatory system. Smooth muscle is concerned with various involuntary movements, such as having one’s hair stand
on end when cold or frightened, or moving food through the digestive system. This chapter will examine the structure and
function of these three types of muscles.


 378 CHAPTER 10 | MUSCLE TISSUE

10.1 | Overview of Muscle Tissues

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the different types of muscle
¢ Explain contractibility and extensibility

Muscle is one of the four primary tissue types of the body, and the body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal
muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle (Figure 10.2). All three muscle tissues have some properties in common; they
all exhibit a quality called excitability as their plasma membranes can change their electrical states (from polarized to
depolarized) and send an electrical wave called an action potential along the entire length of the membrane.
