This
receptor is associated with an intracellular component called a G protein, and binding of the hormone activates the G-
protein component (Step 2). The activated G protein in turn activates an enzyme called adenylyl cyclase, also known as
adenylate cyclase (Step 3), which converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cAMP (Step 4). As the second messenger,
cAMP activates a type of enzyme called a protein kinase that is present in the cytosol (Step 5). Activated protein kinases
initiate a phosphorylation cascade, in which multiple protein kinases phosphorylate (add a phosphate group to) numerous
and various cellular proteins, including other enzymes (Step 6).

 694 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

@ Water-soluble hormones are
membrane insoluble. They
bind to membrane receptors.

 Extracellular fluid

@ The binding activates
a G protein.

@ The activated G protein
activates adenylyl cyclase.

@ Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes
the conversion of ATP to
cAMP, the secondary
messenger in this pathway.
