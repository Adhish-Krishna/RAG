into ATP

pancreatic lipases enzymes released from the pancreas that digest lipids in the diet

pepsin enzyme that begins to break down proteins in the stomach

polysaccharides complex carbohydrates made up of many monosaccharides

postabsorptive state also called the fasting state; the metabolic state occurring after digestion when food is no longer

the body’s source of energy and it must rely on stored glycogen

proteolysis process of breaking proteins into smaller peptides

pyruvate three-carbon end product of glycolysis and starting material that is converted into acetyl CoA that enters the
Krebs cycle

radiation transfer of heat via infrared waves

reduction gaining of an electron

salivary amylase digestive enzyme that is found in the saliva and begins the digestion of carbohydrates in the mouth
secretin hormone released in the small intestine to aid in digestion

sodium bicarbonate anion released into the small intestine to neutralize the pH of the food from the stomach
terminal electron acceptor oxygen, the recipient of the free hydrogen at the end of the electron transport chain
thermoneutral external temperature at which the body does not expend any energy for thermoregulation, about 84 °F
thermoregulation process of regulating the temperature of the body

transamination transfer of an amine group from one molecule to another as a way to turn nitrogen waste into ammonia
so that it can enter the urea cycle

tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) also called the Krebs cycle or the citric acid cycle; converts pyruvate into CO2 and
high-energy FADH2, NADH, and ATP molecules

triglycerides lipids, or fats, consisting of three fatty acid chains attached to a glycerol backbone

trypsinogen proenzyme form of trypsin

trypsin pancreatic enzyme that activates chymotrypsin and digests protein

urea cycle process that converts potentially toxic nitrogen waste into urea that can be eliminated through the kidneys

vitamins organic compounds required by the body to perform biochemical reactions like metabolism and bone, cell, and
tissue growth

CHAPTER REVIEW

24.1 Overview of Metabolic Reactions

Metabolism is the sum of all catabolic (break down) and anabolic (synthesis) reactions in the body.
