Due to this design,
the muscle fibers in a pennate muscle can only pull at an angle, and as a result, contracting pennate muscles do not move
their tendons very far. However, because a pennate muscle generally can hold more muscle fibers within it, it can produce
relatively more tension for its size. There are three subtypes of pennate muscles.

 In a unipennate muscle, the fascicles are located on one side of the tendon. The extensor digitorum of the forearm
is an example of a unipennate muscle. A bipennate muscle has fascicles on both sides of the tendon. In some pennate
muscles, the muscle fibers wrap around the tendon, sometimes forming individual fascicles in the process. This arrangement
is referred to as multipennate. A common example is the deltoid muscle of the shoulder, which covers the shoulder but has
a single tendon that inserts on the deltoid tuberosity of the humerus.
