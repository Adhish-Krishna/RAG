This new complex, called a
chylomicron, is a water-soluble lipoprotein. After being processed by the Golgi apparatus, chylomicrons are released from
the cell (Figure 23.33). Too big to pass through the basement membranes of blood capillaries, chylomicrons instead enter
the large pores of lacteals. The lacteals come together to form the lymphatic vessels. The chylomicrons are transported in
the lymphatic vessels and empty through the thoracic duct into the subclavian vein of the circulatory system. Once in the
bloodstream, the enzyme lipoprotein lipase breaks down the triglycerides of the chylomicrons into free fatty acids and
glycerol. These breakdown products then pass through capillary walls to be used for energy by cells or stored in adipose
tissue as fat. Liver cells combine the remaining chylomicron remnants with proteins, forming lipoproteins that transport
cholesterol in the blood.
