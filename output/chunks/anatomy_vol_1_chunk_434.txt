The cardiac muscle pumps blood through the body and is under involuntary control. The attachment junctions hold
adjacent cells together across the dynamic pressures changes of the cardiac cycle.

 Smooth muscle tissue contraction is responsible for involuntary movements in the internal organs. It forms the
contractile component of the digestive, urinary, and reproductive systems as well as the airways and arteries. Each cell is
spindle shaped with a single nucleus and no visible striations (Figure 4.18).
