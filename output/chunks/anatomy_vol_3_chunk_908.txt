During pregnancy, the body prepares for lactation by stimulating the growth and development of branching lactiferous
ducts and alveoli lined with milk-secreting lactocytes, and by creating colostrum. These functions are attributable to the
actions of several hormones, including prolactin. Following childbirth, suckling triggers oxytocin release, which stimulates
myoepithelial cells to squeeze milk from alveoli. Breast milk then drains toward the nipple pores to be consumed by the
infant. Colostrum, the milk produced in the first postpartum days, provides immunoglobulins that increase the newborn’s
immune defenses. Colostrum, transitional milk, and mature breast milk are ideally suited to each stage of the newborn’s
development, and breastfeeding helps the newborn’s digestive system expel meconium and clear bilirubin. Mature milk
