It can only be maintained with adequate ATP.

 Muscle Tone

Skeletal muscles are rarely completely relaxed, or flaccid. Even if a muscle is not producing movement, it is contracted a
small amount to maintain its contractile proteins and produce muscle tone. The tension produced by muscle tone allows
muscles to continually stabilize joints and maintain posture.

CHAPTER 10| MUSCLE TISSUE 397

Muscle tone is accomplished by a complex interaction between the nervous system and skeletal muscles that results
in the activation of a few motor units at a time, most likely in a cyclical manner. In this manner, muscles never fatigue
completely, as some motor units can recover while others are active.

 The absence of the low-level contractions that lead to muscle tone is referred to as hypotonia or atrophy, and can result
from damage to parts of the central nervous system (CNS), such as the cerebellum, or from loss of innervations to a skeletal
muscle, as in poliomyelitis.
