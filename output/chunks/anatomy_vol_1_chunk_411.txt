Adipose cells store surplus energy in the form of fat and
contribute to the thermal insulation of the body.

 Embryonic Connective Tissue

All connective tissues derive from the mesodermal layer of the embryo (see Figure 4.3). The first connective tissue to
develop in the embryo is mesenchyme, the stem cell line from which all connective tissues are later derived. Clusters
of mesenchymal cells are scattered throughout adult tissue and supply the cells needed for replacement and repair after
a connective tissue injury. A second type of embryonic connective tissue forms in the umbilical cord, called mucous

connective tissue or Whartonâ€™s jelly. This tissue is no longer present after birth, leaving only scattered mesenchymal cells
throughout the body.

 Classification of Connective Tissues

The three broad categories of connective tissue are classified according to the characteristics of their ground substance
and the types of fibers found within the matrix (Table 4.1).
