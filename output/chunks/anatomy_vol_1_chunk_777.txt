The humerus is the single bone of the upper arm region. It articulates with the
radius and ulna bones of the forearm to form the elbow joint.

 Distally, the humerus becomes flattened. The prominent bony projection on the medial side is the medial epicondyle of
the humerus. The much smaller lateral epicondyle of the humerus is found on the lateral side of the distal humerus. The
roughened ridge of bone above the lateral epicondyle is the lateral supracondylar ridge. All of these areas are attachment
points for muscles that act on the forearm, wrist, and hand. The powerful grasping muscles of the anterior forearm arise
from the medial epicondyle, which is thus larger and more robust than the lateral epicondyle that gives rise to the weaker
posterior forearm muscles.

 The distal end of the humerus has two articulation areas, which join the ulna and radius bones of the forearm to form
the elbow joint.
