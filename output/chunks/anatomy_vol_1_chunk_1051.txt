The force
generated by the contraction of the muscle (or shortening of the sarcomeres) is called muscle tension. However, muscle
tension also is generated when the muscle is contracting against a load that does not move, resulting in two main types of
skeletal muscle contractions: isotonic contractions and isometric contractions.

 In isotonic contractions, where the tension in the muscle stays constant, a load is moved as the length of the muscle
changes (shortens). There are two types of isotonic contractions: concentric and eccentric. A concentric contraction
involves the muscle shortening to move a load. An example of this is the biceps brachii muscle contracting when a hand
weight is brought upward with increasing muscle tension. As the biceps brachii contract, the angle of the elbow joint
decreases as the forearm is brought toward the body. Here, the biceps brachii contracts as sarcomeres in its muscle fibers are
shortening and cross-bridges form; the myosin heads pull the actin.
