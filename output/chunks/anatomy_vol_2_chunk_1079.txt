While precise
quantities have not been established, “normal” consumption is not considered harmful to most people, although it may cause
disruptions to sleep and acts as a diuretic. Its consumption by pregnant women is cautioned against, although no evidence
of negative effects has been confirmed. Tolerance and even physical and mental addiction to the drug result in individuals
who routinely consume the substance.

 Nicotine, too, is a stimulant and produces addiction. While legal and nonregulated, concerns about nicotine’s safety
and documented links to respiratory and cardiac disease have resulted in warning labels on cigarette packages.

 Factors Decreasing Heart Rate

HR can be slowed when a person experiences altered sodium and potassium levels, hypoxia, acidosis, alkalosis, and
hypothermia (see Table 19.1). The relationship between electrolytes and HR is complex, but maintaining electrolyte balance
is critical to the normal wave of depolarization. Of the two ions, potassium has the greater clinical significance. Initially,
both hyponatremia (low sodium levels) and hypernatremia (high sodium levels) may lead to tachycardia.
