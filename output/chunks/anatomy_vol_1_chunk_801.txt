This important bony landmark can be felt at your anterolateral hip. Inferior
to the anterior superior iliac spine is a rounded protuberance called the anterior inferior iliac spine. Both of these iliac
spines serve as attachment points for muscles of the thigh. Posteriorly, the iliac crest curves downward to terminate as
the posterior superior iliac spine. Muscles and ligaments surround but do not cover this bony landmark, thus sometimes
producing a depression seen as a “dimple” located on the lower back. More inferiorly is the posterior inferior iliac spine.
 This is located at the inferior end of a large, roughened area called the auricular surface of the ilium. The auricular surface
articulates with the auricular surface of the sacrum to form the sacroiliac joint. Both the posterior superior and posterior
inferior iliac spines serve as attachment points for the muscles and very strong ligaments that support the sacroiliac joint.
 The shallow depression located on the anteromedial (internal) surface of the upper ilium is called the iliac fossa.
