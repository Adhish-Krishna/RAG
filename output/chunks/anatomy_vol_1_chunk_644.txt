The base of the brain case, which forms the floor of cranial cavity, is subdivided into the shallow anterior cranial
fossa, the middle cranial fossa, and the deep posterior cranial fossa.

 The brain case consists of eight bones. These include the paired parietal and temporal bones, plus the unpaired frontal,
occipital, sphenoid, and ethmoid bones.

Parietal Bone

The parietal bone forms most of the upper lateral side of the skull (see Figure 7.5). These are paired bones, with the right
and left parietal bones joining together at the top of the skull. Each parietal bone is also bounded anteriorly by the frontal
bone, inferiorly by the temporal bone, and posteriorly by the occipital bone.

 Temporal Bone

The temporal bone forms the lower lateral side of the skull (see Figure 7.5). Common wisdom has it that the temporal
bone (temporal = “time”) is so named because this area of the head (the temple) is where hair typically first turns gray,
indicating the passage of time.
