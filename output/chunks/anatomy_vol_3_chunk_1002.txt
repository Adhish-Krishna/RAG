The optic
disc in the right eye is on the medial side of the fovea, which would be the left side of the retina. However, the optic disc in the left
eye would be on the right side of that fovea, so the right visual field falls on the side of the retina in the left field where there is
no blind spot. 29 The right leg would feel painful stimuli, but not touch, because the spinothalamic tract decussates at the level of
entry, which would be below the injury, whereas the dorsal column system does not decussate until reaching the brain stem, which
would be above the injury and thus those fibers would be damaged. 30 As the tumor enlarges, it would press against the optic
chiasm, and fibers from the medial retina would be disrupted. These fibers carry information about the lateral visual field because
the visual scene is reversed as the light passes through the pupil and lens.
