Between the two ventricles is a second septum known as the interventricular septum. Unlike the interatrial septum,
the interventricular septum is normally intact after its formation during fetal development. It is substantially thicker than the
interatrial septum, since the ventricles generate far greater pressure when they contract.

 The septum between the atria and ventricles is known as the atrioventricular septum. It is marked by the presence
of four openings that allow blood to move from the atria into the ventricles and from the ventricles into the pulmonary
trunk and aorta. Located in each of these openings between the atria and ventricles is a valve, a specialized structure that
ensures one-way flow of blood. The valves between the atria and ventricles are known generically as atrioventricular
valves. The valves at the openings that lead to the pulmonary trunk and aorta are known generically as semilunar valves.
 The interventricular septum is visible in Figure 19.9. In this figure, the atrioventricular septum has been removed to better
show the bicupid and tricuspid valves; the interatrial septum is not visible, since its location is covered by the aorta and
pulmonary trunk.
