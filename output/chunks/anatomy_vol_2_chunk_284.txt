Spinal nerves are all mixed nerves with both sensory and motor fibers. Spinal nerves emerge from the spinal cord
and reorganize through plexuses, which then give rise to systemic nerves. Thoracic spinal nerves are not part of any plexus,
but give rise to the intercostal nerves directly.

1. Watch this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/
braindevel) to examine the development of the brain,
starting with the neural tube. As the anterior end of the
neural tube develops, it enlarges into the primary vesicles
that establish the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. Those
structures continue to develop throughout the rest of
embryonic development and into adolescence. They are the
basis of the structure of the fully developed adult brain. How

would you describe the difference in the relative sizes of the
three regions of the brain when comparing the early (25th
embryonic day) brain and the adult brain?
