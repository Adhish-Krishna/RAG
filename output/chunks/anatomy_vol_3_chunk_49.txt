Children are especially affected by
second-hand smoke. Children who live with an individual who smokes inside the home have a larger number of lower
respiratory infections, which are associated with hospitalizations, and higher risk of sudden infant death syndrome
(SIDS). Second-hand smoke in the home has also been linked to a greater number of ear infections in children, as well
as worsening symptoms of asthma.
