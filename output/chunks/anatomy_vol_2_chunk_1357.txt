Recognition of Pathogens

Cells of the innate immune response, the phagocytic cells, and the cytotoxic NK cells recognize patterns of pathogen-
specific molecules, such as bacterial cell wall components or bacterial flagellar proteins, using pattern recognition receptors.
 A pattern recognition receptor (PRR) is a membrane-bound receptor that recognizes characteristic features of a pathogen
and molecules released by stressed or damaged cells.

 These receptors, which are thought to have evolved prior to the adaptive immune response, are present on the cell
surface whether they are needed or not. Their variety, however, is limited by two factors. First, the fact that each receptor
type must be encoded by a specific gene requires the cell to allocate most or all of its DNA to make receptors able to
recognize all pathogens. Secondly, the variety of receptors is limited by the finite surface area of the cell membrane. Thus,
the innate immune system must “get by” using only a limited number of receptors that are active against as wide a variety
of pathogens as possible.
