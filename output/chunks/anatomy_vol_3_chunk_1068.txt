34 The timing of this discomfort and bleeding suggests that it is probably caused by implantation
of the blastocyst into the uterine wall. 35 Folate, one of the B vitamins, is important for the healthy formation of the embryonic
neural tube, which occurs in the first few weeks following conceptionâ€”often before a woman even realizes she is pregnant. A
folate-deficient environment increases the risk of a neural tube defect, such as spina bidifa, in the newborn. 36 Circulatory shunts
bypass the fetal lungs and liver, bestowing them with just enough oxygenated blood to fulfill their metabolic requirements. Because
these organs are only semifunctional in the fetus, it is more efficient to bypass them and divert oxygen and nutrients to the organs
that need it more. 37 Premature lungs may not have adequate surfactant, a molecule that reduces surface tension in the lungs
and assists proper lung expansion after birth.
