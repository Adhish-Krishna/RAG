Some factors that are assessed include strength, balance, and
endurance, which are continually monitored as exercises are introduced to track improvements in muscle function.
 Physiotherapists can also instruct patients on the proper use of equipment, such as crutches, and assess whether
someone has sufficient strength to use the equipment and when they can function without it.

CHAPTER 10 | MUSCLE TISSUE

KEY TERMS
ATPase enzyme that hydrolyzes ATP to ADP
acetylcholine (ACh) neurotransmitter that binds at a motor end-plate to trigger depolarization
actin protein that makes up most of the thin myofilaments in a sarcomere muscle fiber

action potential change in voltage of a cell membrane in response to a stimulus that results in transmission of an
electrical signal; unique to neurons and muscle fibers

aerobic respiration production of ATP in the presence of oxygen
angiogenesis formation of blood capillary networks

aponeurosis broad, tendon-like sheet of connective tissue that attaches a skeletal muscle to another skeletal muscle or
to a bone

atrophy loss of structural proteins from muscle fibers
autorhythmicity heartâ€™s ability to control its own contractions
calmodulin regulatory protein that facilitates contraction in smooth muscles

cardiac muscle striated muscle found in the heart; joined to one another at intercalated discs and under the regulation
of pacemaker cells, which contract as one unit to pump blood through the circulatory system.
