Figure 19.8 illustrates the differences in muscular thickness needed for each of the ventricles.

 Left ventricle

Right ventricle

Relaxed Contracted

Figure 19.8 Differences in Ventricular Muscle Thickness The myometrium in the left ventricle is significantly
thicker than that of the right ventricle. Both ventricles pump the same amount of blood, but the left ventricle must
generate a much greater pressure to overcome greater resistance in the systemic circuit. The ventricles are shown
in both relaxed and contracting states. Note the differences in the relative size of the lumens, the region inside each
ventricle where the blood is contained.

 The innermost layer of the heart wall, the endocardium, is joined to the myocardium with a thin layer of connective
tissue. The endocardium lines the chambers where the blood circulates and covers the heart valves. It is made of simple
squamous epithelium called endothelium, which is continuous with the endothelial lining of the blood vessels (see Figure
19.5).
