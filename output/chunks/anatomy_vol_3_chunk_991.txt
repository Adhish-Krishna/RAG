7 A second signal from a separate presynaptic neuron can arrive slightly later, as long as it arrives before
the first one dies off, or dissipates. 8 The action potential depolarizes the cell membrane of the axon terminal, which contains

the voltage-gated Ca** channel. That voltage change opens the channel so that Ca** can enter the axon terminal. Calcium ions
make it possible for synaptic vesicles to release their contents through exocytosis. 9C 10A 11D 12D 13B 14A 15B 16

a treadmill involves contraction of the skeletal muscles in the legs, increase in contraction of the cardiac muscle of the heart, and
the production and secretion of sweat in the skin to stay cool. 35 The sensation of taste associated with eating is sensed by nerves
in the periphery that are involved in sensory and somatic functions.
