Some bitter
molecules depolarize gustatory cells, whereas others hyperpolarize gustatory cells. Likewise, some bitter molecules increase
G protein activation within the gustatory cells, whereas other bitter molecules decrease G protein activation. The specific
response depends on which molecule is binding to the receptor.

 One major group of bitter-tasting molecules are alkaloids. Alkaloids are nitrogen-containing molecules that often
have a basic pH. Alkaloids are commonly found in bitter-tasting plant products, such as coffee, hops (in beer), tannins (in
wine), tea, and aspirin. By containing toxic alkaloids, the plant is less susceptible to microbe infection and less attractive to
herbivores.

 Therefore, the function of bitter taste may primarily be related to stimulating the gag reflex to avoid ingesting poisons.
 Because of this, many bitter foods that are normally ingested are often combined with a sweet component to make them
more palatable (cream and sugar in coffee, for example).
