Between the skin and mucous membranes are connective tissue and
buccinator muscles. The next time you eat some food, notice how the buccinator muscles in your cheeks and the orbicularis
oris muscle in your lips contract, helping you keep the food from falling out of your mouth. Additionally, notice how these
muscles work when you are speaking.
 The pocket-like part of the mouth that is framed on the inside by the gums and teeth, and on the outside by the
cheeks and lips is called the oral vestibule. Moving farther into the mouth, the opening between the oral cavity and throat
(oropharynx) is called the fauces (like the kitchen "faucet"). The main open area of the mouth, or oral cavity proper, runs
from the gums and teeth to the fauces.
 When you are chewing, you do not find it difficult to breathe simultaneously. The next time you have food in your
mouth, notice how the arched shape of the roof of your mouth allows you to handle both digestion and respiration at the
same time.
