In a similar way, without enzymes to catalyze chemical
reactions, the human body would be nonfunctional. It functions only because enzymes function.

 Enzymatic reactions—chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes—begin when substrates bind to the enzyme. A
substrate is a reactant in an enzymatic reaction. This occurs on regions of the enzyme known as active sites (Figure 2.27).
 Any given enzyme catalyzes just one type of chemical reaction. This characteristic, called specificity, is due to the fact that
a substrate with a particular shape and electrical charge can bind only to an active site corresponding to that substrate.

active sites, producing an enzyme-—substrate complex. (c) Changes internal to the enzyme-—substrate complex facilitate

interaction of the substrates.
