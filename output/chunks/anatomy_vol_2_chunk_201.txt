The basal nuclei in the cerebrum are connected with a few more nuclei in the brain stem that together act as a functional
group that forms a motor pathway. Two streams of information processing take place in the basal nuclei. All input to the
basal nuclei is from the cortex into the striatum (Figure 13.10). The direct pathway is the projection of axons from the
striatum to the globus pallidus internal segment (GPi) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). The GPi/SNr then
projects to the thalamus, which projects back to the cortex. The indirect pathway is the projection of axons from the
striatum to the globus pallidus external segment (GPe), then to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and finally to GPi/SNr. The
two streams both target the GPi/SNr, but one has a direct projection and the other goes through a few intervening nuclei.
