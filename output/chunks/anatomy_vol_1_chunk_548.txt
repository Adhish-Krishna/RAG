Simply by looking
at a person, you can see how the bones support, facilitate movement, and protect the human body.

 Just as the steel beams of a building provide a scaffold to support its weight, the bones and cartilage of your skeletal
system compose the scaffold that supports the rest of your body. Without the skeletal system, you would be a limp mass of
organs, muscle, and skin.

 Bones also facilitate movement by serving as points of attachment for your muscles. While some bones only serve as
a support for the muscles, others also transmit the forces produced when your muscles contract. From a mechanical point
of view, bones act as levers and joints serve as fulcrums (Figure 6.2). Unless a muscle spans a joint and contracts, a bone
is not going to move. For information on the interaction of the skeletal and muscular systems, that is, the musculoskeletal
system, seek additional content.
