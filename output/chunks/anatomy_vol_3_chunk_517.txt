A Na*/K*/2CI- symporter in the apical membrane passively allows these ions to enter the cell cytoplasm from the lumen
of the loop down a concentration gradient created by the pump. This mechanism works to dilute the fluid of the ascending
loop ultimately to approximately 50-100 mOsmol/L.

CHAPTER 25 | THE URINARY SYSTEM 1155

At the transition from the DCT to the collecting duct, about 20 percent of the original water is still present and about 10
percent of the sodium. If no other mechanism for water reabsorption existed, about 20-25 liters of urine would be produced.
 Now consider what is happening in the adjacent capillaries, the vasa recta. They are recovering both solutes and water at
a rate that preserves the countercurrent multiplier system. In general, blood flows slowly in capillaries to allow time for
exchange of nutrients and wastes. In the vasa recta particularly, this rate of flow is important for two additional reasons.
