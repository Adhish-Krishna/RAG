It is subdivided into
the facial bones and the brain case, or cranial vault (Figure 7.3). The facial bones underlie the facial structures, form the
nasal cavity, enclose the eyeballs, and support the teeth of the upper and lower jaws. The rounded brain case surrounds and
protects the brain and houses the middle and inner ear structures.

 In the adult, the skull consists of 22 individual bones, 21 of which are immobile and united into a single unit. The 22nd
bone is the mandible (lower jaw), which is the only moveable bone of the skull.
