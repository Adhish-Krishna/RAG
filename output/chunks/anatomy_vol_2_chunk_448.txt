The autonomic nervous system regulates many of the internal organs through a balance of two aspects, or divisions.
 In addition to the endocrine system, the autonomic nervous system is instrumental in homeostatic mechanisms in the body.
 The two divisions of the autonomic nervous system are the sympathetic division and the parasympathetic division. The
sympathetic system is associated with the fight-or-flight response, and parasympathetic activity is referred to by the epithet
of rest and digest. Homeostasis is the balance between the two systems. At each target effector, dual innervation determines
activity. For example, the heart receives connections from both the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. One causes
heart rate to increase, whereas the other causes heart rate to decrease.

response. When someone is said to have a rush of adrenaline, the image of bungee jumpers or skydivers usually comes
to mind.
