Once in the abdominal cavity, an embryo can implant into any well-vascularized structure—the rectouterine cavity
(Douglas’ pouch), the mesentery of the intestines, and the greater omentum are some common sites.

 Tubal pregnancies can be caused by scar tissue within the tube following a sexually transmitted bacterial infection.
 The scar tissue impedes the progress of the embryo into the uterus—in some cases “snagging” the embryo and, in other
cases, blocking the tube completely. Approximately one half of tubal pregnancies resolve spontaneously. Implantation
in a uterine tube causes bleeding, which appears to stimulate smooth muscle contractions and expulsion of the embryo.
 In the remaining cases, medical or surgical intervention is necessary. If an ectopic pregnancy is detected early, the
embryo’s development can be arrested by the administration of the cytotoxic drug methotrexate, which inhibits the
metabolism of folic acid.
