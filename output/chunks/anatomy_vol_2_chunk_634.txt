The differing sensory stimuli are segregated in the
spinal cord so that the various subtests for these stimuli can distinguish which ascending pathway may be damaged in certain
situations.

 670 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM

 Whereas the basic sensory stimuli are assessed in the subtests directed at each submodality of somatosensation, testing
the ability to discriminate sensations is important. Pairing the light touch and pain subtests together makes it possible to
compare the two submodalities at the same time, and therefore the two major ascending tracts at the same time. Mistaking
painful stimuli for light touch, or vice versa, may point to errors in ascending projections, such as in a hemisection of the
spinal cord that might come from a motor vehicle accident.

 Another issue of sensory discrimination is not distinguishing between different submodalities, but rather location. The
two-point discrimination subtest highlights the density of sensory endings, and therefore receptive fields in the skin.
