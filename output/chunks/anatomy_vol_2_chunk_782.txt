This is in turn the initial trigger for insulin
production and secretion by the beta cells of the pancreas. Once nutrient absorption occurs, the resulting surge in blood
glucose levels further stimulates insulin secretion.

 Precisely how insulin facilitates glucose uptake is not entirely clear. However, insulin appears to activate a tyrosine
kinase receptor, triggering the phosphorylation of many substrates within the cell. These multiple biochemical reactions
converge to support the movement of intracellular vesicles containing facilitative glucose transporters to the cell membrane.
 In the absence of insulin, these transport proteins are normally recycled slowly between the cell membrane and cell interior.
 Insulin triggers the rapid movement of a pool of glucose transporter vesicles to the cell membrane, where they fuse and
expose the glucose transporters to the extracellular fluid. The transporters then move glucose by facilitated diffusion into
the cell interior.
