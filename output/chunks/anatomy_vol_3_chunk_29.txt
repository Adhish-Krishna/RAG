Figure 22.7 Larynx The larynx extends from the laryngopharynx and the hyoid bone to the trachea.

 The epiglottis, attached to the thyroid cartilage, is a very flexible piece of elastic cartilage that covers the opening
of the trachea (see Figure 22.4). When in the “closed” position, the unattached end of the epiglottis rests on the glottis.
 The glottis is composed of the vestibular folds, the true vocal cords, and the space between these folds (Figure 22.8). A
vestibular fold, or false vocal cord, is one of a pair of folded sections of mucous membrane. A true vocal cord is one of the
white, membranous folds attached by muscle to the thyroid and arytenoid cartilages of the larynx on their outer edges. The
inner edges of the true vocal cords are free, allowing oscillation to produce sound.
