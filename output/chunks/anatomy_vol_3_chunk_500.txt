Both mechanisms may utilize
concentration gradients maintained by ATP pumps. This is a mechanism described by the term “secondary active transport.”

 For example, a Na” ATPase pump on the basilar membrane of a cell may constantly pump Na” out of a cell, maintaining a
strong electrochemical gradient. On the opposite (apical) surface, a Na*/glucose symport protein channel assists both Na*
and glucose into the cell as Na” moves down the concentration gradient created by the basilar Na’ ATPase pumps. The
glucose molecule then diffuses across the basal membrane by facilitated diffusion into the interstitial space and from there
into peritubular capillaries.

 Most of the Ca**, Na’, glucose, and amino acids must be reabsorbed by the nephron to maintain homeostatic plasma
concentrations. Other substances, such as urea, K’, ammonia (NH3), creatinine, and some drugs are secreted into the filtrate
as waste products.
