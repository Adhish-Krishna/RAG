The Aorta

The aorta is the largest artery in the body (Figure 20.25). It arises from the left ventricle and eventually descends to
the abdominal region, where it bifurcates at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra into the two common iliac arteries.
 The aorta consists of the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and the descending aorta, which passes through the diaphragm
and a landmark that divides into the superior thoracic and inferior abdominal components. Arteries originating from the
aorta ultimately distribute blood to virtually all tissues of the body. At the base of the aorta is the aortic semilunar valve
that prevents backflow of blood into the left ventricle while the heart is relaxing. After exiting the heart, the ascending
aorta moves in a superior direction for approximately 5 cm and ends at the sternal angle. Following this ascent, it reverses
direction, forming a graceful arc to the left, called the aortic arch.
