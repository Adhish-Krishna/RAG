 Methods and Types of Secretion

Exocrine glands can be classified by their mode of secretion and the nature of the substances released, as well as by
the structure of the glands and shape of ducts (Figure 4.10). Merocrine secretion is the most common type of exocrine
secretion. The secretions are enclosed in vesicles that move to the apical surface of the cell where the contents are released
by exocytosis. For example, watery mucous containing the glycoprotein mucin, a lubricant that offers some pathogen
protection is a merocrine secretion. The eccrine glands that produce and secrete sweat are another example.
