The urinary system has roles you may be well aware of: cleansing the blood and ridding the body of wastes probably come
to mind. However, there are additional, equally important functions played by the system. Take for example, regulation of
pH, a function shared with the lungs and the buffers in the blood. Additionally, the regulation of blood pressure is a role
shared with the heart and blood vessels. What about regulating the concentration of solutes in the blood? Did you know that
the kidney is important in determining the concentration of red blood cells? Eighty-five percent of the erythropoietin (EPO)
produced to stimulate red blood cell production is produced in the kidneys. The kidneys also perform the final synthesis
step of vitamin D production, converting calcidiol to calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D.

If the kidneys fail, these functions are compromised or lost altogether, with devastating effects on homeostasis.
