CHAPTER 28 | DEVELOPMENT AND INHERITANCE 1251

Development of the Placenta

During the first several weeks of development, the cells of the endometrium—teferred to as decidual cells—nourish the
nascent embryo. During prenatal weeks 4-12, the developing placenta gradually takes over the role of feeding the embryo,
and the decidual cells are no longer needed. The mature placenta is composed of tissues derived from the embryo, as well
as maternal tissues of the endometrium. The placenta connects to the conceptus via the umbilical cord, which carries
deoxygenated blood and wastes from the fetus through two umbilical arteries; nutrients and oxygen are carried from the
mother to the fetus through the single umbilical vein. The umbilical cord is surrounded by the amnion, and the spaces within
the cord around the blood vessels are filled with Wharton’s jelly, a mucous connective tissue.
