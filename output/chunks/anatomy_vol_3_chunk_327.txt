Figure 24.3 Sources of ATP During catabolic reactions, proteins are broken down into amino acids, lipids are broken
down into fatty acids, and polysaccharides are broken down into monosaccharides. These building blocks are then
used for the synthesis of molecules in anabolic reactions.

 Of the four major macromolecular groups (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids) that are processed
by digestion, carbohydrates are considered the most common source of energy to fuel the body. They take the form
of either complex carbohydrates, polysaccharides like starch and glycogen, or simple sugars (monosaccharides) like
glucose and fructose. Sugar catabolism breaks polysaccharides down into their individual monosaccharides. Among the
monosaccharides, glucose is the most common fuel for ATP production in cells, and as such, there are a number of endocrine
control mechanisms to regulate glucose concentration in the bloodstream.
