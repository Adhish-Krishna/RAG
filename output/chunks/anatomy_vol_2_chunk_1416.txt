An excellent example of this is seroconversion during HIV disease (Figure 21.26). Notice that antibodies are made
early in this disease, and the increase in anti-HIV antibodies correlates with a decrease in detectable virus in the blood.
 Although these antibodies are an important marker for diagnosing the disease, they are not sufficient to completely clear
the virus. Several years later, the vast majority of these individuals, if untreated, will lose their entire adaptive immune
response, including the ability to make antibodies, during the final stages of AIDS.

decline in measurable virus levels, happens during the first several months of HIV disease.
