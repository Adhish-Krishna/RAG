Likewise, the parasympathetic response of rest
reduces the amount of light reaching the retina, allowing the photoreceptors to cycle through bleaching and be regenerated
for further visual perception; this is what the homeostatic process is attempting to maintain.

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/pupillary) to learn about the pupillary reflexes. The pupillary light
reflex involves sensory input through the optic nerve and motor response through the oculomotor nerve to the ciliary
ganglion, which projects to the circular fibers of the iris. As shown in this short animation, pupils will constrict to limit
the amount of light falling on the retina under bright lighting conditions. What constitutes the afferent and efferent
branches of the competing reflex (dilation)?

Autonomic Tone

Organ systems are balanced between the input from the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions.
