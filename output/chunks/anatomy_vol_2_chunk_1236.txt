One of these branches
is the anterior cerebral artery that supplies blood to the frontal lobe of the cerebrum. Another branch, the middle cerebral
artery, supplies blood to the temporal and parietal lobes, which are the most common sites of CVAs. The ophthalmic
artery, the third major branch, provides blood to the eyes.

 The right and left anterior cerebral arteries join together to form an anastomosis called the anterior communicating
artery. The initial segments of the anterior cerebral arteries and the anterior communicating artery form the anterior portion
of the arterial circle. The posterior portion of the arterial circle is formed by a left and a right posterior communicating
artery that branches from the posterior cerebral artery, which arises from the basilar artery. It provides blood to the
posterior portion of the cerebrum and brain stem. The basilar artery is an anastomosis that begins at the junction of the two
vertebral arteries and sends branches to the cerebellum and brain stem.
