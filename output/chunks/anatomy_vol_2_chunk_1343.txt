The spleen also functions as the location of immune responses to
blood-borne pathogens.

Figure 21.9 Spleen (a) The spleen is attached to the stomach. (b) A micrograph of spleen tissue shows the germinal
center. The marginal zone is the region between the red pulp and white pulp, which sequesters particulate antigens
from the circulation and presents these antigens to lymphocytes in the white pulp. EM x 660. (Micrograph provided by

The spleen is also divided by trabeculae of connective tissue, and within each splenic nodule is an area of red pulp,
consisting of mostly red blood cells, and white pulp, which resembles the lymphoid follicles of the lymph nodes.
