These cells contain essentially the same internal structures yet they vary
enormously in shape and function. The different types of cells are not randomly distributed throughout the body; rather they
occur in organized layers, a level of organization referred to as tissue. The micrograph that opens this chapter shows the

high degree of organization among different types of cells in the tissue of the cervix. You can also see how that organization
breaks down when cancer takes over the regular mitotic functioning of a cell.

 The variety in shape reflects the many different roles that cells fulfill in your body. The human body starts as a single
cell at fertilization. As this fertilized egg divides, it gives rise to trillions of cells, each built from the same blueprint, but
organizing into tissues and becoming irreversibly committed to a developmental pathway.
