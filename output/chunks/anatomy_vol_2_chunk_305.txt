Sensory neurons can have either (a) free nerve endings or (b) encapsulated endings. Photoreceptors in the
eyes, such as rod cells, are examples of (c) specialized receptor cells. These cells release neurotransmitters onto a
bipolar cell, which then synapses with the optic nerve neurons.

 Another way that receptors can be classified is based on their location relative to the stimuli. An exteroceptor is a
receptor that is located near a stimulus in the external environment, such as the somatosensory receptors that are located in
the skin. An interoceptor is one that interprets stimuli from internal organs and tissues, such as the receptors that sense the
increase in blood pressure in the aorta or carotid sinus. Finally, a proprioceptor is a receptor located near a moving part of
the body, such as a muscle, that interprets the positions of the tissues as they move.
