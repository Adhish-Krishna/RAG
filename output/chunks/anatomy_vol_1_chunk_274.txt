Cells in a hypertonic solution will shrivel as water leaves the cell via osmosis. In contrast,
a solution that has a lower concentration of solutes than another solution is said to be hypotonic, and water molecules tend
to diffuse out of a hypotonic solution. Cells in a hypotonic solution will take on too much water and swell, with the risk of
eventually bursting. A critical aspect of homeostasis in living things is to create an internal environment in which all of the
body’s cells are in an isotonic solution. Various organ systems, particularly the kidneys, work to maintain this homeostasis.

Figure 3.8 Concentration of Solutions A hypertonic solution has a solute concentration higher than another
solution. An isotonic solution has a solute concentration equal to another solution. A hypotonic solution has a solute
concentration lower than another solution.

 Another mechanism besides diffusion to passively transport materials between compartments is filtration. Unlike
diffusion of a substance from where it is more concentrated to less concentrated, filtration uses a hydrostatic pressure
gradient that pushes the fluid—and the solutes within it—from a higher pressure area to a lower pressure area.
