One example of this is called a bedsore. Bedsores,
also called decubitis ulcers, are caused by constant, long-term, unrelieved pressure on certain body parts that are bony,

reducing blood flow to the area and leading to necrosis (tissue death). Bedsores are most common i

n elderly patients who

have debilitating conditions that cause them to be immobile. Most hospitals and long-term care facilities have the practice of
turning the patients every few hours to prevent the incidence of bedsores. If left untreated by removal of necrotized tissue,

bedsores can be fatal if they become infected.

 The skin can also be affected by pressure associated with rapid growth. A stretch mark results when the dermis is

stretched beyond its limits of elasticity, as the skin stretches to accommodate the excess pressure.
