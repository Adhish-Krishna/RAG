One well-established interaction of the immune, nervous, and endocrine systems is the effect of stress on immune
health. In the human vertebrate evolutionary past, stress was associated with the fight-or-flight response, largely
mediated by the central nervous system and the adrenal medulla. This stress was necessary for survival. The physical
action of fighting or running, whichever the animal decides, usually resolves the problem in one way or another. On
the other hand, there are no physical actions to resolve most modern day stresses, including short-term stressors like
taking examinations and long-term stressors such as being unemployed or losing a spouse. The effect of stress can be
felt by nearly every organ system, and the immune system is no exception (Table 21.10).
