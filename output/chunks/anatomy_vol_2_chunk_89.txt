The career path of a research scientist can be straightforward: college, graduate school, postdoctoral research,
academic research position at a university. A Bachelor’s degree in science will get you started, and for neurophysiology
that might be in biology, psychology, computer science, engineering, or neuroscience. But the real specialization comes
in graduate school. There are many different programs out there to study the nervous system, not just neuroscience
itself. Most graduate programs are doctoral, meaning that a Master’s degree is not part of the work. These are usually
considered five-year programs, with the first two years dedicated to course work and finding a research mentor, and
the last three years dedicated to finding a research topic and pursuing that with a near single-mindedness. The research
will usually result in a few publications in scientific journals, which will make up the bulk of a doctoral dissertation.
