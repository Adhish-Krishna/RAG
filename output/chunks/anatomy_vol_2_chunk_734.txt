Throughout life, gonadotropins regulate
reproductive function and, in the case of women, the onset and cessation of reproductive capacity.

 The gonadotropins include two glycoprotein hormones: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates the
production and maturation of sex cells, or gametes, including ova in women and sperm in men. FSH also promotes follicular
growth; these follicles then release estrogens in the female ovaries. Luteinizing hormone (LH) triggers ovulation in
women, as well as the production of estrogens and progesterone by the ovaries. LH stimulates production of testosterone by
the male testes.

 Prolactin

As its name implies, prolactin (PRL) promotes lactation (milk production) in women. During pregnancy, it contributes to
development of the mammary glands, and after birth, it stimulates the mammary glands to produce breast milk. However,
the effects of prolactin depend heavily upon the permissive effects of estrogens, progesterone, and other hormones.
