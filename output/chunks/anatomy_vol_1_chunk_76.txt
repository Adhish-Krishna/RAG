The extreme muscular
work of labor and delivery are the result of a positive feedback system (Figure 1.11).

Figure 1.11 Positive Feedback Loop Normal childbirth is driven by a positive feedback loop. A positive feedback
loop results in a change in the bodyâ€™s status, rather than a return to homeostasis.

 The first contractions of labor (the stimulus) push the baby toward the cervix (the lowest part of the uterus). The cervix
contains stretch-sensitive nerve cells that monitor the degree of stretching (the sensors). These nerve cells send messages
to the brain, which in turn causes the pituitary gland at the base of the brain to release the hormone oxytocin into the
bloodstream.
