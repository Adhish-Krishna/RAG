The components most critical to emulsification are bile salts and phospholipids, which have a nonpolar
(hydrophobic) region as well as a polar (hydrophilic) region. The hydrophobic region interacts with the large lipid
molecules, whereas the hydrophilic region interacts with the watery chyme in the intestine. This results in the large lipid
globules being pulled apart into many tiny lipid fragments of about 1 ym in diameter. This change dramatically increases
the surface area available for lipid-digesting enzyme activity. This is the same way dish soap works on fats mixed with
water.
 Bile salts act as emulsifying agents, so they are also important for the absorption of digested lipids. While most
constituents of bile are eliminated in feces, bile salts are reclaimed by the enterohepatic circulation. Once bile salts reach
the ileum, they are absorbed and returned to the liver in the hepatic portal blood. The hepatocytes then excrete the bile salts
into newly formed bile. Thus, this precious resource is recycled.
