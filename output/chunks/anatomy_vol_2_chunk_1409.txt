When a different antigen is given for the first time, a new primary
response is made.

 Active versus Passive Immunity

Immunity to pathogens, and the ability to control pathogen growth so that damage to the tissues of the body is limited, can
be acquired by (1) the active development of an immune response in the infected individual or (2) the passive transfer of
immune components from an immune individual to a nonimmune one. Both active and passive immunity have examples in
the natural world and as part of medicine.

 Active immunity is the resistance to pathogens acquired during an adaptive immune response within an individual
(Table 21.6). Naturally acquired active immunity, the response to a pathogen, is the focus of this chapter. Artificially
acquired active immunity involves the use of vaccines. A vaccine is a killed or weakened pathogen or its components
that, when administered to a healthy individual, leads to the development of immunological memory (a weakened primary
immune response) without causing much in the way of symptoms.
