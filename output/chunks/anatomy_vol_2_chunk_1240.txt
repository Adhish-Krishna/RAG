This may sound incongruous—that is, the mixing of systemic arterial blood high in oxygen with the pulmonary
arterial blood lower in oxygen—but the systemic vessels also deliver nutrients to the lung tissue just as they do elsewhere
in the body. The mixed blood drains into typical pulmonary veins, whereas the bronchial artery branches remain separate
and drain into bronchial veins described later. Each pericardial artery supplies blood to the pericardium, the esophageal
artery provides blood to the esophagus, and the mediastinal artery provides blood to the mediastinum. The remaining
thoracic aorta branches are collectively referred to as parietal branches or somatic branches, and include the intercostal
and superior phrenic arteries. Each intercostal artery provides blood to the muscles of the thoracic cavity and vertebral

column. The superior phrenic artery provides blood to the superior surface of the diaphragm. Table 20.7 lists the arteries
of the thoracic region.
