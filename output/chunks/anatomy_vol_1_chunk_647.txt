* Styloid process—Posterior to the mandibular fossa on the external base of the skull is an elongated, downward bony
projection called the styloid process, so named because of its resemblance to a stylus (a pen or writing tool). This
structure serves as an attachment site for several small muscles and for a ligament that supports the hyoid bone of the
neck. (See also Figure 7.7.)

 ¢ Stylomastoid foramen—This small opening is located between the styloid process and mastoid process. This is the
point of exit for the cranial nerve that supplies the facial muscles.

 * Carotid canal—The carotid canal is a zig-zag shaped tunnel that provides passage through the base of the skull for
one of the major arteries that supplies the brain. Its entrance is located on the outside base of the skull, anteromedial to
the styloid process. The canal then runs anteromedially within the bony base of the skull, and then turns upward to its
exit in the floor of the middle cranial cavity, above the foramen lacerum.
