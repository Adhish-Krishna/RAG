Renal Corpuscle

As discussed earlier, the renal corpuscle consists of a tuft of capillaries called the glomerulus that is largely surrounded by
Bowman’s (glomerular) capsule. The glomerulus is a high-pressure capillary bed between afferent and efferent arterioles.
 Bowman’s capsule surrounds the glomerulus to form a lumen, and captures and directs this filtrate to the PCT. The
outermost part of Bowman’s capsule, the parietal layer, is a simple squamous epithelium. It transitions onto the glomerular
capillaries in an intimate embrace to form the visceral layer of the capsule. Here, the cells are not squamous, but uniquely
shaped cells ( podocytes) extending finger-like arms ( pedicels) to cover the glomerular capillaries (Figure 25.11). These
projections interdigitate to form filtration slits, leaving small gaps between the digits to form a sieve. As blood passes
through the glomerulus, 10 to 20 percent of the plasma filters between these sieve-like fingers to be captured by Bowman’s
capsule and funneled to the PCT.
