In the case of the heart, decreasing parasympathetic stimulation decreases the release of ACh, which allows
HR to increase up to approximately 100 bpm. Any increases beyond this rate would require sympathetic stimulation. Figure
19.33 illustrates the effects of parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation on the normal sinus rhythm.
