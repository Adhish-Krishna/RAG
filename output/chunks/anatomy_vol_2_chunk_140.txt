Indirect activation involves a prolonged response, amplified over time

Figure 12.28 Receptor Types (a) An ionotropic receptor is a channel that opens when the neurotransmitter binds
to it. (b) A metabotropic receptor is a complex that causes metabolic changes in the cell when the neurotransmitter
binds to it (1). After binding, the G protein hydrolyzes GTP and moves to the effector protein (2). When the G protein
contacts the effector protein, a second messenger is generated, such as cAMP (3). The second messenger can then
go on to cause changes in the neuron, such as opening or closing ion channels, metabolic changes, and changes in
gene transcription.
