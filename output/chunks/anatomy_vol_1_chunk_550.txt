While the origin of the word “orthopedics” (ortho- = “straight”; paed- = “child”), literally means “straightening
of the child,” orthopedists can have patients who range from pediatric to geriatric. In recent years, orthopedists have
even performed prenatal surgery to correct spina bifida, a congenital defect in which the neural canal in the spine of
the fetus fails to close completely during embryologic development.

 Orthopedists commonly treat bone and joint injuries but they also treat other bone conditions including curvature
of the spine. Lateral curvatures (scoliosis) can be severe enough to slip under the shoulder blade (scapula) forcing
it up as a hump. Spinal curvatures can also be excessive dorsoventrally (kyphosis) causing a hunch back and
thoracic compression.
