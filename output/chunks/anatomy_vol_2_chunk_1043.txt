In the third-
degree or complete block, there is no correlation between atrial activity (the P wave) and ventricular activity (the QRS
complex). Even in the event of a total SA block, the AV node will assume the role of pacemaker and continue initiating
contractions at 40-60 contractions per minute, which is adequate to maintain consciousness. Second- and third-degree
blocks are demonstrated on the ECG presented in Figure 19.25.

 When arrhythmias become a chronic problem, the heart maintains a junctional rhythm, which originates in the
AV node. In order to speed up the heart rate and restore full sinus rhythm, a cardiologist can implant an artificial
pacemaker, which delivers electrical impulses to the heart muscle to ensure that the heart continues to contract and pump
blood effectively. These artificial pacemakers are programmable by the cardiologists and can either provide stimulation
temporarily upon demand or on a continuous basis.
