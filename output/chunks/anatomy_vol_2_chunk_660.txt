Ataxia is often the result of exposure to exogenous substances, focal lesions, or a genetic disorder. Focal lesions
include strokes affecting the cerebellar arteries, tumors that may impinge on the cerebellum, trauma to the back of the
head and neck, or MS. Alcohol intoxication or drugs such as ketamine cause ataxia, but it is often reversible. Mercury in
fish can cause ataxia as well. Hereditary conditions can lead to degeneration of the cerebellum or spinal cord, as well as
malformation of the brain, or the abnormal accumulation of copper seen in Wilson’s disease.

Watch this short video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/stationtest) to see a test for station. Station refers to the position
a person adopts when they are standing still. The examiner would look for issues with balance, which coordinates
proprioceptive, vestibular, and visual information in the cerebellum. To test the ability of a subject to maintain balance,
asking them to stand or hop on one foot can be more demanding.
