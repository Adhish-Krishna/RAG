Responses also include the neural control of
glands in the body as well, such as the production and secretion of sweat by the eccrine and merocrine sweat glands found
in the skin to lower body temperature.

 Responses can be divided into those that are voluntary or conscious (contraction of skeletal muscle) and those that are
involuntary (contraction of smooth muscles, regulation of cardiac muscle, activation of glands). Voluntary responses are
governed by the somatic nervous system and involuntary responses are governed by the autonomic nervous system, which
are discussed in the next section.

 Integration. Stimuli that are received by sensory structures are communicated to the nervous system where that
information is processed. This is called integration. Stimuli are compared with, or integrated with, other stimuli, memories
of previous stimuli, or the state of a person at a particular time. This leads to the specific response that will be generated.
 Seeing a baseball pitched to a batter will not automatically cause the batter to swing.
