Peptide hormones consist of short chains of amino acids, whereas protein
hormones are longer polypeptides. Both types are synthesized like other body proteins: DNA is transcribed into mRNA,
which is translated into an amino acid chain.

 Examples of peptide hormones include antidiuretic hormone (ADH), a pituitary hormone important in fluid balance,
and atrial-natriuretic peptide, which is produced by the heart and helps to decrease blood pressure. Some examples of
protein hormones include growth hormone, which is produced by the pituitary gland, and follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH), which has an attached carbohydrate group and is thus classified as a glycoprotein. FSH helps stimulate the
maturation of eggs in the ovaries and sperm in the testes.

 Steroid Hormones

The primary hormones derived from lipids are steroids. Steroid hormones are derived from the lipid cholesterol. For
example, the reproductive hormones testosterone and the estrogens—which are produced by the gonads (testes and
ovaries)—are steroid hormones.
