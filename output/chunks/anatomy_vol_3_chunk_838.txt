The downward pressure of the uterus also compresses the urinary bladder, leading to frequent urination. The problem
is exacerbated by increased urine production. In addition, the maternal urinary system processes both maternal and fetal
wastes, further increasing the total volume of urine.

Circulatory System Changes

Blood volume increases substantially during pregnancy, so that by childbirth, it exceeds its preconception volume by 30
percent, or approximately 1-2 liters. The greater blood volume helps to manage the demands of fetal nourishment and
fetal waste removal. In conjunction with increased blood volume, the pulse and blood pressure also rise moderately during
pregnancy. As the fetus grows, the uterus compresses underlying pelvic blood vessels, hampering venous return from the
legs and pelvic region. As a result, many pregnant women develop varicose veins or hemorrhoids.

 Respiratory System Changes

During the second half of pregnancy, the respiratory minute volume (volume of gas inhaled or exhaled by the lungs per
minute) increases by 50 percent to compensate for the oxygen demands of the fetus and the increased maternal metabolic
rate.
