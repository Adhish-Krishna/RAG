Figure 1.2 Gross and Microscopic Anatomy (a) Gross anatomy considers large structures such as the brain. (b)
Microscopic anatomy can deal with the same structures, though at a different scale. This is a micrograph of nerve
cells from the brain. LM x 1600. (credit a: “WriterHound”/Wikimedia Commons; credit b: Micrograph provided by the

Anatomists take two general approaches to the study of the body’s structures: regional and systemic. Regional
anatomy is the study of the interrelationships of all of the structures in a specific body region, such as the abdomen.
 Studying regional anatomy helps us appreciate the interrelationships of body structures, such as how muscles, nerves, blood
vessels, and other structures work together to serve a particular body region. In contrast, systemic anatomy is the study of
the structures that make up a discrete body system—that is, a group of structures that work together to perform a unique
body function.
