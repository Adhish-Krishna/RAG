¢ Identify the four main types of secreting cells in gastric glands, and their important products
¢ Explain why the stomach does not digest itself
 ¢ Describe the mechanical and chemical digestion of food entering the stomach

 Although a minimal amount of carbohydrate digestion occurs in the mouth, chemical digestion really gets underway in
the stomach. An expansion of the alimentary canal that lies immediately inferior to the esophagus, the stomach links the
esophagus to the first part of the small intestine (the duodenum) and is relatively fixed in place at its esophageal and
duodenal ends. In between, however, it can be a highly active structure, contracting and continually changing position and
size. These contractions provide mechanical assistance to digestion. The empty stomach is only about the size of your fist,
but can stretch to hold as much as 4 liters of food and fluid, or more than 75 times its empty volume, and then return to
its resting size when empty.
