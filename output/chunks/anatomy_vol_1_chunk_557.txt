6.3 | Bone Structure

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

¢ Identify the anatomical features of a bone

¢ Define and list examples of bone markings

* Describe the histology of bone tissue

¢ Compare and contrast compact and spongy bone

¢ Identify the structures that compose compact and spongy bone

¢ Describe how bones are nourished and innervated

Bone tissue (osseous tissue) differs greatly from other tissues in the body. Bone is hard and many of its functions depend on
that characteristic hardness. Later discussions in this chapter will show that bone is also dynamic in that its shape adjusts to
accommodate stresses.
