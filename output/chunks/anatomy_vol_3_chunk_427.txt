Any excess is stored for later
fasting stages. As blood glucose levels rise, the pancreas releases insulin to stimulate the uptake of glucose by hepatocytes
in the liver, muscle cells/fibers, and adipocytes (fat cells), and to promote its conversion to glycogen. As the postabsorptive
state begins, glucose levels drop, and there is a corresponding drop in insulin levels. Falling glucose levels trigger the
pancreas to release glucagon to turn off glycogen synthesis in the liver and stimulate its breakdown into glucose. The
glucose is released into the bloodstream to serve as a fuel source for cells throughout the body. If glycogen stores are
depleted during fasting, alternative sources, including fatty acids and proteins, can be metabolized and used as fuel. When
the body once again enters the absorptive state after fasting, fats and proteins are digested and used to replenish fat
and protein stores, whereas glucose is processed and used first to replenish the glycogen stores in the peripheral tissues,
then in the liver.
