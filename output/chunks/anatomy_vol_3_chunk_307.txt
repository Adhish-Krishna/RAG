The stomach begins the
digestion of protein and continues the digestion of carbohydrates and fats. It stores food as an acidic liquid called chyme,
and releases it gradually into the small intestine through the pyloric sphincter.

 23.5 The Small and Large Intestines

The three main regions of the small intestine are the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. The small intestine is where
digestion is completed and virtually all absorption occurs. These two activities are facilitated by structural adaptations that
increase the mucosal surface area by 600-fold, including circular folds, villi, and microvilli. There are around 200 million
microvilli per square millimeter of small intestine, which contain brush border enzymes that complete the digestion of
carbohydrates and proteins. Combined with pancreatic juice, intestinal juice provides the liquid medium needed to further
digest and absorb substances from chyme. The small intestine is also the site of unique mechanical digestive movements.
 Segmentation moves the chyme back and forth, increasing mixing and opportunities for absorption.
