The highest concentration of bitter receptors appear to be in the
posterior tongue, where a gag reflex could still spit out poisonous food.

 The taste known as umami is often referred to as the savory taste. Like sweet and bitter, it is based on the activation of
G protein-coupled receptors by a specific molecule. The molecule that activates this receptor is the amino acid L-glutamate.
 Therefore, the umami flavor is often perceived while eating protein-rich foods. Not surprisingly, dishes that contain meat
are often described as savory.

 Once the gustatory cells are activated by the taste molecules, they release neurotransmitters onto the dendrites of
sensory neurons. These neurons are part of the facial and glossopharyngeal cranial nerves, as well as a component within
the vagus nerve dedicated to the gag reflex. The facial nerve connects to taste buds in the anterior third of the tongue. The
glossopharyngeal nerve connects to taste buds in the posterior two thirds of the tongue.
