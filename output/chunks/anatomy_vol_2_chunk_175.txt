Whereas prosencephalon and mesencephalon
translate into the English words forebrain and midbrain, there is not a word for “four-sided-figure-brain.” However, the
third vesicle can be called the hindbrain. One way of thinking about how the brain is arranged is to use these three

regions—forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain—which are based on the primary vesicle stage of development (Figure 13.3a).

 Secondary Vesicles

The brain continues to develop, and the vesicles differentiate further (see Figure 13.3b). The three primary vesicles
become five secondary vesicles. The prosencephalon enlarges into two new vesicles called the telencephalon and the
diencephalon. The telecephalon will become the cerebrum. The diencephalon gives rise to several adult structures; two that
will be important are the thalamus and the hypothalamus. In the embryonic diencephalon, a structure known as the eye cup
develops, which will eventually become the retina, the nervous tissue of the eye called the retina.
