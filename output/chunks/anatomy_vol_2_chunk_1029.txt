Since the SA node is the pacemaker, it
reaches threshold faster than any other component of the conduction system. It will initiate the impulses spreading to the

other conducting cells. The SA node, without nervous or endocrine control, would initiate a heart impulse approximately
80-100 times per minute. Although each component of the conduction system is capable of generating its own impulse,
the rate progressively slows as you proceed from the SA node to the Purkinje fibers. Without the SA node, the AV node
would generate a heart rate of 40-60 beats per minute. If the AV node were blocked, the atrioventricular bundle would fire
at a rate of approximately 30-40 impulses per minute. The bundle branches would have an inherent rate of 20-30 impulses
per minute, and the Purkinje fibers would fire at 15-20 impulses per minute.
