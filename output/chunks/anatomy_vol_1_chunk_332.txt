A somatic cell is a general term for a body cell, and all human cells, except for
the cells that produce eggs and sperm (which are referred to as germ cells), are somatic cells. Somatic cells contain two
copies of each of their chromosomes (one copy received from each parent). A homologous pair of chromosomes is the two

copies of a single chromosome found in each somatic cell. The human is a diploid organism, having 23 homologous pairs
of chromosomes in each of the somatic cells. The condition of having pairs of chromosomes is known as diploidy.

 Cells in the body replace themselves over the lifetime of a person. For example, the cells lining the gastrointestinal
tract must be frequently replaced when constantly “worn off” by the movement of food through the gut. But what triggers
a cell to divide, and how does it prepare for and complete cell division?
