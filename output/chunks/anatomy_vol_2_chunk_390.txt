Monocular depth cues are those that are the result of information
within the two-dimensional visual field. One object that overlaps another object has to be in front. Relative size
differences are also a cue. For example, if a basketball appears larger than the basket, then the basket must be
further away. On the basis of experience, we can estimate how far away the basket is. Binocular depth cues compare
information represented in the two retinae because they do not see the visual field exactly the same.

 The centers of the two eyes are separated by a small distance, which is approximately 6 to 6.5 cm in most people.
 Because of this offset, visual stimuli do not fall on exactly the same spot on both retinae unless we are fixated directly
on them and they fall on the fovea of each retina. All other objects in the visual field, either closer or farther away than
the fixated object, will fall on different spots on the retina.
