The carrying
angle is larger in females to accommodate their wider pelvis.

 Radius

The radius runs parallel to the ulna, on the lateral (thumb) side of the forearm (see Figure 8.6). The head of the radius
is a disc-shaped structure that forms the proximal end. The small depression on the surface of the head articulates with the
capitulum of the humerus as part of the elbow joint, whereas the smooth, outer margin of the head articulates with the radial
notch of the ulna at the proximal radioulnar joint. The neck of the radius is the narrowed region immediately below the
expanded head. Inferior to this point on the medial side is the radial tuberosity, an oval-shaped, bony protuberance that
serves as a muscle attachment point. The shaft of the radius is slightly curved and has a small ridge along its medial side.
 This ridge forms the interosseous border of the radius, which, like the similar border of the ulna, is the line of attachment
for the interosseous membrane that unites the two forearm bones.
