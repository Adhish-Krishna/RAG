The six types of synovial joints allow the body to move in a variety of ways. (a)
Pivot joints allow for rotation around an axis, such as between the first and second cervical vertebrae, which allows for
side-to-side rotation of the head. (b) The hinge joint of the elbow works like a door hinge. (c) The articulation between
the trapezium carpal bone and the first metacarpal bone at the base of the thumb is a saddle joint. (d) Plane joints, such
as those between the tarsal bones of the foot, allow for limited gliding movements between bones. (e) The radiocarpal
joint of the wrist is a condyloid joint. (f) The hip and shoulder joints are the only ball-and-socket joints of the body.

 Pivot Joint

Ata pivot joint, a rounded portion of a bone is enclosed within a ring formed partially by the articulation with another bone
and partially by a ligament (see Figure 9.10a).
