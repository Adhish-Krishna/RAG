karyotype systematic arrangement of images of chromosomes into homologous pairs

lactation process by which milk is synthesized and secreted from the mammary glands of the postpartum female breast
in response to sucking at the nipple

lanugo silk-like hairs that coat the fetus; shed later in fetal development
let-down reflex release of milk from the alveoli triggered by infant suckling
lightening descent of the fetus lower into the pelvis in late pregnancy; also called “dropping”

lochia postpartum vaginal discharge that begins as blood and ends as a whitish discharge; the end of lochia signals that
the site of placental attachment has healed

meconium fetal wastes consisting of ingested amniotic fluid, cellular debris, mucus, and bile

mesoderm primary germ layer that becomes the skeleton, muscles, connective tissue, heart, blood vessels, and kidneys
morula tightly packed sphere of blastomeres that has reached the uterus but has not yet implanted itself

mutation change in the nucleotide sequence of DNA

neural fold elevated edge of the neural groove

neural plate thickened layer of neuroepithelium that runs longitudinally along the dorsal surface of an embryo and
gives rise to nervous system tissue

neural tube precursor to structures of the central nervous system, formed by the invagination and separation of
neuroepithelium

neurulation embryonic process that establishes the central nervous system

nonshivering thermogenesis process of breaking down brown adipose tissue to produce heat in the absence of a
shivering response

notochord rod-shaped, mesoderm-derived structure that provides support for growing fetus
organogenesis development of the rudimentary structures of all of an embryo’s organs from the germ layers

Punnett square grid used to display all possible combinations of alleles transmitted by parents to offspring and predict
the mathematical probability of offspring inheriting a given genotype

parturition childbirth
phenotype physical or biochemical manifestation of the genotype; expression of the alleles

placenta previa low placement of fetus within uterus causes placenta to partially or completely cover the opening of
the cervix as it grows

placenta organ that forms during pregnancy to nourish the developing fetus; also regulates waste and gas exchange
between mother and fetus

placentation formation of the placenta; complete by weeks 14-16 of pregnancy
polyspermy penetration of an oocyte by more than one sperm
primitive streak indentation along the dorsal surface of the epiblast through which cells migrate to form the endoderm

and mesoderm during gastrulation

CHAPTER 28 | DEVELOPMENT AND INHERITANCE 1283

prolactin pituitary hormone that establishes and maintains the supply of breast milk; also important for the mobilization
of maternal micronutrients for breast milk

quickening fetal movements that are strong enough to be felt by the mother

recessive lethal inheritance pattern in which individuals with two copies of a lethal allele do not survive in utero or
have a shortened life span

recessive describes a trait that is only expressed in homozygous form and is masked in heterozygous form

sex chromosomes pair of chromosomes involved in sex determination; in males, the XY chromosomes; in females,
the XX chromosomes

shunt circulatory shortcut that diverts the flow of blood from one region to another
somite one of the paired, repeating blocks of tissue located on either side of the notochord in the early embryo

syncytiotrophoblast superficial cells of the trophoblast that fuse to form a multinucleated body that digests
endometrial cells to firmly secure the blastocyst to the uterine wall

trait variation of an expressed characteristic
trimester division of the duration of a pregnancy into three 3-month terms

trophoblast fluid-filled shell of squamous cells destined to become the chorionic villi, placenta, and associated fetal
membranes

true labor regular contractions that immediately precede childbirth; they do not abate with hydration or rest, and they
become more frequent and powerful with time

umbilical cord connection between the developing conceptus and the placenta; carries deoxygenated blood and wastes
from the fetus and returns nutrients and oxygen from the mother

vernix caseosa waxy, cheese-like substance that protects the delicate fetal skin until birth

X-linked dominant pattern of dominant inheritance that corresponds to a gene on the X chromosome of the 23rd pair
X-linked recessive pattern of recessive inheritance that corresponds to a gene on the X chromosome of the 23rd pair
X-linked pattern of inheritance in which an allele is carried on the X chromosome of the 23rd pair

yolk sac membrane associated with primitive circulation to the developing embryo; source of the first blood cells and
germ cells and contributes to the umbilical cord structure

zona pellucida thick, gel-like glycoprotein membrane that coats the oocyte and must be penetrated by sperm before
fertilization can occur

zygote fertilized egg; a diploid cell resulting from the fertilization of haploid gametes from the male and female lines

CHAPTER REVIEW

28.1 Fertilization

Hundreds of millions of sperm deposited in the vagina travel toward the oocyte, but only a few hundred actually reach
it.
