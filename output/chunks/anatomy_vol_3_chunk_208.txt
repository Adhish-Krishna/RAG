This epithelium protects against erosion from food particles. The
mucosa’s lamina propria contains mucus-secreting glands. The muscularis layer changes according to location: In the upper
third of the esophagus, the muscularis is skeletal muscle. In the middle third, it is both skeletal and smooth muscle. In
the lower third, it is smooth muscle. As mentioned previously, the most superficial layer of the esophagus is called the
adventitia, not the serosa. In contrast to the stomach and intestines, the loose connective tissue of the adventitia is not
covered by a fold of visceral peritoneum. The digestive functions of the esophagus are identified in Table 23.5.

CHAPTER 23 | THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 1039

Digestive Functions of the Esophagus

Action Outcome
Upper esophageal
sphincter relaxation Allows the bolus to move from the laryngopharynx to the esophagus
Peristalsis Propels the bolus through the esophagus
Lower esophageal Allows the bolus to move from the esophagus into the stomach and prevents
sphincter relaxation chime from entering the esophagus
Mucus secretion Lubricates the esophagus, allowing easy passage of the bolus

Deglutition

Deglutition is another word for swallowing—the movement of food from the mouth to the stomach.
