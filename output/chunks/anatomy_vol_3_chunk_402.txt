The convection currents created by the temperature changes continue to draw heat away from the body
more quickly than the body can replace it, resulting in hyperthermia. About 15 percent of the bodyâ€™s heat is lost through
convection.

 Radiation is the transfer of heat via infrared waves. This occurs between any two objects when their temperatures
differ. A radiator can warm a room via radiant heat. On a sunny day, the radiation from the sun warms the skin. The same
principle works from the body to the environment. About 60 percent of the heat lost by the body is lost through radiation.

 Evaporation is the transfer of heat by the evaporation of water. Because it takes a great deal of energy for a water
molecule to change from a liquid to a gas, evaporating water (in the form of sweat) takes with it a great deal of energy
from the skin.
