The most likely explanation is that he has suffered a stroke, which has caused a loss of oxygen to a particular part of

the central nervous system (CNS). The problem is finding where in the entire nervous system the stroke has occurred. By
checking reflexes, sensory responses, and motor control, a health care provider can focus on what abilities the patient may
have lost as a result of the stroke and can use this information to determine where the injury occurred. In the emergency
department of the hospital, this kind of rapid assessment of neurological function is key to treating trauma to the nervous
system. In the classroom, the neurological exam is a valuable tool for learning the anatomy and physiology of the nervous
system because it allows you to relate the functions of the system to particular locations in the nervous system.
