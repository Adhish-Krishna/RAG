These preganglionic fibers release ACh, which excites the ganglionic neuron through the nicotinic receptor. The axon from
the ganglionic neuron—the postganglionic fiber—then projects to a target effector where it will release norepinephrine
to bind to an adrenergic receptor, causing a change in the physiology of that organ in keeping with the broad, divergent
sympathetic response. The postganglionic connections to sweat glands in the skin and blood vessels supplying skeletal
muscle are, however, exceptions; those fibers release ACh onto muscarinic receptors. The sympathetic system has a
specialized preganglionic connection to the adrenal medulla that causes epinephrine and norepinephrine to be released into
the bloodstream rather than exciting a neuron that contacts an organ directly. This hormonal component means that the
sympathetic chemical signal can spread throughout the body very quickly and affect many organ systems at once.

 The parasympathetic output is based in the brain stem and sacral spinal cord. Neurons from particular nuclei in the
brain stem or from the lateral horn of the sacral spinal cord (preganglionic neurons) project to terminal (intramural) ganglia
located close to or within the wall of target effectors.
