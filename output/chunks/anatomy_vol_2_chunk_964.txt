This
complex swirling pattern allows the heart to pump blood more effectively than a simple linear pattern would. Figure 19.7
illustrates the arrangement of muscle cells.

Figure 19.7 Heart Musculature The swirling pattern of cardiac muscle tissue contributes significantly to the heartâ€™s
ability to pump blood effectively.

 Although the ventricles on the right and left sides pump the same amount of blood per contraction, the muscle of the
left ventricle is much thicker and better developed than that of the right ventricle. In order to overcome the high resistance
required to pump blood into the long systemic circuit, the left ventricle must generate a great amount of pressure. The right
ventricle does not need to generate as much pressure, since the pulmonary circuit is shorter and provides less resistance.
