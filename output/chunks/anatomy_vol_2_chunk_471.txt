Signaling molecules can belong to two broad groups. Neurotransmitters are released at synapses, whereas hormones
are released into the bloodstream. These are simplistic definitions, but they can help to clarify this point. Acetylcholine can
be considered a neurotransmitter because it is released by axons at synapses. The adrenergic system, however, presents a
challenge. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers release norepinephrine, which can be considered a neurotransmitter. But the
adrenal medulla releases epinephrine and norepinephrine into circulation, so they should be considered hormones.

 What are referred to here as synapses may not fit the strictest definition of synapse. Some sources will refer to the
connection between a postganglionic fiber and a target effector as neuroeffector junctions; neurotransmitters, as defined
above, would be called neuromodulators. The structure of postganglionic connections are not the typical synaptic end bulb
that is found at the neuromuscular junction, but rather are chains of swellings along the length of a postganglionic fiber
called a varicosity (Figure 15.5).
