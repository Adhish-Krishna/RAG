A phospholipid molecule consists of a polar phosphate “head,” which is
hydrophilic and a non-polar lipid “tail,” which is hydrophobic. Unsaturated fatty acids result in kinks in the hydrophobic
tails.

 The cell membrane consists of two adjacent layers of phospholipids. The lipid tails of one layer face the lipid tails
of the other layer, meeting at the interface of the two layers. The phospholipid heads face outward, one layer exposed to
the interior of the cell and one layer exposed to the exterior (Figure 3.3). Because the phosphate groups are polar and
hydrophilic, they are attracted to water in the intracellular fluid. Intracellular fluid (ICF) is the fluid interior of the cell. The
phosphate groups are also attracted to the extracellular fluid. Extracellular fluid (ECF) is the fluid environment outside
the enclosure of the cell membrane. Interstitial fluid (IF) is the term given to extracellular fluid not contained within
blood vessels.
