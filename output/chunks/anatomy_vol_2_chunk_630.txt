Somatic
senses are incorporated mostly into the skin, muscles, or tendons, whereas the visceral senses come from nervous tissue
incorporated into the majority of organs such as the heart or stomach. The somatic senses are those that usually make up
the conscious perception of the how the body interacts with the environment. The visceral senses are most often below the
limit of conscious perception because they are involved in homeostatic regulation through the autonomic nervous system.

 The sensory exam tests the somatic senses, meaning those that are consciously perceived. Testing of the senses begins
with examining the regions known as dermatomes that connect to the cortical region where somatosensation is perceived
in the postcentral gyrus. To test the sensory fields, a simple stimulus of the light touch of the soft end of a cotton-tipped
applicator is applied at various locations on the skin. The spinal nerves, which contain sensory fibers with dendritic endings
in the skin, connect with the skin in a topographically organized manner, illustrated as dermatomes (Figure 16.13).
