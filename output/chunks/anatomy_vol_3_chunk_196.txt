The parotid glands are the usual site of
infection with the virus that causes mumps (paramyxovirus). Mumps manifests by enlargement and inflammation of
the parotid glands, causing a characteristic swelling between the ears and the jaw. Symptoms include fever and throat
pain, which can be severe when swallowing acidic substances such as orange juice.

 In about one-third of men who are past puberty, mumps also causes testicular inflammation, typically affecting
only one testis and rarely resulting in sterility. With the increasing use and effectiveness of mumps vaccines, the
incidence of mumps has decreased dramatically. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), the number of mumps cases dropped from more than 150,000 in 1968 to fewer than 1700 in 1993 to only 11
reported cases in 2011.

 Regulation of Salivation

The autonomic nervous system regulates salivation (the secretion of saliva). In the absence of food, parasympathetic
stimulation keeps saliva flowing at just the right level for comfort as you speak, swallow, sleep, and generally go about life.
