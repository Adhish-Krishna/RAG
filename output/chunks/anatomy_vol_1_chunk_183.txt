(a) Dehydration synthesis

Monomers are joined by removal of OH from one monomer and removal of H from the other at the site of bond formation.

Monomers linked by covalent bond

(b) Hydrolysis

Monomers are released by the addition of a water molecule, adding OH to one monomer and H to the other.

Figure 2.14 Dehydration Synthesis and Hydrolysis Monomers, the basic units for building larger molecules, form
polymers (two or more chemically-bonded monomers). (a) In dehydration synthesis, two monomers are covalently
bonded in a reaction in which one gives up a hydroxyl group and the other a hydrogen atom. A molecule of water is
released as a byproduct during dehydration reactions. (b) In hydrolysis, the covalent bond between two monomers is
split by the addition of a hydrogen atom to one and a hydroxyl group to the other, which requires the contribution of
one molecule of water.
