Other superficial
reflexes are not commonly tested, though a series of abdominal reflexes can target function in the lower thoracic spinal
segments.

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/reflextest) to see how to test reflexes in the abdomen. Testing reflexes
of the trunk is not commonly performed in the neurological exam, but if findings suggest a problem with the thoracic
segments of the spinal cord, a series of superficial reflexes of the abdomen can localize function to those segments. If
contraction is not observed when the skin lateral to the umbilicus (belly button) is stimulated, what level of the spinal
cord may be damaged?

 Comparison of Upper and Lower Motor Neuron Damage

Many of the tests of motor function can indicate differences that will address whether damage to the motor system is
in the upper or lower motor neurons.
