In this case, the patient’s condition will deteriorate dramatically and rapidly, and immediate surgical
intervention may be required.

 Auscultation, or listening to a patient’s heart sounds, is one of the most useful diagnostic tools, since it is proven,
safe, and inexpensive. The term auscultation is derived from the Latin for “to listen,” and the technique has been used
for diagnostic purposes as far back as the ancient Egyptians. Valve and septal disorders will trigger abnormal heart
sounds. If a valvular disorder is detected or suspected, a test called an echocardiogram, or simply an “echo,” may be
ordered. Echocardiograms are sonograms of the heart and can help in the diagnosis of valve disorders as well as a wide
variety of heart pathologies.
