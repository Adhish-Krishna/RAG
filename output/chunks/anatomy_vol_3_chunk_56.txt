Since the parietal pleura is attached to the thoracic wall, the natural elasticity of the chest wall opposes the inward pull
of the lungs. Ultimately, the outward pull is slightly greater than the inward pull, creating the -4 mm Hg intrapleura!
pressure relative to the intra-alveolar pressure. Transpulmonary pressure is the difference between the intrapleural and
intra-alveolar pressures, and it determines the size of the lungs. A higher transpulmonary pressure corresponds to a larger
lung.

 Physical Factors Affecting Ventilation

 In addition to the differences in pressures, breathing is also dependent upon the contraction and relaxation of muscle fibers
of both the diaphragm and thorax. The lungs themselves are passive during breathing, meaning they are not involved in
creating the movement that helps inspiration and expiration. This is because of the adhesive nature of the pleural fluid,
which allows the lungs to be pulled outward when the thoracic wall moves during inspiration.
