10 The structures that stabilize the elbow include the
coronoid process, the radial (lateral) collateral ligament, and the anterior portion of the ulnar (medial) collateral ligament. 11 The
articular cartilage functions to absorb shock and to provide an extremely smooth surface that makes movement between bones
easy, without damaging the bones. 12 An intracapsular fracture of the neck of the femur can result in disruption of the arterial
blood supply to the head of the femur, which may lead to avascular necrosis of the femoral head. 13 The articular cartilage
is thickest in the upper and back part of the acetabulum, the socket portion of the hip joint. These regions receive most of the
force from the head of the femur during walking and running. 14 There are five ligaments associated with the knee joint. The
tibial collateral ligament is located on the medial side of the knee and the fibular collateral ligament is located on the lateral
side.
