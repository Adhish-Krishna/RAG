This causes
inflammation and the destruction of the myelin in the central nervous system. As the insulation around the axons is
destroyed by the disease, scarring becomes obvious. This is where the name of the disease comes from; sclerosis means
hardening of tissue, which is what a scar is. Multiple scars are found in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord.
 The symptoms of MS include both somatic and autonomic deficits. Control of the musculature is compromised, as is
control of organs such as the bladder.

 Guillain-Barr√© (pronounced gee-YAN bah-RAY) syndrome is an example of a demyelinating disease of the
peripheral nervous system. It is also the result of an autoimmune reaction, but the inflammation is in peripheral nerves.
 Sensory symptoms or motor deficits are common, and autonomic failures can lead to changes in the heart rhythm or a
drop in blood pressure, especially when standing, which causes dizziness.
