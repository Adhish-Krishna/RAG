The frontal lobe is responsible for
motor functions, from planning movements through executing commands to be sent to the spinal cord and periphery. The
most anterior portion of the frontal lobe is the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with aspects of personality through its
influence on motor responses in decision-making.

 The other lobes are responsible for sensory functions. The parietal lobe is where somatosensation is processed. The
occipital lobe is where visual processing begins, although the other parts of the brain can contribute to visual function. The
temporal lobe contains the cortical area for auditory processing, but also has regions crucial for memory formation.

 Nuclei beneath the cerebral cortex, known as the subcortical nuclei, are responsible for augmenting cortical functions.
 The basal nuclei receive input from cortical areas and compare it with the general state of the individual through the activity
of a dopamine-releasing nucleus.
