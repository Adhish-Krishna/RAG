This reflex is similar to the somatic reflex, but the
efferent branch is composed of two neurons. The central neuron projects from the spinal cord or brain stem to synapse on
the ganglionic neuron that projects to the effector. The afferent branch of the somatic and visceral reflexes is very similar, as
many somatic and special senses activate autonomic responses. However, there are visceral senses that do not form part of
conscious perception. If a visceral sensation, such as cardiac pain, is strong enough, it will rise to the level of consciousness.
 However, the sensory homunculus does not provide a representation of the internal structures to the same degree as the
surface of the body, so visceral sensations are often experienced as referred pain, such as feelings of pain in the left shoulder
and arm in connection with a heart attack.
