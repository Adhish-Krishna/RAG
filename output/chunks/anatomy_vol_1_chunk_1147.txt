There are several small facial muscles, one of which
is the corrugator supercilii, which is the prime mover of the eyebrows. Place your finger on your eyebrows at the point of
the bridge of the nose. Raise your eyebrows as if you were surprised and lower your eyebrows as if you were frowning. With
these movements, you can feel the action of the corrugator supercilli. Additional muscles of facial expression are presented
in Figure 11.8.
