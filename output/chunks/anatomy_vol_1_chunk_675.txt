Opening into the posterior orbit
from the cranial cavity are the optic canal and superior orbital fissure.

256 CHAPTER 7 | AXIAL SKELETON

The Nasal Septum and Nasal Conchae

The nasal septum consists of both bone and cartilage components (Figure 7.17; see also Figure 7.11). The upper portion of
the septum is formed by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone. The lower and posterior parts of the septum are formed
by the triangular-shaped vomer bone. In an anterior view of the skull, the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone is easily
seen inside the nasal opening as the upper nasal septum, but only a small portion of the vomer is seen as the inferior septum.
 A better view of the vomer bone is seen when looking into the posterior nasal cavity with an inferior view of the skull,
where the vomer forms the full height of the nasal septum.
