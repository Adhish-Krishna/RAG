These cells will develop into the chorionic sac and the fetal portion of the
placenta (the organ of nutrient, waste, and gas exchange between mother and the developing offspring).

 The inner mass of embryonic cells is totipotent during this stage, meaning that each cell has the potential to
differentiate into any cell type in the human body. Totipotency lasts for only a few days before the cellsâ€™ fates are set as
being the precursors to a specific lineage of cells.

Figure 28.4 Pre-Embryonic Cleavages Pre-embryonic cleavages make use of the abundant cytoplasm of the
conceptus as the cells rapidly divide without changing the total volume.
