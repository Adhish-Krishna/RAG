Studies have shown that the earlier the
surgery is performed, the better the chance of survival.

 A patent ductus arteriosus is a congenital condition in which the ductus arteriosus fails to close. The condition
may range from severe to benign. Failure of the ductus arteriosus to close results in blood flowing from the higher
pressure aorta into the lower pressure pulmonary trunk. This additional fluid moving toward the lungs increases
pulmonary pressure and makes respiration difficult. Symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnea), tachycardia,
enlarged heart, a widened pulse pressure, and poor weight gain in infants. Treatments include surgical closure
(ligation), manual closure using platinum coils or specialized mesh inserted via the femoral artery or vein, or
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to block the synthesis of prostaglandin E2, which maintains the vessel in an open
position.
