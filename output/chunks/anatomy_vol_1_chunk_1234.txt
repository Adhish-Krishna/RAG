[he pelvic girdle attaches the legs to the axial skeleton. The hip joint is where the pelvic girdle and the leg come together.
 The hip is joined to the pelvic girdle by many muscles. In the gluteal region, the psoas major and iliacus form the iliopsoas.
 [he large and strong gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus extend and abduct the femur. Along with the
gluteus maximus, the tensor fascia lata muscle forms the iliotibial tract. The lateral rotators of the femur at the hip are
he piriformis, obturator internus, obturator externus, superior gemellus, inferior gemellus, and quadratus femoris. On the
edial part of the thigh, the adductor longus, adductor brevis, and adductor magnus adduct the thigh and medially rotate it.
 he pectineus muscle adducts and flexes the femur at the hip.
 The thigh muscles that move the femur, tibia, and fibula are divided into medial, anterior, and posterior compartments.
