Zonal inhibiting proteins cause the release of any other attached sperm and destroy the oocyteâ€™s sperm receptors, thus
preventing any more sperm from binding. The mucopolysaccharides then coat the nascent zygote in an impenetrable barrier
that, together with hardened zona pellucida, is called a fertilization membrane.

 The Zygote

Recall that at the point of fertilization, the oocyte has not yet completed meiosis; all secondary oocytes remain arrested
in metaphase of meiosis II until fertilization. Only upon fertilization does the oocyte complete meiosis. The unneeded
complement of genetic material that results is stored in a second polar body that is eventually ejected. At this moment, the
oocyte has become an ovum, the female haploid gamete. The two haploid nuclei derived from the sperm and oocyte and
contained within the egg are referred to as pronuclei. They decondense, expand, and replicate their DNA in preparation
for mitosis. The pronuclei then migrate toward each other, their nuclear envelopes disintegrate, and the male- and female-
derived genetic material intermingles.
