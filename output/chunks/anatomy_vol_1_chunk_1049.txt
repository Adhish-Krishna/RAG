Likewise,
decreased use of a skeletal muscle results in atrophy, where the number of sarcomeres and myofibrils disappear (but not the
number of muscle fibers). It is common for a limb in a cast to show atrophied muscles when the cast is removed, and certain
diseases, such as polio, show atrophied muscles.

Muscular System

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive weakening of the skeletal muscles. It is one of several diseases
collectively referred to as “muscular dystrophy.” DMD is caused by a lack of the protein dystrophin, which helps
the thin filaments of myofibrils bind to the sarcolemma. Without sufficient dystrophin, muscle contractions cause the

sarcolemma to tear, causing an influx of Ca‘, leading to cellular damage and muscle fiber degradation. Over time, as
muscle damage accumulates, muscle mass is lost, and greater functional impairments develop.

 DMD is an inherited disorder caused by an abnormal X chromosome.
