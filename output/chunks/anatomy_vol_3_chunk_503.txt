Sodium is actively pumped out of the PCT into the interstitial spaces between cells
and diffuses down its concentration gradient into the peritubular capillary. As it does so, water will follow passively to
maintain an isotonic fluid environment inside the capillary. This is called obligatory water reabsorption, because water is

“obliged” to follow the Na* (Figure 25.18).

Figure 25.18 Substances Reabsorbed and Secreted by the PCT

More substances move across the membranes of the PCT than any other portion of the nephron.
