(b) A single erythrocyte can contain 300 million hemoglobin molecules,

and thus more than 1 billion oxygen molecules.

 Each iron ion in the heme can bind to one oxygen molecule; therefore,
oxygen molecules. An individual erythrocyte may contain about 300 million
to and transport up to 1.2 billion oxygen molecules (see Figure 18.7b).

 each hemoglobin molecule can transport four
hemoglobin molecules, and therefore can bind

In the lungs, hemoglobin picks up oxygen, which binds to the iron ions, forming oxyhemoglobin. The bright red,
oxygenated hemoglobin travels to the body tissues, where it releases some of the oxygen molecules, becoming darker red

deoxyhemoglobin, sometimes referred to as reduced hemoglobin. Oxygen

the bloodstream. About 76 percent dissolves in the plasma, some of it remaining as dissolved COz, and the remainder
forming bicarbonate ion.
