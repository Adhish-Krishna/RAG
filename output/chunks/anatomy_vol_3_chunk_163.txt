The
contractions of these layers promote mechanical digestion, expose more of the food to digestive chemicals, and move the
food along the canal. In the most proximal and distal regions of the alimentary canal, including the mouth, pharynx, anterior
part of the esophagus, and external anal sphincter, the muscularis is made up of skeletal muscle, which gives you voluntary
control over swallowing and defecation. The basic two-layer structure found in the small intestine is modified in the organs
proximal and distal to it. The stomach is equipped for its churning function by the addition of a third layer, the oblique
muscle. While the colon has two layers like the small intestine, its longitudinal layer is segregated into three narrow parallel
bands, the tenia coli, which make it look like a series of pouches rather than a simple tube.
