CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

abducens nerve sixth cranial nerve; responsible for contraction of one of the extraocular muscles
alar plate developmental region of the spinal cord that gives rise to the posterior horn of the gray matter
amygdala nucleus deep in the temporal lobe of the cerebrum that is related to memory and emotional behavior

anterior column white matter between the anterior horns of the spinal cord composed of many different groups of
axons of both ascending and descending tracts

anterior horn gray matter of the spinal cord containing multipolar motor neurons, sometimes referred to as the ventral
horn

anterior median fissure deep midline feature of the anterior spinal cord, marking the separation between the right
and left sides of the cord

anterior spinal artery blood vessel from the merged branches of the vertebral arteries that runs along the anterior
surface of the spinal cord

arachnoid granulation outpocket of the arachnoid membrane into the dural sinuses that allows for reabsorption of
CSF into the blood

arachnoid mater middle layer of the meninges named for the spider-web-like trabeculae that extend between it and
the pia mater

arachnoid trabeculae filaments between the arachnoid and pia mater within the subarachnoid space

ascending tract central nervous system fibers carrying sensory information from the spinal cord or periphery to the
brain

axillary nerve
