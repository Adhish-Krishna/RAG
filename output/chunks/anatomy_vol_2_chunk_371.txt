The sensory pathway for gustation travels along the facial and glossopharyngeal cranial nerves, which synapse with
neurons of the solitary nucleus in the brain stem. Axons from the solitary nucleus then project to the ventral posterior
nucleus of the thalamus. Finally, axons from the ventral posterior nucleus project to the gustatory cortex of the cerebral
cortex, where taste is processed and consciously perceived.

The sensory pathway for audition travels along the vestibulocochlear nerve, which synapses with neurons in the
cochlear nuclei of the superior medulla. Within the brain stem, input from either ear is combined to extract location
information from the auditory stimuli. Whereas the initial auditory stimuli received at the cochlea strictly represent the
frequency—or pitch—of the stimuli, the locations of sounds can be determined by comparing information arriving at both
ears.
