The costal cartilage from each of these ribs attaches directly
to the sternum. Ribs 8-12 are called false ribs (vertebrochondral ribs). The costal cartilages from these ribs do not attach
directly to the sternum. For ribs 8-10, the costal cartilages are attached to the cartilage of the next higher rib. Thus, the
cartilage of rib 10 attaches to the cartilage of rib 9, rib 9 then attaches to rib 8, and rib 8 is attached to rib 7. The last two
false ribs (11-12) are also called floating ribs (vertebral ribs). These are short ribs that do not attach to the sternum at all.
 Instead, their small costal cartilages terminate within the musculature of the lateral abdominal wall.

 7.5 | Embryonic Development of the Axial Skeleton

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 ¢ Discuss the two types of embryonic bone development within the skull
¢ Describe the development of the vertebral column and thoracic cage

The axial skeleton begins to form during early embryonic development.
