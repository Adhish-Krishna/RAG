The projections of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system diverge widely, resulting in a broad
influence of the system throughout the body. As a response to a threat, the sympathetic system would increase heart rate and
breathing rate and cause blood flow to the skeletal muscle to increase and blood flow to the digestive system to decrease.
 Sweat gland secretion should also increase as part of an integrated response. All of those physiological changes are going
to be required to occur together to run away from the hunting lioness, or the modern equivalent. This divergence is seen in
the branching patterns of preganglionic sympathetic neuronsâ€”a single preganglionic sympathetic neuron may have 10-20
targets. An axon that leaves a central neuron of the lateral horn in the thoracolumbar spinal cord will pass through the white
ramus communicans and enter the sympathetic chain, where it will branch toward a variety of targets.
