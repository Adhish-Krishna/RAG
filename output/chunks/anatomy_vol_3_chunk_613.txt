Chloride functions to balance cations in the
ECF, maintaining the electrical neutrality of this fluid. The paths of secretion and reabsorption of chloride ions in the renal
system follow the paths of sodium ions.

 Hypochloremia, or lower-than-normal blood chloride levels, can occur because of defective renal tubular absorption.
 Vomiting, diarrhea, and metabolic acidosis can also lead to hypochloremia. Hyperchloremia, or higher-than-normal blood
chloride levels, can occur due to dehydration, excessive intake of dietary salt (NaCl) or swallowing of sea water, aspirin
intoxication, congestive heart failure, and the hereditary, chronic lung disease, cystic fibrosis. In people who have cystic
fibrosis, chloride levels in sweat are two to five times those of normal levels, and analysis of sweat is often used in the
diagnosis of the disease.
