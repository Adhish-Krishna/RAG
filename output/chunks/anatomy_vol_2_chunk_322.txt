The large, fleshy structure on the lateral aspect of the head is known as the auricle. Some sources
will also refer to this structure as the pinna, though that term is more appropriate for a structure that can be moved, such
as the external ear of a cat. The C-shaped curves of the auricle direct sound waves toward the auditory canal. The canal
enters the skull through the external auditory meatus of the temporal bone. At the end of the auditory canal is the tympanic
membrane, or ear drum, which vibrates after it is struck by sound waves. The auricle, ear canal, and tympanic membrane
are often referred to as the external ear. The middle ear consists of a space spanned by three small bones called the
ossicles. The three ossicles are the malleus, incus, and stapes, which are Latin names that roughly translate to hammer,
anvil, and stirrup.
