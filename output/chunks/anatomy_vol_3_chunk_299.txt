Figure 23.33 Lipid Absorption Unlike amino acids and simple sugars, lipids are transformed as they are absorbed
through epithelial cells.

 Nucleic Acid Absorption

The products of nucleic acid digestion—pentose sugars, nitrogenous bases, and phosphate ions—are transported by carriers
across the villus epithelium via active transport. These products then enter the bloodstream.

 Mineral Absorption

The electrolytes absorbed by the small intestine are from both GI secretions and ingested foods. Since electrolytes dissociate
into ions in water, most are absorbed via active transport throughout the entire small intestine.
