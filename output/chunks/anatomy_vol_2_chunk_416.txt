The axons will also branch to innervate multiple muscle fibers. Together, the motor neuron and all the muscle fibers
that it controls make up a motor unit. Motor units vary in size. Some may contain up to 1000 muscle fibers, such as in the
quadriceps, or they may only have 10 fibers, such as in an extraocular muscle. The number of muscle fibers that are part of
a motor unit corresponds to the precision of control of that muscle. Also, muscles that have finer motor control have more
motor units connecting to them, and this requires a larger topographical field in the primary motor cortex.

 Motor neuron axons connect to muscle fibers at a neuromuscular junction. This is a specialized synaptic structure at
which multiple axon terminals synapse with the muscle fiber sarcolemma. The synaptic end bulbs of the motor neurons
secrete acetylcholine, which binds to receptors on the sarcolemma. The binding of acetylcholine opens ligand-gated ion
channels, increasing the movement of cations across the sarcolemma.
