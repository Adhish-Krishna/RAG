The pain and temperature
receptors in the dermis of the skin are examples of neurons that have free nerve endings. Also located in the dermis of the
skin are lamellated corpuscles, neurons with encapsulated nerve endings that respond to pressure and touch. The cells in the
retina that respond to light stimuli are an example of a specialized receptor, a photoreceptor.
