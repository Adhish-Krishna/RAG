Instead, atoms link by forming a chemical bond. A bond is a weak or strong electrical attraction that holds atoms in
the same vicinity. The new grouping is typically more stable—less likely to react again—than its component atoms were
when they were separate. A more or less stable grouping of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds is called
a molecule. The bonded atoms may be of the same element, as in the case of H2, which is called molecular hydrogen or
hydrogen gas. When a molecule is made up of two or more atoms of different elements, it is called a chemical compound.
 Thus, a unit of water, or H2O, is a compound, as is a single molecule of the gas methane, or CH4.

 Three types of chemical bonds are important in human physiology, because they hold together substances that are used
by the body for critical aspects of homeostasis, signaling, and energy production, to name just a few important processes.
