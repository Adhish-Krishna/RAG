Although the cause of clubfoot is idiopathic (unknown), evidence indicates that fetal position within the uterus is
not a contributing factor. Genetic factors are involved, because clubfoot tends to run within families. Cigarette smoking
during pregnancy has been linked to the development of clubfoot, particularly in families with a history of clubfoot.

 Previously, clubfoot required extensive surgery. Today, 90 percent of cases are successfully treated without
surgery using new corrective casting techniques. The best chance for a full recovery requires that clubfoot treatment
begin during the first 2 weeks after birth. Corrective casting gently stretches the foot, which is followed by the
application of a holding cast to keep the foot in the proper position. This stretching and casting is repeated weekly
for several weeks. In severe cases, surgery may also be required, after which the foot typically remains in a cast for 6
to 8 weeks. After the cast is removed following either surgical or nonsurgical treatment, the child will be required to
wear a brace part-time (at night) for up to 4 years.
