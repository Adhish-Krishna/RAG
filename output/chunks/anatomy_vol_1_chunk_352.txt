Adult bone
marrow has three distinct types of stem cells: hematopoietic stem cells, which give rise to red blood cells, white blood cells,
and platelets (Figure 3.34); endothelial stem cells, which give rise to the endothelial cell types that line blood and lymph
vessels; and mesenchymal stem cells, which give rise to the different types of muscle cells.
