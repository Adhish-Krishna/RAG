The following section examines the three groups of inorganic compounds essential to life: water, salts, acids, and bases.
 Organic compounds are covered later in the chapter.

 Water

As much as 70 percent of an adult’s body weight is water. This water is contained both within the cells and between the
cells that make up tissues and organs. Its several roles make water indispensable to human functioning.

 Water as a Lubricant and Cushion

Water is a major component of many of the body’s lubricating fluids. Just as oil lubricates the hinge on a door, water
in synovial fluid lubricates the actions of body joints, and water in pleural fluid helps the lungs expand and recoil with
breathing. Watery fluids help keep food flowing through the digestive tract, and ensure that the movement of adjacent
abdominal organs is friction free.

 Water also protects cells and organs from physical trauma, cushioning the brain within the skull, for example, and
protecting the delicate nerve tissue of the eyes.
