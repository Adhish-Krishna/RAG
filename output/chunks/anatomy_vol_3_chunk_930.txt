can easily diffuse through the lipid bilayer. Large particles cannot fit in between the individual phospholipids that are packed
together, and polar molecules are repelled by the hydrophobic/nonpolar lipids that line the inside of the bilayer. 31 Receptor-
mediated endocytosis is more selective because the substances that are brought into the cell are the specific ligands that could
bind to the receptors being endocytosed. Phagocytosis or pinocytosis, on the other hand, have no such receptor-ligand specificity,
and bring in whatever materials happen to be close to the membrane when it is enveloped.
