The primary motor cortex is arranged in a similar fashion to the primary somatosensory cortex, in that it has a
topographical map of the body, creating a motor homunculus (see Figure 14.23). The neurons responsible for musculature
in the feet and lower legs are in the medial wall of the precentral gyrus, with the thighs, trunk, and shoulder at the crest
of the longitudinal fissure. The hand and face are in the lateral face of the gyrus. Also, the relative space allotted for the
different regions is exaggerated in muscles that have greater enervation. The greatest amount of cortical space is given to
muscles that perform fine, agile movements, such as the muscles of the fingers and the lower face. The “power muscles”
that perform coarser movements, such as the buttock and back muscles, occupy much less space on the motor cortex.

 Descending Pathways

The motor output from the cortex descends into the brain stem and to the spinal cord to control the musculature through
motor neurons.
