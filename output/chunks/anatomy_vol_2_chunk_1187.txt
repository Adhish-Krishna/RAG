Another way of expressing this is to say that at the venous end of the capillary, there is an NFP
of -7 mm Hg.

 Figure 20.16 Capillary Exchange Net filtration occurs near the arterial end of the capillary since capillary hydrostatic
pressure (CHP) is greater than blood colloidal osmotic pressure (BCOP).
