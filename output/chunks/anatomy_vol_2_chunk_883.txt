The nucleus is
simple in shape, sometimes with an indentation but without distinct lobes. There are two major types of agranulocytes:
lymphocytes and monocytes (see Figure 18.4).

 Lymphocytes are the only formed element of blood that arises from lymphoid stem cells. Although they form initially
in the bone marrow, much of their subsequent development and reproduction occurs in the lymphatic tissues. Lymphocytes
are the second most common type of leukocyte, accounting for about 20-30 percent of all leukocytes, and are essential for

and others three. Typically, the large cells are 10-14 ym and have a smaller nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio and more granules.
 The smaller cells are typically 6-9 ym with a larger volume of nucleus to cytoplasm, creating a “halo” effect.
