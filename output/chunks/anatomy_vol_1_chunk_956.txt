The resulting small medial rotation of the femur serves to
“lock” the knee into its fully extended and most stable position. Flexion of the knee is initiated by a slight lateral rotation
of the femur on the tibia, which “unlocks” the knee. This lateral rotation motion is produced by the popliteus muscle of the
posterior leg.
 Located between the articulating surfaces of the femur and tibia are two articular discs, the medial meniscus and
lateral meniscus (see Figure 9.19b). Each is a C-shaped fibrocartilage structure that is thin along its inside margin and
thick along the outer margin. They are attached to their tibial condyles, but do not attach to the femur. While both menisci
are free to move during knee motions, the medial meniscus shows less movement because it is anchored at its outer margin
to the articular capsule and tibial collateral ligament.
