CHAPTER 7 | AXIAL SKELETON

Lumbar Vertebrae

Lumbar vertebrae carry the greatest amount of body weight and are thus characterized by the large size and thickness
of the vertebral body (Figure 7.28). They have short transverse processes and a short, blunt spinous process that projects
posteriorly. The articular processes are large, with the superior process facing backward and the inferior facing forward.

Figure 7.28 Lumbar Vertebrae Lumbar vertebrae are characterized by having a large, thick body and a short,
rounded spinous process.

 Sacrum and Coccyx

The sacrum is a triangular-shaped bone that is thick and wide across its superior base where it is weight bearing and then
tapers down to an inferior, non-weight bearing apex (Figure 7.29).
