Hemoglobin that is not phagocytized is broken down in the
circulation, releasing alpha and beta chains that are removed from circulation by the kidneys.

 ¢ The iron contained in the heme portion of hemoglobin may be stored in the liver or spleen, primarily in the form of
ferritin or hemosiderin, or carried through the bloodstream by transferrin to the red bone marrow for recycling into
new erythrocytes.

 ¢ The non-iron portion of heme is degraded into the waste product biliverdin, a green pigment, and then into another
waste product, bilirubin, a yellow pigment. Bilirubin binds to albumin and travels in the blood to the liver, which
uses it in the manufacture of bile, a compound released into the intestines to help emulsify dietary fats. In the large
intestine, bacteria breaks the bilirubin apart from the bile and converts it to urobilinogen and then into stercobilin. It is
then eliminated from the body in the feces. Broad-spectrum antibiotics typically eliminate these bacteria as well and
may alter the color of feces.
