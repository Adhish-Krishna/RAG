These are the same physiological changes associated with the fight-or-
flight response, but there is nothing chasing you on that treadmill.

 This is not a simple homeostatic mechanism at work because “maintaining the internal environment” would mean
getting all those changes back to their set points. Instead, the sympathetic system has become active during exercise so
that your body can cope with what is happening. A homeostatic mechanism is dealing with the conscious decision to
push the body away from a resting state. The heart, actually, is moving away from its homeostatic set point. Without
any input from the autonomic system, the heart would beat at approximately 100 bpm, and the parasympathetic system
slows that down to the resting rate of approximately 70 bpm. But in the middle of a good workout, you should see your
heart rate at 120-140 bpm. You could say that the body is stressed because of what you are doing to it.
