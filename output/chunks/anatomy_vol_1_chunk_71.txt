An effector is the component in a feedback system
that causes a change to reverse the situation and return the value to the normal range.

Figure 1.10 Negative Feedback Loop In a negative feedback loop, a stimulus—a deviation from a set point—is
resisted through a physiological process that returns the body to homeostasis. (a) A negative feedback loop has four
basic parts. (b) Body temperature is regulated by negative feedback.

 In order to set the system in motion, a stimulus must drive a physiological parameter beyond its normal range (that is,
beyond homeostasis). This stimulus is “heard” by a specific sensor. For example, in the control of blood glucose, specific
endocrine cells in the pancreas detect excess glucose (the stimulus) in the bloodstream.
