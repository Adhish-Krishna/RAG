Both the
uterine arteries and vaginal arteries, which distribute blood to the vagina, are branches of the internal iliac artery. The four
paired lumbar arteries are the counterparts of the intercostal arteries and supply blood to the lumbar region, the abdomina
wall, and the spinal cord. In some instances, a fifth pair of lumbar arteries emerges from the median sacral artery.

 The aorta divides at approximately the level of vertebra L4 into a left and a right common iliac artery but continues as
a small vessel, the median sacral artery, into the sacrum. The common iliac arteries provide blood to the pelvic region and
ultimately to the lower limbs. They split into external and internal iliac arteries approximately at the level of the lumbar-
sacral articulation. Each internal iliac artery sends branches to the urinary bladder, the walls of the pelvis, the external
genitalia, and the medial portion of the femoral region.
