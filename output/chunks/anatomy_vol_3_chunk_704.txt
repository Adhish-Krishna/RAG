Figure 27.11 Oogenesis The unequal cell division of oogenesis produces one to three polar bodies that later
degrade, as well as a single haploid ovum, which is produced only if there is penetration of the secondary oocyte by a
sperm cell.

 How does the diploid secondary oocyte become an ovum—the haploid female gamete? Meiosis of a secondary oocyte
is completed only if a sperm succeeds in penetrating its barriers. Meiosis II then resumes, producing one haploid ovum that,
at the instant of fertilization by a (haploid) sperm, becomes the first diploid cell of the new offspring (a zygote).
