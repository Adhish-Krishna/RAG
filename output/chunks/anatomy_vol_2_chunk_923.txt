Thus, anti-A or anti-B antibodies that might be circulating in the patient’s blood plasma will not encounter any
erythrocyte surface antigens on the donated blood and therefore will not be provoked into a response. One problem with
this designation of universal donor is if the O- individual had prior exposure to Rh antigen, Rh antibodies may be present
in the donated blood. Also, introducing type O blood into an individual with type A, B, or AB blood will nevertheless
introduce antibodies against both A and B antigens, as these are always circulating in the type O blood plasma. This may
cause problems for the recipient, but because the volume of blood transfused is much lower than the volume of the patient’s
own blood, the adverse effects of the relatively few infused plasma antibodies are typically limited.
