The anterior (ventral) cavity has two main subdivisions: the thoracic cavity and the abdominopelvic cavity (see Figure
1.15). The thoracic cavity is the more superior subdivision of the anterior cavity, and it is enclosed by the rib cage. The
thoracic cavity contains the lungs and the heart, which is located in the mediastinum. The diaphragm forms the floor of the
thoracic cavity and separates it from the more inferior abdominopelvic cavity. The abdominopelvic cavity is the largest
cavity in the body. Although no membrane physically divides the abdominopelvic cavity, it can be useful to distinguish
between the abdominal cavity, the division that houses the digestive organs, and the pelvic cavity, the division that houses
the organs of reproduction.

 Abdominal Regions and Quadrants

To promote clear communication, for instance about the location of a patientâ€™s abdominal pain or a suspicious mass, health
care providers typically divide up the cavity into either nine regions or four quadrants (Figure 1.16).
