The key to understanding the autonomic system is to explore the response
pathwaysâ€”the output of the nervous system. The way we respond to the world around us, to manage the internal
environment on the basis of the external environment, is divided between two parts of the autonomic nervous system.
 The sympathetic division responds to threats and produces a readiness to confront the threat or to run away: the fight-or-

immediate danger, a restful mode descends on the body, and the digestive system is more active.

 The sympathetic output of the nervous system originates out of the lateral horn of the thoracolumbar spinal cord. An
axon from one of these central neurons projects by way of the ventral spinal nerve root and spinal nerve to a sympathetic
ganglion, either in the sympathetic chain ganglia or one of the collateral locations, where it synapses on a ganglionic neuron.
