This pressure forces plasma and nutrients out of the capillaries and into surrounding tissues. Fluid
and the cellular wastes in the tissues enter the capillaries at the venule end, where the hydrostatic pressure is less than the
osmotic pressure in the vessel. Filtration pressure squeezes fluid from the plasma in the blood to the IF surrounding the
tissue cells. The surplus fluid in the interstitial space that is not returned directly back to the capillaries is drained from
tissues by the lymphatic system, and then re-enters the vascular system at the subclavian veins.
