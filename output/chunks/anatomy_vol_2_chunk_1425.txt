Different bacterial strains differ in the
antigens on their surfaces. The immune response against one strain (antigen) does not affect the other; thus, the species
survives.

 Another method of immune evasion is mutation. Because viruses’ surface molecules mutate continuously, viruses like
influenza change enough each year that the flu vaccine for one year may not protect against the flu common to the next.
 New vaccine formulations must be derived for each flu season.

 Genetic recombination—the combining of gene segments from two different pathogens—is an efficient form of
immune evasion. For example, the influenza virus contains gene segments that can recombine when two different viruses
infect the same cell. Recombination between human and pig influenza viruses led to the 2010 H1N1 swine flu outbreak.

 Pathogens can produce immunosuppressive molecules that impair immune function, and there are several different
types. Viruses are especially good at evading the immune response in this way, and many types of viruses have been shown
to suppress the host immune response in ways much more subtle than the wholesale destruction caused by HIV.
