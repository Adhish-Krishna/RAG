Skeletal System

Head and traumatic brain injuries are major causes of immediate death and disability, with bleeding and infections as
possible additional complications. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2010), approximately
30 percent of all injury-related deaths in the United States are caused by head injuries. The majority of head injuries
involve falls. They are most common among young children (ages 0-4 years), adolescents (15-19 years), and the
elderly (over 65 years). Additional causes vary, but prominent among these are automobile and motorcycle accidents.

 Strong blows to the brain-case portion of the skull can produce fractures. These may result in bleeding inside the
skull with subsequent injury to the brain.
