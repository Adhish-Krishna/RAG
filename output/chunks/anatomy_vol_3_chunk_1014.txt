IP3 causes the release of calcium, another second messenger,
rom intracellular stores. This causes further signaling events. 42 An intracellular hormone receptor is located within the cell.
 A hydrophobic hormone diffuses through the cell membrane and binds to the intracellular hormone receptor, which may be in
the cytosol or in the cell nucleus. This hormone-receptor complex binds to a segment of DNA. This initiates the transcription
of a target gene, the end result of which is protein assembly and the hormonal response. 43 The anterior lobe of the pituitary
gland is connected to the hypothalamus by vasculature, which allows regulating hormones from the hypothalamus to travel to
the anterior pituitary. In contrast, the posterior lobe is connected to the hypothalamus by a bridge of nerve axons called the
hypothalamicâ€”hypophyseal tract, along which the hypothalamus sends hormones produced by hypothalamic nerve cell bodies to
the posterior pituitary for storage and release into the circulation.
