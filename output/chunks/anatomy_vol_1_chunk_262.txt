A ligand is the specific molecule that binds
to and activates a receptor. Some integral proteins serve dual roles as both a receptor and an ion channel. One example of a
receptor-ligand interaction is the receptors on nerve cells that bind neurotransmitters, such as dopamine. When a dopamine
molecule binds to a dopamine receptor protein, a channel within the transmembrane protein opens to allow certain ions to
flow into the cell.

 Some integral membrane proteins are glycoproteins. A glycoprotein is a protein that has carbohydrate molecules
attached, which extend into the extracellular matrix. The attached carbohydrate tags on glycoproteins aid in cell recognition.
 The carbohydrates that extend from membrane proteins and even from some membrane lipids collectively form the
glycocalyx. The glycocalyx is a fuzzy-appearing coating around the cell formed from glycoproteins and other carbohydrates
attached to the cell membrane. The glycocalyx can have various roles. For example, it may have molecules that allow the
cell to bind to another cell, it may contain receptors for hormones, or it might have enzymes to break down nutrients.
