A disulfide bond is
a covalent bond between sulfur atoms in a polypeptide. Often, two or more separate polypeptides bond to form an even
larger protein with a quaternary structure (see Figure 2.26d). The polypeptide subunits forming a quaternary structure
can be identical or different. For instance, hemoglobin, the protein found in red blood cells is composed of four tertiary
polypeptides, two of which are called alpha chains and two of which are called beta chains.

 When they are exposed to extreme heat, acids, bases, and certain other substances, proteins will denature.
 Denaturation is a change in the structure of a molecule through physical or chemical means. Denatured proteins lose their
functional shape and are no longer able to carry out their jobs. An everyday example of protein denaturation is the curdling
of milk when acidic lemon juice is added.
 The contribution of the shape of a protein to its function can hardly be exaggerated. For example, the long, slender
shape of protein strands that make up muscle tissue is essential to their ability to contract (shorten) and relax (lengthen).
