An anion that has accepted two electrons has a net charge of —2. The ionic form of selenium (Se), for
example, is typically written Se>.

 The opposite charges of cations and anions exert a moderately strong mutual attraction that keeps the atoms in close
proximity forming an ionic bond. An ionic bond is an ongoing, close association between ions of opposite charge. The table
salt you sprinkle on your food owes its existence to ionic bonding. As shown in Figure 2.8, sodium commonly donates an
electron to chlorine, becoming the cation N. a’. When chlorine accepts the electron, it becomes the chloride anion, Cl”. With
their opposing charges, these two ions strongly attract each other.

only one electron to have a full valence shell.
