The baroreceptors in the venae cavae and right atrium monitor blood pressure as the blood returns to the heart from
the systemic circulation. Normally, blood flow into the aorta is the same as blood flow back into the right atrium. If blood
is returning to the right atrium more rapidly than it is being ejected from the left ventricle, the atrial receptors will stimulate
the cardiovascular centers to increase sympathetic firing and increase cardiac output until homeostasis is achieved. The
opposite is also true. This mechanism is referred to as the atrial reflex.

 Chemoreceptor Reflexes

In addition to the baroreceptors are chemoreceptors that monitor levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen ions (pH),
and thereby contribute to vascular homeostasis. Chemoreceptors monitoring the blood are located in close proximity to the
baroreceptors in the aortic and carotid sinuses. They signal the cardiovascular center as well as the respiratory centers in the
medulla oblongata.
 Since tissues consume oxygen and produce carbon dioxide and acids as waste products, when the body is more active,
oxygen levels fall and carbon dioxide levels rise as cells undergo cellular respiration to meet the energy needs of activities.
