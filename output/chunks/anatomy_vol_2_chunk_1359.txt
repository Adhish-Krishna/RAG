Cytokines are
secreted into the intercellular space, and the action of the cytokine induces the receiving cell to change its physiology. A
chemokine is a soluble chemical mediator similar to cytokines except that its function is to attract cells (chemotaxis) from
longer distances.

Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/chemotaxis) to learn about phagocyte chemotaxis. Phagocyte
chemotaxis is the movement of phagocytes according to the secretion of chemical messengers in the form of
interleukins and other chemokines. By what means does a phagocyte destroy a bacterium that it has ingested?

Early induced Proteins

Early induced proteins are those that are not constitutively present in the body, but are made as they are needed early during
the innate immune response.
