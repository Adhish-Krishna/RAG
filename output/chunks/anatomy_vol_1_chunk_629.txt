Discuss the embryonic development of the axial skeleton


240 CHAPTER 7 | AXIAL SKELETON

The skeletal system forms the rigid internal framework of the body. It consists of the bones, cartilages, and ligaments. Bones
support the weight of the body, allow for body movements, and protect internal organs. Cartilage provides flexible strength
and support for body structures such as the thoracic cage, the external ear, and the trachea and larynx. At joints of the body,
cartilage can also unite adjacent bones or provide cushioning between them. Ligaments are the strong connective tissue
bands that hold the bones at a moveable joint together and serve to prevent excessive movements of the joint that would
result in injury. Providing movement of the skeleton are the muscles of the body, which are firmly attached to the skeleton
via connective tissue structures called tendons. As muscles contract, they pull on the bones to produce movements of the
body. Thus, without a skeleton, you would not be able to stand, run, or even feed yourself!
