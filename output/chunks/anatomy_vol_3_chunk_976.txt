A synarthrosis,
which is an immobile joint, serves to strongly connect bones thus protecting internal organs such as the heart or brain. A slightly
moveable amphiarthrosis provides for small movements, which in the vertebral column can add together to yield a much larger
overall movement. The freedom of movement provided by a diarthrosis can allow for large movements, such as is seen with most
joints of the limbs. 55 Narrow fibrous joints are found at a suture, gomphosis, or syndesmosis. A suture is the fibrous joint that
joins the bones of the skull to each other (except the mandible). A gomphosis is the fibrous joint that anchors each tooth to its bony
socket within the upper or lower jaw. The tooth is connected to the bony jaw by periodontal ligaments. A narrow syndesmosis
is found at the distal tibiofibular joint where the bones are united by fibrous connective tissue and ligaments. A syndesmosis can
also form a wide fibrous joint where the shafts of two parallel bones are connected by a broad interosseous membrane.
