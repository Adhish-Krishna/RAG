Pons

The word pons comes from the Latin word for bridge. It is visible on the anterior surface of the brain stem as the thick
bundle of white matter attached to the cerebellum. The pons is the main connection between the cerebellum and the brain
stem. The bridge-like white matter is only the anterior surface of the pons; the gray matter beneath that is a continuation of
the tegmentum from the midbrain. Gray matter in the tegmentum region of the pons contains neurons receiving descending
input from the forebrain that is sent to the cerebellum.

 Medulla

The medulla is the region known as the myelencephalon in the embryonic brain. The initial portion of the name, “myel,”
refers to the significant white matter found in this region—especially on its exterior, which is continuous with the white
matter of the spinal cord.
