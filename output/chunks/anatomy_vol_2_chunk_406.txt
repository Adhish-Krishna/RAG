The axons of the corticobulbar tract are ipsilateral,
meaning they project from the cortex to the motor nucleus on the same side of the nervous system. Conversely, the axons
of the corticospinal tract are largely contralateral, meaning that they cross the midline of the brain stem or spinal cord and
synapse on the opposite side of the body. Therefore, the right motor cortex of the cerebrum controls muscles on the left side
of the body, and vice versa.

 The corticospinal tract descends from the cortex through the deep white matter of the cerebrum. It then passes between
the caudate nucleus and putamen of the basal nuclei as a bundle called the internal capsule. The tract then passes through
the midbrain as the cerebral peduncles, after which it burrows through the pons. Upon entering the medulla, the tracts
make up the large white matter tract referred to as the pyramids (Figure 14.28). The defining landmark of the medullary-
spinal border is the pyramidal decussation, which is where most of the fibers in the corticospinal tract cross over to the
opposite side of the brain.
