This allows the two bones to fit together like a rider sitting on a saddle. Saddle joints
are functionally classified as biaxial joints. The primary example is the first carpometacarpal joint, between the trapezium (a
carpal bone) and the first metacarpal bone at the base of the thumb. This joint provides the thumb the ability to move away
from the palm of the hand along two planes. Thus, the thumb can move within the same plane as the palm of the hand, or
it can jut out anteriorly, perpendicular to the palm. This movement of the first carpometacarpal joint is what gives humans
their distinctive “opposable” thumbs. The sternoclavicular joint is also classified as a saddle joint.

 Plane Joint

At a plane joint (gliding joint), the articulating surfaces of the bones are flat or slightly curved and of approximately
the same size, which allows the bones to slide against each other (see Figure 9.10d).
