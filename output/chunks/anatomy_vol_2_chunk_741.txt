When one of each of these
intermediaries is linked by covalent bonds, the resulting compound is triiodothyronine (T3), a thyroid hormone with
three iodines. Much more commonly, two copies of the second intermediary bond, forming tetraiodothyronine, also
known as thyroxine (T4), a thyroid hormone with four iodines.

 These hormones remain in the colloid center of the thyroid follicles until TSH stimulates endocytosis of colloid back
into the follicle cells. There, lysosomal enzymes break apart the thyroglobulin colloid, releasing free T3 and T4, which
diffuse across the follicle cell membrane and enter the bloodstream.

 n the bloodstream, less than one percent of the circulating T3 and T4 remains unbound. This free T3 and T4 can cross
the lipid bilayer of cell membranes and be taken up by cells. The remaining 99 percent of circulating T3 and T4 is bound
to specialized transport proteins called thyroxine-binding globulins (TBGs), to albumin, or to other plasma proteins.
