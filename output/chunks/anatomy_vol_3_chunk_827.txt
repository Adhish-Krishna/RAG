The
newbornâ€™s first stools consist almost entirely of meconium; they later transition to seedy yellow stools or slightly
formed tan stools as meconium is cleared and replaced with digested breast milk or formula, respectively. Unlike
these later stools, meconium is sterile; it is devoid of bacteria because the fetus is in a sterile environment and has not
consumed any breast milk or formula. Typically, an infant does not pass meconium until after birth. However, in 5-20
percent of births, the fetus has a bowel movement in utero, which can cause major complications in the newborn.

 The passage of meconium in the uterus signals fetal distress, particularly fetal hypoxia (i.e., oxygen deprivation).
 This may be caused by maternal drug abuse (especially tobacco or cocaine), maternal hypertension, depletion of
amniotic fluid, long labor or difficult birth, or a defect in the placenta that prevents it from delivering adequate oxygen
to the fetus.
