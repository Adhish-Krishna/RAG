The adrenal glands have a rich blood supply and experience one of the highest rates of blood flow
in the body. They are served by several arteries branching off the aorta, including the suprarenal and renal arteries. Blood
flows to each adrenal gland at the adrenal cortex and then drains into the adrenal medulla. Adrenal hormones are released
into the circulation via the left and right suprarenal veins.
