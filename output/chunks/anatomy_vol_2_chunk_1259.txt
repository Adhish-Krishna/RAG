Since the blood has already passed through the systemic capillaries, it will
be relatively low in oxygen concentration. In many cases, there will be veins draining organs and regions of the body with
the same name as the arteries that supplied these regions and the two often parallel one another. This is often described as
a “complementary” pattern. However, there is a great deal more variability in the venous circulation than normally occurs
in the arteries. For the sake of brevity and clarity, this text will discuss only the most commonly encountered patterns.
 However, keep this variation in mind when you move from the classroom to clinical practice.

 In both the neck and limb regions, there are often both superficial and deeper levels of veins. The deeper veins
generally correspond to the complementary arteries. The superficial veins do not normally have direct arterial counterparts,
but in addition to returning blood, they also make contributions to the maintenance of body temperature.
