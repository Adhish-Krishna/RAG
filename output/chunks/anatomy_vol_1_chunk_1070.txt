SO fibers are extensively supplied with
blood capillaries to supply O2 from the red blood cells in the bloodstream. The SO fibers also possess myoglobin, an O2-
carrying molecule similar to O2-carrying hemoglobin in the red blood cells. The myoglobin stores some of the needed O2
within the fibers themselves (and gives SO fibers their red color). All of these features allow SO fibers to produce large
quantities of ATP, which can sustain muscle activity without fatiguing for long periods of time.

 The fact that SO fibers can function for long periods without fatiguing makes them useful in maintaining posture,
producing isometric contractions, stabilizing bones and joints, and making small movements that happen often but do not
require large amounts of energy. They do not produce high tension, and thus they are not used for powerful, fast movements
that require high amounts of energy and rapid cross-bridge cycling.
