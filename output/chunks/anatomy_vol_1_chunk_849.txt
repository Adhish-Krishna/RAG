The clavicle is
an anterior bone whose sternal end articulates with the manubrium of the sternum at the sternoclavicular joint. The sternal
end is also anchored to the first rib by the costoclavicular ligament. The acromial end of the clavicle articulates with the
acromion of the scapula at the acromioclavicular joint. This end is also anchored to the coracoid process of the scapula by
the coracoclavicular ligament, which provides indirect support for the acromioclavicular joint. The clavicle supports the
scapula, transmits the weight and forces from the upper limb to the body trunk, and protects the underlying nerves and blood
vessels.

 The scapula lies on the posterior aspect of the pectoral girdle. It mediates the attachment of the upper limb to the
clavicle, and contributes to the formation of the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint. This triangular bone has three sides called the
medial, lateral, and superior borders. The suprascapular notch is located on the superior border. The scapula also has three
corners, two of which are the superior and inferior angles.
