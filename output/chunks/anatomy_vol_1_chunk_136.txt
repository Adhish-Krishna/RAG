Protium (1H) Deuterium (?H) Tritium (3H)

Figure 2.5 |lsotopes of Hydrogen Protium, designated 1H, has one proton and no neutrons. It is by far the
most abundant isotope of hydrogen in nature. Deuterium, designated 2H, has one proton and one neutron. Tritium,
designated 3H, has two neutrons.

 An isotope that contains more than the usual number of neutrons is referred to as a heavy isotope. An example is
Mc, Heavy isotopes tend to be unstable, and unstable isotopes are radioactive. A radioactive isotope is an isotope whose
nucleus readily decays, giving off subatomic particles and electromagnetic energy. Different radioactive isotopes (also
called radioisotopes) differ in their half-life, the time it takes for half of any size sample of an isotope to decay. For example,
the half-life of tritium—a radioisotope of hydrogen—is about 12 years, indicating it takes 12 years for half of the tritium
nuclei in a sample to decay.
