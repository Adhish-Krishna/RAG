CHAPTER 1| AN INTRODUCTION TO THE HUMAN BODY 27

1.5 | Homeostasis

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 * Discuss the role of homeostasis in healthy functioning
* Contrast negative and positive feedback, giving one physiologic example of each mechanism

Maintaining homeostasis requires that the body continuously monitor its internal conditions. From body temperature to
blood pressure to levels of certain nutrients, each physiological condition has a particular set point. A set point is the
physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates. A normal range is the restricted set of values that is
optimally healthful and stable. For example, the set point for normal human body temperature is approximately 37°C
(98.6°F) Physiological parameters, such as body temperature and blood pressure, tend to fluctuate within a normal range
a few degrees above and below that point.
