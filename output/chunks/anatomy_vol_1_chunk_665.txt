Palatine Bone

The palatine bone is one of a pair of irregularly shaped bones that contribute small areas to the lateral walls of the nasal
cavity and the medial wall of each orbit. The largest region of each of the palatine bone is the horizontal plate. The plates
from the right and left palatine bones join together at the midline to form the posterior quarter of the hard palate (see Figure
7.8a). Thus, the palatine bones are best seen in an inferior view of the skull and hard palate.

Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate

During embryonic development, the right and left maxilla bones come together at the midline to form the upper jaw.
 At the same time, the muscle and skin overlying these bones join together to form the upper lip. Inside the mouth,
the palatine processes of the maxilla bones, along with the horizontal plates of the right and left palatine bones, join
together to form the hard palate.
