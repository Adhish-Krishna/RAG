Being less dense than bone, the
area of epiphyseal cartilage is seen on this radiograph as the
dark epiphyseal gaps located near the ends of the long bones,
including the radius, ulna, metacarpal, and phalanx bones.
 Which of the bones in this image do not show an epiphyseal
plate (epiphyseal gap)?

synjoints) to see an animation of synovial joints in action.
 Synovial joints are places where bones articulate with each
other inside of a joint cavity. The different types of synovial
joints are the ball-and-socket joint (shoulder joint), hinge
joint (knee), pivot joint (atlantoaxial joint, between C1 and
C2 vertebrae of the neck), condyloid joint (radiocarpal joint
of the wrist), saddle joint (first carpometacarpal joint,
between the trapezium carpal bone and the first metacarpal
bone, at the base of the thumb), and plane joint (facet joints
of vertebral column, between superior and inferior articular
processes).
