At a point in
the past, a common ancestor gave rise to the two species of humans and chimpanzees. That evolutionary history is
long and is still an area of intense study. But something happened to increase the size of the human brain relative to
the chimpanzee. Read this article (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/hugebrain) in which the author explores the current
understanding of why this happened.

 According to one hypothesis about the expansion of brain size, what tissue might have been sacrificed so energy
was available to grow our larger brain? Based on what you know about that tissue and nervous tissue, why would there
be a trade-off between them in terms of energy use?
