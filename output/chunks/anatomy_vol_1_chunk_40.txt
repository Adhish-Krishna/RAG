Even the three-dimensional structure of certain molecules is essential to their function.

 Your study of anatomy and physiology will make more sense if you continually relate the form of the structures you
are studying to their function. In fact, it can be somewhat frustrating to attempt to study anatomy without an understanding
of the physiology that a body structure supports. Imagine, for example, trying to appreciate the unique arrangement of the
bones of the human hand if you had no conception of the function of the hand. Fortunately, your understanding of how
the human hand manipulates tools—from pens to cell phones—helps you appreciate the unique alignment of the thumb
in opposition to the four fingers, making your hand a structure that allows you to pinch and grasp objects and type text
messages.
