Figure 23.2 Components of the Digestive System All digestive organs play integral roles in the life-sustaining
process of digestion.

 As is the case with all body systems, the digestive system does not work in isolation; it functions cooperatively
with the other systems of the body. Consider for example, the interrelationship between the digestive and cardiovascular
systems. Arteries supply the digestive organs with oxygen and processed nutrients, and veins drain the digestive tract. These
intestinal veins, constituting the hepatic portal system, are unique; they do not return blood directly to the heart.
