The initial tests of orientation are based on the questions, “Do you know what the date is?” or “Do
you know where you are?” or “What is your name?” Further understanding of a patient’s awareness of orientation can come
from questions that address remote memory, such as “Who is the President of the United States?”, or asking what happened
on a specific date.
 There are also specific tasks to address memory. One is the three-word recall test. The patient is given three words to
recall, such as book, clock, and shovel. After a short interval, during which other parts of the interview continue, the patient
is asked to recall the three words. Other tasks that assess memory—aside from those related to orientation—have the patient
recite the months of the year in reverse order to avoid the overlearned sequence and focus on the memory of the months in
an order, or to spell common words backwards, or to recite a list of numbers back.
