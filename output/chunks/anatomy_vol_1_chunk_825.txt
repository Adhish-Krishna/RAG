Tibia
The tibia (shin bone) is the medial bone of the leg and is larger than the fibula, with which it is paired (Figure 8.18). The

tibia is the main weight-bearing bone of the lower leg and the second longest bone of the body, after the femur. The medial

side of the tibia is located immediately under the skin, allowing it to be easily palpated down the entire length of the medial
leg.
