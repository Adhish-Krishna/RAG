It is anchored to the inner surface of the cranium and vertebral cavity. The arachnoid mater is a membrane
of thin fibrous tissue that forms a loose sac around the CNS. Beneath the arachnoid is a thin, filamentous mesh called the
arachnoid trabeculae, which looks like a spider web, giving this layer its name. Directly adjacent to the surface of the
CNS is the pia mater, a thin fibrous membrane that follows the convolutions of gyri and sulci in the cerebral cortex and fits
into other grooves and indentations (Figure 13.17).

Figure 13.17 Meningeal Layers of Superior Sagittal Sinus The layers of the meninges in the longitudinal fissure of
the superior sagittal sinus are shown, with the dura mater adjacent to the inner surface of the cranium, the pia mater
adjacent to the surface of the brain, and the arachnoid and subarachnoid space between them.
