44 The mammary glands are the target tissues for prolactin. 45
lodine deficiency in a pregnant woman would also deprive the fetus. Iodine is required for the synthesis of thyroid hormones,
which contribute to fetal growth and development, including maturation of the nervous system. Insufficient amounts would impair
these functions. 46 Hyperthyroidism is an abnormally elevated blood level of thyroid hormones due to an overproduction of T3
and T4. An individual with hyperthyroidism is likely to lose weight because one of the primary roles of thyroid hormones is to
increase the bodyâ€™s basal metabolic rate, increasing the breakdown of nutrients and the production of ATP. 47 The production
and secretion of PTH is regulated by a negative feedback loop. Low blood calcium levels initiate the production and secretion
of PTH. PTH increases bone resorption, calcium absorption from the intestines, and calcium reabsorption by the kidneys. As a
result, blood calcium levels begin to rise. This, in turn, inhibits the further production and secretion of PTH.
