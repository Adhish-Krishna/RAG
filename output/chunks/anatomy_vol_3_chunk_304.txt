THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 1075

small intestine section of the alimentary canal where most digestion and absorption occurs
soft palate posterior region of the bottom portion of the nasal cavity that consists of skeletal muscle

stomach alimentary canal organ that contributes to chemical and mechanical digestion of food from the esophagus
before releasing it, as chyme, to the small intestine

sublingual gland one of a pair of major salivary glands located beneath the tongue
submandibular gland one of a pair of major salivary glands located in the floor of the mouth
submucosal plexus (plexus of Meissner) nerve supply that regulates activity of glands and smooth muscle

submucosa layer of dense connective tissue in the alimentary canal wall that binds the overlying mucosa to the
underlying muscularis

sucrase brush border enzyme that breaks down sucrose into glucose and fructose

tenia coli one of three smooth muscle bands that make up the longitudinal muscle layer of the muscularis in all of the
large intestine except the terminal end

tongue accessory digestive organ of the mouth, the bulk of which is composed of skeletal muscle
transverse colon part of the colon between the ascending colon and the descending colon

upper esophageal sphincter skeletal muscle sphincter that regulates food movement from the pharynx to the
esophagus

Valsalvaâ€™s maneuver voluntary contraction of the diaphragm and abdominal wall muscles and closing of the glottis,
which increases intra-abdominal pressure and facilitates defecation

villus projection of the mucosa of the small intestine
voluntary phase initial phase of deglutition, in which the bolus moves from the mouth to the oropharynx
a-dextrinase brush border enzyme that acts on a-dextrins

a-dextrin breakdown product of starch
