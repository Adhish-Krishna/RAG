As you can see in
Figure 23.13, the esophagus runs a mainly straight route through the mediastinum of the thorax. To enter the abdomen, the
esophagus penetrates the diaphragm through an opening called the esophageal hiatus.

 Passage of Food through the Esophagus

The upper esophageal sphincter, which is continuous with the inferior pharyngeal constrictor, controls the movement of
food from the pharynx into the esophagus. The upper two-thirds of the esophagus consists of both smooth and skeletal
muscle fibers, with the latter fading out in the bottom third of the esophagus. Rhythmic waves of peristalsis, which begin
in the upper esophagus, propel the bolus of food toward the stomach. Meanwhile, secretions from the esophageal mucosa
lubricate the esophagus and food. Food passes from the esophagus into the stomach at the lower esophageal sphincter
(also called the gastroesophageal or cardiac sphincter). Recall that sphincters are muscles that surround tubes and serve
as valves, closing the tube when the sphincters contract and opening it when they relax.
