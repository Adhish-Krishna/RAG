Stimulation of these receptors provokes an appropriate reflex that furthers the
process of digestion. This may entail sending a message that activates the glands that secrete digestive juices into the lumen,
or it may mean the stimulation of muscles within the alimentary canal, thereby activating peristalsis and segmentation that
move food along the intestinal tract.

 The walls of the entire alimentary canal are embedded with nerve plexuses that interact with the central nervous
system and other nerve plexusesâ€”either within the same digestive organ or in different ones. These interactions prompt
several types of reflexes. Extrinsic nerve plexuses orchestrate long reflexes, which involve the central and autonomic
nervous systems and work in response to stimuli from outside the digestive system. Short reflexes, on the other hand, are
orchestrated by intrinsic nerve plexuses within the alimentary canal wall. These two plexuses and their connections were
introduced earlier as the enteric nervous system. Short reflexes regulate activities in one area of the digestive tract and may
coordinate local peristaltic movements and stimulate digestive secretions.
