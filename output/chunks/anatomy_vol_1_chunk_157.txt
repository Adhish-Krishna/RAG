For human physiology, the resulting bond is one of the most important formed by
waterâ€”the hydrogen bond.

 Hydrogen Bonds

A hydrogen bond is formed when a weakly positive hydrogen atom already bonded to one electronegative atom (for
example, the oxygen in the water molecule) is attracted to another electronegative atom from another molecule. In other
words, hydrogen bonds always include hydrogen that is already part of a polar molecule.

 The most common example of hydrogen bonding in the natural world occurs between molecules of water. It happens
before your eyes whenever two raindrops merge into a larger bead, or a creek spills into a river. Hydrogen bonding occurs
because the weakly negative oxygen atom in one water molecule is attracted to the weakly positive hydrogen atoms of two
other water molecules (Figure 2.11).

Figure 2.11 Hydrogen Bonds between Water Molecules Notice that the bonds occur between the weakly positive
charge on the hydrogen atoms and the weakly negative charge on the oxygen atoms.
