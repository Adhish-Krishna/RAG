Three major bursae and a fat pad are part of the complex joint that unites the femur and tibia of the
leg.

 A tendon sheath is similar in structure to a bursa, but smaller. It is a connective tissue sac that surrounds a muscle
tendon at places where the tendon crosses a joint. It contains a lubricating fluid that allows for smooth motions of the tendon
during muscle contraction and joint movements.

Types of Synovial Joints

Synovial joints are subdivided based on the shapes of the articulating surfaces of the bones that form each joint. The six
types of synovial joints are pivot, hinge, condyloid, saddle, plane, and ball-and socket-joints (Figure 9.10).
