The veins that collect nutrient-rich blood from the small intestine (where most absorption occurs) empty into the
hepatic portal system. This venous network takes the blood into the liver where the nutrients are either processed or
stored for later use. Only then does the blood drained from the alimentary canal viscera circulate back to the heart. To
appreciate just how demanding the digestive process is on the cardiovascular system, consider that while you are “resting
and digesting,” about one-fourth of the blood pumped with each heartbeat enters arteries serving the intestines.

 The Peritoneum

The digestive organs within the abdominal cavity are held in place by the peritoneum, a broad serous membranous sac
made up of squamous epithelial tissue surrounded by connective tissue. It is composed of two different regions: the parietal
peritoneum, which lines the abdominal wall, and the visceral peritoneum, which envelopes the abdominal organs (Figure
23.4).
