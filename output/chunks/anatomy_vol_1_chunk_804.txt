The inverted V-shape formed as the ischiopubic rami from both sides come together at the pubic symphysis is
called the subpubic angle.

 Pelvis

The pelvis consists of four bones: the right and left hip bones, the sacrum, and the coccyx (see Figure 8.12). The pelvis
has several important functions. Its primary role is to support the weight of the upper body when sitting and to transfer
this weight to the lower limbs when standing. It serves as an attachment point for trunk and lower limb muscles, and also
protects the internal pelvic organs. When standing in the anatomical position, the pelvis is tilted anteriorly. In this position,
the anterior superior iliac spines and the pubic tubercles lie in the same vertical plane, and the anterior (internal) surface of
the sacrum faces forward and downward.
