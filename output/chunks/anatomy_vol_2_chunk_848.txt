For an individual requiring a transplant, a matching donor is essential to prevent the immune system from destroying
the donor cells—a phenomenon known as tissue rejection. To treat patients with bone marrow transplants, it is first

cells are then intravenously infused. From the bloodstream, they establish themselves in the recipient’s bone marrow.
