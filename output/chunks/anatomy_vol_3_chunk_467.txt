Figure 25.8 Left Kidney

Renal Hilum

The renal hilum is the entry and exit site for structures servicing the kidneys: vessels, nerves, lymphatics, and ureters. The
medial-facing hila are tucked into the sweeping convex outline of the cortex. Emerging from the hilum is the renal pelvis,
which is formed from the major and minor calyxes in the kidney. The smooth muscle in the renal pelvis funnels urine via
peristalsis into the ureter. The renal arteries form directly from the descending aorta, whereas the renal veins return cleansed
blood directly to the inferior vena cava.
