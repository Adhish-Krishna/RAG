1162 CHAPTER 25 | THE URINARY SYSTEM

All systems of the body are interrelated. A change in one system may affect all other systems in the body, with mild to
devastating effects. A failure of urinary continence can be embarrassing and inconvenient, but is not life threatening. The
loss of other urinary functions may prove fatal. A failure to synthesize vitamin D is one such example.

 Vitamin D Synthesis

 In order for vitamin D to become active, it must undergo a hydroxylation reaction in the kidney, that is, an -OH group must
be added to calcidiol to make calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol).
