Figure 19.18 Conduction System of the Heart Specialized conducting components of the heart include the
sinoatrial node, the internodal pathways, the atrioventricular node, the atrioventricular bundle, the right and left bundle
branches, and the Purkinje fibers.

 Sinoatrial (SA) Node

Normal cardiac rhythm is established by the sinoatrial (SA) node, a specialized clump of myocardial conducting cel
located in the superior and posterior walls of the right atrium in close proximity to the orifice of the superior vena cava. The
SA node has the highest inherent rate of depolarization and is known as the pacemaker of the heart. It initiates the sinus
rhythm, or normal electrical pattern followed by contraction of the heart.

 This impulse spreads from its initiation in the SA node throughout the atria through specialized internodal pathways,
to the atrial myocardial contractile cells and the atrioventricular node.
