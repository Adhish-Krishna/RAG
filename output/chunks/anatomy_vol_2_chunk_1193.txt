The Cardiovascular Centers in the Brain

Neurological regulation of blood pressure and flow depends on the cardiovascular centers located in the medulla oblongata.

 This cluster of neurons responds to changes in blood pressure as well as blood concentrations of oxygen, carbon dioxide,

and hydrogen ions. The cardiovascular center contains three distinct paired components:

* The cardioaccelerator centers stimulate cardiac function by regulating heart rate and stroke volume via sympathetic
stimulation from the cardiac accelerator nerve.

* The cardioinhibitor centers slow cardiac function by decreasing heart rate and stroke volume via parasympathetic
stimulation from the vagus nerve.

 * The vasomotor centers control vessel tone or contraction of the smooth muscle in the tunica media. Changes in
diameter affect peripheral resistance, pressure, and flow, which affect cardiac output. The majority of these neurons
act via the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine from sympathetic neurons.

 Although each center functions independently, they are not anatomically distinct.
