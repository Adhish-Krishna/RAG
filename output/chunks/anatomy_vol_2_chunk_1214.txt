More importantly, it increases renal reabsorption of sodium and water, reducing water loss in urine output.
 The kidneys also increase the production of EPO, stimulating the formation of erythrocytes that not only deliver oxygen to
the tissues but also increase overall blood volume. Figure 20.21 summarizes the responses to loss of blood volume.

Circulatory Shock

The loss of too much blood may lead to circulatory shock, a life-threatening condition in which the circulatory system is
unable to maintain blood flow to adequately supply sufficient oxygen and other nutrients to the tissues to maintain cellular
metabolism.
