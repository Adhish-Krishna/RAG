Does spatial summation have to happen all at once, or can the separate signals arrive on the postsynaptic

neuron at slightly different times? Explain your answer.

 Synapses

There are two types of connections between electrically active cells, chemical synapses and electrical synapses. In a
chemical synapse, a chemical signal—namely, a neurotransmitter—is released from one cell and it affects the other cell.
 In an electrical synapse, there is a direct connection between the two cells so that ions can pass directly from one cell to
the next. If one cell is depolarized in an electrical synapse, the joined cell also depolarizes because the ions pass between
the cells. Chemical synapses involve the transmission of chemical information from one cell to the next. This section will
concentrate on the chemical type of synapse.

 An example of a chemical synapse is the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) described in the chapter on muscle tissue. In

the nervous system, there are many more synapses that are essentially the same as the NMJ.
