The spinothalamic tract also begins with neurons in a dorsal root ganglion. These neurons extend their axons to the
dorsal horn, where they synapse with the second neuron in their respective pathway. The name “spinothalamic” comes from
this second neuron, which has its cell body in the spinal cord gray matter and connects to the thalamus. Axons from these
second neurons then decussate within the spinal cord and ascend to the brain and enter the thalamus, where each synapses
with the third neuron in its respective pathway. The neurons in the thalamus then project their axons to the spinothalamic
tract, which synapses in the postcentral gyrus of the cerebral cortex.

These two systems are similar in that they both begin with dorsal root ganglion cells, as with most general sensory
information. The dorsal column system is primarily responsible for touch sensations and proprioception, whereas the
spinothalamic tract pathway is primarily responsible for pain and temperature sensations.
