These ligaments help to strengthen the superior and anterior capsule walls.

 However, the primary support for the shoulder joint is provided by muscles crossing the joint, particularly the four
rotator cuff muscles. These muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis) arise from the scapula and
attach to the greater or lesser tubercles of the humerus. As these muscles cross the shoulder joint, their tendons encircle the
head of the humerus and become fused to the anterior, superior, and posterior walls of the articular capsule. The thickening
of the capsule formed by the fusion of these four muscle tendons is called the rotator cuff. Two bursae, the subacromial
bursa and the subscapular bursa, help to prevent friction between the rotator cuff muscle tendons and the scapula as
these tendons cross the glenohumeral joint. In addition to their individual actions of moving the upper limb, the rotator
cuff muscles also serve to hold the head of the humerus in position within the glenoid cavity.
