The peritoneal cavity is the space bounded by the visceral and parietal peritoneal surfaces. A few milliliters of watery
fluid act as a lubricant to minimize friction between the serosal surfaces of the peritoneum.

Digestive System: Peritonitis

Inflammation of the peritoneum is called peritonitis. Chemical peritonitis can develop any time the wall of the
alimentary canal is breached, allowing the contents of the lumen entry into the peritoneal cavity. For example, when
an ulcer perforates the stomach wall, gastric juices spill into the peritoneal cavity. Hemorrhagic peritonitis occurs
after a ruptured tubal pregnancy or traumatic injury to the liver or spleen fills the peritoneal cavity with blood.
