The motor end-plate
is the location of the ACh-receptors in the muscle fiber sarcolemma. When ACh molecules are released, they diffuse
across a minute space called the synaptic cleft and bind to the receptors.

 The motor neurons that tell the skeletal muscle fibers to contract originate in the spinal cord, with a smaller number
located in the brainstem for activation of skeletal muscles of the face, head, and neck. These neurons have long processes,

called axons, which are specialized to transmit action potentials long distancesâ€” in this case, all the way from the spinal
cord to the muscle itself (which may be up to three feet away). The axons of multiple neurons bundle together to form
nerves, like wires bundled together in a cable.

 Signaling begins when a neuronal action potential travels along the axon of a motor neuron, and then along
the individual branches to terminate at the NMJ.
