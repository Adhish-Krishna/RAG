In this case, the patient’s blood is normally diverted to an artificial heart-
lung machine to maintain the body’s blood supply and gas exchange until the surgery is complete, and sinus rhythm can
be restored. Excessive hyperthermia and hypothermia will both result in death, as enzymes drive the body systems to cease
normal function, beginning with the central nervous system.

 Stroke Volume

Many of the same factors that regulate HR also impact cardiac function by altering SV. While a number of variables are
involved, SV is ultimately dependent upon the difference between EDV and ESV. The three primary factors to consider are
preload, or the stretch on the ventricles prior to contraction; the contractility, or the force or strength of the contraction itself;
and afterload, the force the ventricles must generate to pump blood against the resistance in the vessels.
