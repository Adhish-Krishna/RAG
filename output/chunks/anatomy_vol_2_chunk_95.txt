 he charge of the ion.

 Channels for cations (positive ions) will have negatively charged side chains in the pore. Channels for anions (negative ions)
will have positively charged side chains in the pore. This is called electrochemical exclusion, meaning that the channel

pore is charge-specific.

 Ions can also be specified by the diameter of the pore. The distance between the amino acids will be specific for
the diameter of the ion when it dissociates from the water molecules surrounding it. Because of the surrounding water
molecules, larger pores are not ideal for smaller ions because the water molecules will interact, by hydrogen bonds, more
readily than the amino acid side chains.
