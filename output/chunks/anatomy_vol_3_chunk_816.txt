Can you identify when neurulation occurs in the embryo?

28.3 | Fetal Development

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Differentiate between the embryonic period and the fetal period
 ¢ Briefly describe the process of sexual differentiation
¢ Describe the fetal circulatory system and explain the role of the shunts
* Trace the development of a fetus from the end of the embryonic period to birth

As you will recall, a developing human is called a fetus from the ninth week of gestation until birth. This 30-week period of
development is marked by continued cell growth and differentiation, which fully develop the structures and functions of the
immature organ systems formed during the embryonic period. The completion of fetal development results in a newborn
who, although still immature in many ways, is capable of survival outside the womb.

Sexual differentiation does not begin until the fetal period, during weeks 9-12.
