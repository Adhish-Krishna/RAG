The inferior limit of the lesser pelvic cavity is called the pelvic outlet. This large opening is defined by
the inferior margin of the pubic symphysis anteriorly, and the ischiopubic ramus, the ischial tuberosity, the sacrotuberous
ligament, and the inferior tip of the coccyx posteriorly. Because of the anterior tilt of the pelvis, the lesser pelvis is also
angled, giving it an anterosuperior (pelvic inlet) to posteroinferior (pelvic outlet) orientation.

 Female Male

Figure 8.15 Male and Female Pelvis The female pelvis is adapted for childbirth and is broader, with a larger subpubic
angle, a rounder pelvic brim, and a wider and more shallow lesser pelvic cavity than the male pelvis.

 Comparison of the Female and Male Pelvis

The differences between the adult female and male pelvis relate to function and body size. In general, the bones of the male
pelvis are thicker and heavier, adapted for support of the maleâ€™s heavier physical build and stronger muscles.
