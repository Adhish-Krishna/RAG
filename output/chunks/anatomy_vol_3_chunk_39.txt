Figure 22.12 Normal and Bronchial Asthma Tissues (a) Normal lung tissue does not have the characteristics
of lung tissue during (b) an asthma attack, which include thickened mucosa, increased mucus-producing goblet
cells, and eosinophil infiltrates.

 Symptoms of an asthma attack involve coughing, shortness of breath, wheezing, and tightness of the chest.
 Symptoms of a severe asthma attack that requires immediate medical attention would include difficulty breathing that
results in blue (cyanotic) lips or face, confusion, drowsiness, a rapid pulse, sweating, and severe anxiety. The severity
of the condition, frequency of attacks, and identified triggers influence the type of medication that an individual may
require. Longer-term treatments are used for those with more severe asthma. Short-term, fast-acting drugs that are
used to treat an asthma attack are typically administered via an inhaler.
