Tendons also become stronger to prevent tendon damage, as the force produced by muscles is
transferred to tendons that attach the muscle to bone.

 For effective strength training, the intensity of the exercise must continually be increased. For instance, continued
weight lifting without increasing the weight of the load does not increase muscle size. To produce ever-greater results, the
weights lifted must become increasingly heavier, making it more difficult for muscles to move the load. The muscle then
adapts to this heavier load, and an even heavier load must be used if even greater muscle mass is desired.

 f done improperly, resistance training can lead to overuse injuries of the muscle, tendon, or bone. These injuries can
occur if the load is too heavy or if the muscles are not given sufficient time between workouts to recover or if joints are not
aligned properly during the exercises.
