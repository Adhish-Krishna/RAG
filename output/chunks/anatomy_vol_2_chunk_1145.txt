This includes repair and replacement of diseased or damaged vessels, removal of plaque from
vessels, minimally invasive procedures including the insertion of venous catheters, and traditional surgery. Following
completion of medical school, the physician generally completes a 5-year surgical residency followed by an additional
1 to 2 years of vascular specialty training. In the United States, most vascular surgeons are members of the Society of
Vascular Surgery.

 Vascular technicians are specialists in imaging technologies that provide information on the health of the vascular
system. They may also assist physicians in treating disorders involving the arteries and veins. This profession
often overlaps with cardiovascular technology, which would also include treatments involving the heart. Although
recognized by the American Medical Association, there are currently no licensing requirements for vascular
technicians, and licensing is voluntary. Vascular technicians typically have an Associateâ€™s degree or certificate,
involving 18 months to 2 years of training. The United States Bureau of Labor projects this profession to grow by 29
percent from 2010 to 2020.
