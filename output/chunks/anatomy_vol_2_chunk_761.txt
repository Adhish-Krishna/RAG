These
hormones are essential for fluid and electrolyte balance.

 Aldosterone is the major mineralocorticoid. It is important in the regulation of the concentration of sodium and

potassium ions in urine, sweat, and saliva. For example, it is released in response to elevated blood K’, low blood Na’, low

blood pressure, or low blood volume. In response, aldosterone increases the excretion of K* and the retention of Na‘, which
in turn increases blood volume and blood pressure. Its secretion is prompted when CRH from the hypothalamus triggers
ACTH release from the anterior pituitary.

 Aldosterone is also a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in which specialized cells
of the kidneys secrete the enzyme renin in response to low blood volume or low blood pressure. Renin then catalyzes
the conversion of the blood protein angiotensinogen, produced by the liver, to the hormone angiotensin I. Angiotensin
I is converted in the lungs to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).
