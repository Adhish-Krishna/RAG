Proteins called pore complexes lining the nuclear pores regulate the passage of materials into
and out of the nucleus.
 Inside the nuclear envelope is a gel-like nucleoplasm with solutes that include the building blocks of nucleic acids.
 here also can be a dark-staining mass often visible under a simple light microscope, called a nucleolus (plural = nucleoli).
 he nucleolus is a region of the nucleus that is responsible for manufacturing the RNA necessary for construction of
ribosomes. Once synthesized, newly made ribosomal subunits exit the cellâ€™s nucleus through the nuclear pores.
 The genetic instructions that are used to build and maintain an organism are arranged in an orderly manner in strands
of DNA. Within the nucleus are threads of chromatin composed of DNA and associated proteins (Figure 3.22). Along the
chromatin threads, the DNA is wrapped around a set of histone proteins. A nucleosome is a single, wrapped DNA-histone
complex. Multiple nucleosomes along the entire molecule of DNA appear like a beaded necklace, in which the string is
the DNA and the beads are the associated histones.
