In accounting for the total number of ATP produced per
glucose molecule through aerobic respiration, it is important to remember the following points:

* A net of two ATP are produced through glycolysis (four produced and two consumed during the energy-consuming
stage). However, these two ATP are used for transporting the NADH produced during glycolysis from the cytoplasm
into the mitochondria. Therefore, the net production of ATP during glycolysis is zero.

 ¢ In all phases after glycolysis, the number of ATP, NADH, and FADH?2 produced must be multiplied by two to reflect
how each glucose molecule produces two pyruvate molecules.

¢ Inthe ETC, about three ATP are produced for every oxidized NADH. However, only about two ATP are produced for
every oxidized FADH2. The electrons from FADH2 produce less ATP, because they start at a lower point in the ETC
(Complex II) compared to the electrons from NADH (Complex 1) (see Figure 24.8).
