Hinge
joints, such as at the elbow, knee, ankle, or interphalangeal joints between phalanx bones of the fingers and toes, allow only
or bending and straightening of the joint. Pivot and hinge joints are functionally classified as uniaxial joints.

 Condyloid joints are found where the shallow depression of one bone receives a rounded bony area formed by one or

two bones. Condyloid joints are found at the base of the fingers (metacarpophalangeal joints) and at the wrist (radiocarpal
joint). At a saddle joint, the articulating bones fit together like a rider and a saddle. An example is the first carpometacarpal
joint located at the base of the thumb. Both condyloid and saddle joints are functionally classified as biaxial joints.
 Plane joints are formed between the small, flattened surfaces of adjacent bones. These joints allow the bones to slide
or rotate against each other, but the range of motion is usually slight and tightly limited by ligaments or surrounding bones.
