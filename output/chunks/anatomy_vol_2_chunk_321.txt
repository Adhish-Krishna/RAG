If no axons are in place within the olfactory
nerve, then the axons from newly formed olfactory neurons have no guide to lead them to their connections within
the olfactory bulb. There are temporary causes of anosmia, as well, such as those caused by inflammatory responses
related to respiratory infections or allergies.

 Loss of the sense of smell can result in food tasting bland. A person with an impaired sense of smell may require
additional spice and seasoning levels for food to be tasted. Anosmia may also be related to some presentations of mild
depression, because the loss of enjoyment of food may lead to a general sense of despair.

 The ability of olfactory neurons to replace themselves decreases with age, leading to age-related anosmia. This
explains why some elderly people salt their food more than younger people do. However, this increased sodium intake
can increase blood volume and blood pressure, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases in the elderly.

Audition (Hearing)

Hearing, or audition, is the transduction of sound waves into a neural signal that is made possible by the structures of
the ear (Figure 14.5).
