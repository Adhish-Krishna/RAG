Each new DNA molecule contains one strand from the original molecule and one newly synthesized strand. The term
for this mode of replication is “semiconservative,” because half of the original DNA molecule is conserved in each new
DNA molecule. This process continues until the cell’s entire genome, the entire complement of an organism’s DNA, is
replicated. As you might imagine, it is very important that DNA replication take place precisely so that new cells in the body
contain the exact same genetic material as their parent cells. Mistakes made during DNA replication, such as the accidental
addition of an inappropriate nucleotide, have the potential to render a gene dysfunctional or useless. Fortunately, there are
mechanisms in place to minimize such mistakes. A DNA proofreading process enlists the help of special enzymes that scan
the newly synthesized molecule for mistakes and corrects them. Once the process of DNA replication is complete, the cell
is ready to divide.
