Each muscle is wrapped in a sheath of dense, irregular connective tissue called the epimysium,
which allows a muscle to contract and move powerfully while maintaining its structural integrity. The epimysium also
separates muscle from other tissues and organs in the area, allowing the muscle to move independently.

Figure 10.3 The Three Connective Tissue Layers Bundles of muscle fibers, called fascicles, are covered by the
perimysium. Muscle fibers are covered by the endomysium.

 Inside each skeletal muscle, muscle fibers are organized into individual bundles, each called a fascicle, by a middle
layer of connective tissue called the perimysium. This fascicular organization is common in muscles of the limbs; it allows
the nervous system to trigger a specific movement of a muscle by activating a subset of muscle fibers within a bundle,
or fascicle of the muscle.
