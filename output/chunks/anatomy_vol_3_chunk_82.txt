For example, although nitrogen is present
in the atmosphere, very little nitrogen dissolves into the blood, because the solubility of nitrogen in blood is very low. The
exception to this occurs in scuba divers; the composition of the compressed air that divers breathe causes nitrogen to have a
higher partial pressure than normal, causing it to dissolve in the blood in greater amounts than normal. Too much nitrogen
in the bloodstream results in a serious condition that can be fatal if not corrected. Gas molecules establish an equilibrium
between those molecules dissolved in liquid and those in air.

 The composition of air in the atmosphere and in the alveoli differs. In both cases, the relative concentration of gases
is nitrogen > oxygen > water vapor > carbon dioxide. The amount of water vapor present in alveolar air is greater than
that in atmospheric air (Table 22.3). Recall that the respiratory system works to humidify incoming air, thereby causing the
air present in the alveoli to have a greater amount of water vapor than atmospheric air.
