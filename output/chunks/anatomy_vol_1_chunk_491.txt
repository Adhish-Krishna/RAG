This leads to a loss of color in patches (Figure 5.10).
 Neither albinism nor vitiligo directly affects the lifespan of an individual.

skin. The condition is especially noticeable on darker skin. (credit: Klaus D. Peter)

Other changes in the appearance of skin coloration can be indicative of diseases associated with other body
systems. Liver disease or liver cancer can cause the accumulation of bile and the yellow pigment bilirubin, leading
to the skin appearing yellow or jaundiced (jaune is the French word for “yellow”). Tumors of the pituitary gland can
result in the secretion of large amounts of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), which results in a darkening of
the skin. Similarly, Addison’s disease can stimulate the release of excess amounts of adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH), which can give the skin a deep bronze color.
