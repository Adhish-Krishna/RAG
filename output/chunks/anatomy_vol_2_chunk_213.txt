If you are walking along the sidewalk on campus and you hear chirping, the superior colliculus coordinates
that information with your awareness of the visual location of the tree right above you. That is the correlation of auditory
and visual maps. If you suddenly feel something wet fall on your head, your superior colliculus integrates that with the
auditory and visual maps and you know that the chirping bird just relieved itself on you. You want to look up to see the
culprit, but do not.

 The tegmentum is continuous with the gray matter of the rest of the brain stem. Throughout the midbrain, pons, and
medulla, the tegmentum contains the nuclei that receive and send information through the cranial nerves, as well as regions
that regulate important functions such as those of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.
