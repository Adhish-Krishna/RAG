Short chains of two amino
acids (dipeptides) or three amino acids (tripeptides) are also transported actively. However, after they enter the absorptive
epithelial cells, they are broken down into their amino acids before leaving the cell and entering the capillary blood via
diffusion.

 Lipid Absorption

About 95 percent of lipids are absorbed in the small intestine. Bile salts not only speed up lipid digestion, they are also
essential to the absorption of the end products of lipid digestion. Short-chain fatty acids are relatively water soluble and can
enter the absorptive cells (enterocytes) directly. Despite being hydrophobic, the small size of short-chain fatty acids enables
them to be absorbed by enterocytes via simple diffusion, and then take the same path as monosaccharides and amino acids
into the blood capillary of a villus.
