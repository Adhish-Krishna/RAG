Part of the power of the neurological exam is this link between structure and function. Testing the various functions
represented in the exam allows an accurate estimation of where the nervous system may be damaged. Consider the patient
described in the chapter introduction. In the emergency department, he is given a quick exam to find where the deficit may
be localized. Knowledge of where the damage occurred will lead to the most effective therapy.

 In rapid succession, he is asked to smile, raise his eyebrows, stick out his tongue, and shrug his shoulders. The doctor
tests muscular strength by providing resistance against his arms and legs while he tries to lift them. With his eyes closed,
he has to indicate when he feels the tip of a pen touch his legs, arms, fingers, and face. He follows the tip of a pen as the
doctor moves it through the visual field and finally toward his face.
