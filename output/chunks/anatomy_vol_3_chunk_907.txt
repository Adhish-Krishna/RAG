Contractions serve to dilate the cervix and expel the newborn. Delivery of the placenta
and associated fetal membranes follows.

 28.5 Adjustments of the Infant at Birth and Postnatal Stages

The first breath a newborn takes at birth inflates the lungs and dramatically alters the circulatory system, closing the three
shunts that directed oxygenated blood away from the lungs and liver during fetal life. Clamping and cutting the umbilical
cord collapses the three umbilical blood vessels. The proximal umbilical arteries remain a part of the circulatory system,
whereas the distal umbilical arteries and the umbilical vein become fibrotic. The newborn keeps warm by breaking down
brown adipose tissue in the process of nonshivering thermogenesis. The first consumption of breast milk or formula floods
the newbornâ€™s sterile gastrointestinal tract with beneficial bacteria that eventually establish themselves as the bacterial flora,
which aid in digestion.

28.6 Lactation

The lactating mother supplies all the hydration and nutrients that a growing infant needs for the first 4-6 months of life.
