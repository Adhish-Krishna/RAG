Its hormones regulate basa
metabolism, oxygen use, nutrient metabolism, the production of ATP, and calcium homeostasis. They also contribute to
protein synthesis and the normal growth and development of body tissues, including maturation of the nervous system, and
they increase the bodyâ€™s sensitivity to catecholamines. The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are
produced and secreted by the thyroid gland in response to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary.
 Synthesis of the amino acid-derived T3 and T4 hormones requires iodine. Insufficient amounts of iodine in the diet can lead
to goiter, cretinism, and many other disorders.

 17.5 The Parathyroid Glands

Calcium is required for a variety of important physiologic processes, including neuromuscular functioning; thus, blood
calcium levels are closely regulated. The parathyroid glands are small structures located on the posterior thyroid gland that
produce parathyroid hormone (PTH), which regulates blood calcium levels.
