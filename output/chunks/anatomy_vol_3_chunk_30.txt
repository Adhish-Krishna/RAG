The size of the membranous folds of the
true vocal cords differs between individuals, producing voices with different pitch ranges. Folds in males tend to be larger
than those in females, which create a deeper voice. The act of swallowing causes the pharynx and larynx to lift upward,
allowing the pharynx to expand and the epiglottis of the larynx to swing downward, closing the opening to the trachea.
 These movements produce a larger area for food to pass through, while preventing food and beverages from entering the
trachea.
