Figure 11.23 Muscles That Move the Humerus (a, c) The muscles that move the humerus anteriorly are generally
located on the anterior side of the body and originate from the sternum (e.g., pectoralis major) or the anterior side of the
scapula (e.g., subscapularis). (b) The muscles that move the humerus superiorly generally originate from the superior
surfaces of the scapula and/or the clavicle (e.g., deltoids). The muscles that move the humerus inferiorly generally
originate from middle or lower back (e.g., latissiumus dorsi). (d) The muscles that move the humerus posteriorly are
generally located on the posterior side of the body and insert into the scapula (e.g., infraspinatus).
