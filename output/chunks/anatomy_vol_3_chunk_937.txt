Ultimately,
some of these ectodermal cells become further restricted and differentiate in to nerve cells. 34 Synovial membranes are a type
of connective tissue membrane that supports mobility in joints. The membrane lines the joint cavity and contains fibroblasts that
produce hyaluronan, which leads to the production of synovial fluid, a natural lubricant that enables the bones of a joint to move
freely against one another. 35 Columnar epithelia, which form the lining of the digestive tract, can be either simple or stratified.
 The cells are long and narrow. The nucleus is elongated and located on the basal side of the cell. Ciliated columnar epithelium is
composed of simple columnar epithelial cells that display cilia on their apical surfaces. 36 Blood is a fluid connective tissue, a
variety of specialized cells that circulate in a watery fluid containing salts, nutrients, and dissolved proteins in a liquid extracellular
matrix.
