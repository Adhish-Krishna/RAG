An example already mentioned is in
Mycobactrium tuberculosis, which has evolved a complex cell wall that is resistant to the digestive enzymes of the
macrophages that ingest them, and thus persists in the host, causing the chronic disease tuberculosis. This section briefly
summarizes other ways in which pathogens can “outwit” immune responses. But keep in mind, although it seems as if
pathogens have a will of their own, they do not. All of these evasive “strategies” arose strictly by evolution, driven by
selection.

 Bacteria sometimes evade immune responses because they exist in multiple strains, such as different groups of
Staphylococcus aureus. S. aureus is commonly found in minor skin infections, such as boils, and some healthy people
harbor it in their nose. One small group of strains of this bacterium, however, called methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus, has become resistant to multiple antibiotics and is essentially untreatable.
