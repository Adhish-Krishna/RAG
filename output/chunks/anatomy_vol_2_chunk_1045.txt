Compare atrial and ventricular systole and diastole
¢ Relate heart sounds detected by auscultation to action of heart’s valves

The period of time that begins with contraction of the atria and ends with ventricular relaxation is known as the cardiac
cycle (Figure 19.27). The period of contraction that the heart undergoes while it pumps blood into circulation is called
systole. The period of relaxation that occurs as the chambers fill with blood is called diastole. Both the atria and ventricles
undergo systole and diastole, and it is essential that these components be carefully regulated and coordinated to ensure blood
is pumped efficiently to the body.

 Figure 19.27 Overview of the Cardiac Cycle The cardiac cycle begins with atrial systole and progresses to
ventricular systole, atrial diastole, and ventricular diastole, when the cycle begins again. Correlations to the ECG are
highlighted.

 Pressures and Flow

Fluids, whether gases or liquids, are materials that flow according to pressure gradients—that is, they move from regions
that are higher in pressure to regions that are lower in pressure.
