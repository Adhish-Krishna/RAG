 Collecting Ducts and Recovery of Water

Solutes move across the membranes of the collecting ducts, which contain two distinct cell types, principal cells and
intercalated cells. A principal cell possesses channels for the recovery or loss of sodium and potassium. An intercalated
cell secretes or absorbs acid or bicarbonate. As in other portions of the nephron, there is an array of micromachines (pumps
and channels) on display in the membranes of these cells.
 Regulation of urine volume and osmolarity are major functions of the collecting ducts. By varying the amount of water
that is recovered, the collecting ducts play a major role in maintaining the body’s normal osmolarity. If the blood becomes
hyperosmotic, the collecting ducts recover more water to dilute the blood; if the blood becomes hyposmotic, the collecting
ducts recover less of the water, leading to concentration of the blood.
