One-way valves (semi-lunar valves) in lymphatic vessels keep the lymph moving toward

the heart. Lymph flows from the lymphatic capillaries, through lymphatic vessels, and then is dumped into the circulatory
system via the lymphatic ducts located at the junction of the jugular and subclavian veins in the neck.
 Lymphatic Capillaries

Lymphatic capillaries, also called the terminal lymphatics, are vessels where interstitial fluid enters the lymphatic system
to become lymph fluid. Located in almost every tissue in the body, these vessels are interlaced among the arterioles and
venules of the circulatory system in the soft connective tissues of the body (Figure 21.3). Exceptions are the central nervous
system, bone marrow, bones, teeth, and the cornea of the eye, which do not contain lymph vessels.
