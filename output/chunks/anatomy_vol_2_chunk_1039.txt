Also note
that the P waves are not followed
by the QRS complex.

 Question: What would you expect
(e) Third-degree block to happen to heart rate (pulse)?

 Figure 19.25 Common ECG Abnormalities (a) In a second-degree or partial block, one-half of the P waves
are not followed by the QRS complex and T waves while the other half are. (b) In atrial fibrillation, the electrical
pattern is abnormal prior to the QRS complex, and the frequency between the QRS complexes has increased.
 (c) In ventricular tachycardia, the shape of the QRS complex is abnormal. (d) In ventricular fibrillation, there is no
normal electrical activity. (e) In a third-degree block, there is no correlation between atrial activity (the P wave) and
ventricular activity (the QRS complex).
