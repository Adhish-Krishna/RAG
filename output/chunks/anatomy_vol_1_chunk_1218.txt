The plantaris
tendon is a desirable substitute for the fascia lata in hernia repair, tendon transplants, and repair of ligaments. There are
four deep muscles in the posterior compartment of the leg as well: the popliteus, flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis
longus, and tibialis posterior.

 The foot also has intrinsic muscles, which originate and insert within it (similar to the intrinsic muscles of the hand).
 These muscles primarily provide support for the foot and its arch, and contribute to movements of the toes (Figure 11.34
and Figure 11.35). The principal support for the longitudinal arch of the foot is a deep fascia called plantar aponeurosis,
which runs from the calcaneus bone to the toes (inflammation of this tissue is the cause of “plantar fasciitis,” which can
affect runners.
