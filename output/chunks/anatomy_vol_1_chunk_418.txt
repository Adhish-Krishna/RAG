A large number of
capillaries allow rapid storage and mobilization of lipid molecules. White adipose tissue is most abundant. It can appear
yellow and owes its color to carotene and related pigments from plant food. White fat contributes mostly to lipid storage
and can serve as insulation from cold temperatures and mechanical injuries. White adipose tissue can be found protecting
the kidneys and cushioning the back of the eye. Brown adipose tissue is more common in infants, hence the term “baby
fat.” In adults, there is a reduced amount of brown fat and it is found mainly in the neck and clavicular regions of the body.
 The many mitochondria in the cytoplasm of brown adipose tissue help explain its efficiency at metabolizing stored fat.
 Brown adipose tissue is thermogenic, meaning that as it breaks down fats, it releases metabolic heat, rather than producing
adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a key molecule used in metabolism.
