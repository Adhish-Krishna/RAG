7 If blood could not get to the middle cerebral artery through the posterior circulation, the
blood would flow around the circle of Willis to reach that artery from an anterior vessel. Blood flow would just reverse within
the circle. 8 The spinal cord ends in the upper lumbar area of the vertebral column, so a needle inserted lower than that will not
damage the nervous tissue of the CNS. 9 The choroid plexuses of the ventricles make CSF. As shown, there is a little of the
blue color appearing in each ventricle that is joined by the color flowing from the other ventricles. 10 Figure 13.20 They derive
from the neural crest. 11 Figure 13.22 The endoneurium surrounding individual nerve fibers is comparable to the endomysium
surrounding myofibrils, the perineurium bundling axons into fascicles is comparable to the perimysium bundling muscle fibers into
fascicles, and the epineurium surrounding the whole nerve is comparable to the epimysium surrounding the muscle.
