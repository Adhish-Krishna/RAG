The stereocilia are an array of microvilli-like structures arranged from tallest to shortest. Protein
fibers tether adjacent hairs together within each array, such that the array will bend in response to movements of the basilar

membrane. The stereocilia extend up from the hair cells to the overlying tectorial membrane, which is attached medially
to the organ of Corti. When the pressure waves from the scala move the basilar membrane, the tectorial membrane slides
across the stereocilia. This bends the stereocilia either toward or away from the tallest member of each array. When the
stereocilia bend toward the tallest member of their array, tension in the protein tethers opens ion channels in the hair cell
membrane. This will depolarize the hair cell membrane, triggering nerve impulses that travel down the afferent nerve fibers
attached to the hair cells. When the stereocilia bend toward the shortest member of their array, the tension on the tethers
slackens and the ion channels close.
