You ingest these in plant and animal foods and beverages, and the digestive
system breaks them down into molecules small enough to be absorbed. The breakdown products of carbohydrates and lipids
can then be used in the metabolic processes that convert them to ATP. Although you might feel as if you are starving after
missing a single meal, you can survive without consuming the energy-yielding nutrients for at least several weeks.

 Water and the energy-yielding nutrients are also referred to as macronutrients because the body needs them in
large amounts. In contrast, micronutrients are vitamins and minerals. These elements and compounds participate in many
essential chemical reactions and processes, such nerve impulses, and some, such as calcium, also contribute to the bodyâ€™s
structure. Your body can store some of the micronutrients in its tissues, and draw on those reserves if you fail to consume
them in your diet for a few days or weeks.
