 Figure 15.10 Pupillary Reflex Pathways The pupil is under competing autonomic control in response to light levels
hitting the retina. The sympathetic system will dilate the pupil when the retina is not receiving enough light, and the
parasympathetic system will constrict the pupil when too much light hits the retina.

 Forebrain Structures

Autonomic control is based on the visceral reflexes, composed of the afferent and efferent branches. These homeostatic
mechanisms are based on the balance between the two divisions of the autonomic system, which results in tone for various
organs that is based on the predominant input from the sympathetic or parasympathetic systems.
