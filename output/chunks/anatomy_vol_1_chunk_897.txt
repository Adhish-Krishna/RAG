The bones of the joint articulate with each other within the joint cavity.

 Friction between the bones at a synovial joint is prevented by the presence of the articular cartilage, a thin layer
of hyaline cartilage that covers the entire articulating surface of each bone. However, unlike at a cartilaginous joint, the

articular cartilages of each bone are not continuous with each other. Instead, the articular cartilage acts like a Teflon®
coating over the bone surface, allowing the articulating bones to move smoothly against each other without damaging the
underlying bone tissue. Lining the inner surface of the articular capsule is a thin synovial membrane. The cells of this
membrane secrete synovial fluid (synovia = “a thick fluid”), a thick, slimy fluid that provides lubrication to further reduce
friction between the bones of the joint. This fluid also provides nourishment to the articular cartilage, which does not contain
blood vessels. The ability of the bones to move smoothly against each other within the joint cavity, and the freedom of joint
movement this provides, means that each synovial joint is functionally classified as a diarthrosis.
