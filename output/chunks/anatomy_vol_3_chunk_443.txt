Because the glomeruli filter the blood based mostly
on particle size, large elements like blood cells, platelets, antibodies, and albumen are excluded. The glomerulus is the first
part of the nephron, which then continues as a highly specialized tubular structure responsible for creating the final urine
composition. All other solutes, such as ions, amino acids, vitamins, and wastes, are filtered to create a filtrate composition
very similar to plasma. The glomeruli create about 200 liters (189 quarts) of this filtrate every day, yet you excrete less than
two liters of waste you call urine.

 Characteristics of the urine change, depending on influences such as water intake, exercise, environmental temperature,
nutrient intake, and other factors (Table 25.1). Some of the characteristics such as color and odor are rough descriptors of
your state of hydration. For example, if you exercise or work outside, and sweat a great deal, your urine will turn darker and
produce a slight odor, even if you drink plenty of water.
