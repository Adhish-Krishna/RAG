The appendix
(or vermiform appendix) is a winding tube that attaches to the cecum. Although the 7.6-cm (3-in) long appendix contains
lymphoid tissue, suggesting an immunologic function, this organ is generally considered vestigial. However, at least one
recent report postulates a survival advantage conferred by the appendix: In diarrheal illness, the appendix may serve as a
bacterial reservoir to repopulate the enteric bacteria for those surviving the initial phases of the illness. Moreover, its twisted
anatomy provides a haven for the accumulation and multiplication of enteric bacteria. The mesoappendix, the mesentery
of the appendix, tethers it to the mesentery of the ileum.

 Colon

The cecum blends seamlessly with the colon. Upon entering the colon, the food residue first travels up the ascending colon
on the right side of the abdomen. At the inferior surface of the liver, the colon bends to form the right colic flexure (hepatic
flexure) and becomes the transverse colon.
