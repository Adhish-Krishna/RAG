Children will get
sick anyway, and the later benefits of immunological memory far outweigh the minor discomforts of most childhood
diseases. In fact, getting diseases such as chickenpox or measles later in life is much harder on the adult and are
associated with symptoms significantly worse than those seen in the childhood illnesses. Of course, vaccinations help
children avoid some illnesses, but there are so many pathogens, we will never be immune to them all.

 Could over-cleanliness be the reason that allergies are increasing in more developed countries? Some scientists
think so. Allergies are based on an IgE antibody response. Many scientists think the system evolved to help the body
rid itself of worm parasites. The hygiene theory is the idea that the immune system is geared to respond to antigens,
and if pathogens are not present, it will respond instead to inappropriate antigens such as allergens and self-antigens.
