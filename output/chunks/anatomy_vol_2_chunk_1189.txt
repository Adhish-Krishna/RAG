Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/capillaryfunct) to explore capillaries and how they function in the
body. Capillaries are never more than 100 micrometers away. What is the main component of interstitial fluid?

20.4 | Homeostatic Regulation of the Vascular System

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Discuss the mechanisms involved in the neural regulation of vascular homeostasis
Â¢ Describe the contribution of a variety of hormones to the renal regulation of blood pressure
* Identify the effects of exercise on vascular homeostasis
* Discuss how hypertension, hemorrhage, and circulatory shock affect vascular health

 In order to maintain homeostasis in the cardiovascular system and provide adequate blood to the tissues, blood flow must
be redirected continually to the tissues as they become more active. In a very real sense, the cardiovascular system engages
in resource allocation, because there is not enough blood flow to distribute blood equally to all tissues simultaneously.
