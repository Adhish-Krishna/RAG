Secondary production and maturation of lymphocytes
occurs in specific regions of lymphatic tissue known as germinal centers. Lymphocytes are fully capable of mitosis and may
produce clones of cells with identical properties. This capacity enables an individual to maintain immunity throughout life
to many threats that have been encountered in the past.

 Disorders of Leukocytes

Leukopenia is a condition in which too few leukocytes are produced. If this condition is pronounced, the individual may
be unable to ward off disease. Excessive leukocyte proliferation is known as leukocytosis. Although leukocyte counts are
high, the cells themselves are often nonfunctional, leaving the individual at increased risk for disease.

 Leukemia is a cancer involving an abundance of leukocytes. It may involve only one specific type of leukocyte from
either the myeloid line (myelocytic leukemia) or the lymphoid line (lymphocytic leukemia). In chronic leukemia, mature
leukocytes accumulate and fail to die. In acute leukemia, there is an overproduction of young, immature leukocytes.
