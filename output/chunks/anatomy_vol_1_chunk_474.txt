A keratinocyte is a cell that
manufactures and stores the protein keratin. Keratin is an intracellular fibrous protein that gives hair, nails, and skin their
hardness and water-resistant properties. The keratinocytes in the stratum corneum are dead and regularly slough away, being
replaced by cells from the deeper layers (Figure 5.4).

Figure 5.4 Epidermis The epidermis is epithelium composed of multiple layers of cells. The basal layer consists of
cuboidal cells, whereas the outer layers are squamous, keratinized cells, so the whole epithelium is often described
as being keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. LM x 40. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of

Stratum Basale

The stratum basale (also called the stratum germinativum) is the deepest epidermal layer and attaches the epidermis to the
basal lamina, below which lie the layers of the dermis.
