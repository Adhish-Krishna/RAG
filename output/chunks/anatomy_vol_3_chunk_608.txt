Sodium

Sodium is the major cation of the extracellular fluid. It is responsible for one-half of the osmotic pressure gradient that exists
between the interior of cells and their surrounding environment. People eating a typical Western diet, which is very high
in NaCl, routinely take in 130 to 160 mmol/day of sodium, but humans require only 1 to 2 mmol/day. This excess sodium
appears to be a major factor in hypertension (high blood pressure) in some people. Excretion of sodium is accomplished
primarily by the kidneys. Sodium is freely filtered through the glomerular capillaries of the kidneys, and although much of
the filtered sodium is reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule, some remains in the filtrate and urine, and is normally
excreted.
