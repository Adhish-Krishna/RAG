The name
comes from the fact that this system is outside the corticospinal pathway, which includes the pyramids in the medulla. A
few pathways originating from the brain stem contribute to this system.

 The tectospinal tract projects from the midbrain to the spinal cord and is important for postural movements that are
driven by the superior colliculus. The name of the tract comes from an alternate name for the superior colliculus, which is
the tectum. The reticulospinal tract connects the reticular system, a diffuse region of gray matter in the brain stem, with
the spinal cord. This tract influences trunk and proximal limb muscles related to posture and locomotion. The reticulospinal
tract also contributes to muscle tone and influences autonomic functions. The vestibulospinal tract connects the brain stem
nuclei of the vestibular system with the spinal cord. This allows posture, movement, and balance to be modulated on the
basis of equilibrium information provided by the vestibular system.
