Because patient HM had only lost his medial temporal lobe—and lost very little of his previous memories,
and did not lose the ability to form new short-term memories—it was concluded that the function of the hippocampus, and
adjacent structures in the medial temporal lobe, is to move (or consolidate) short-term memories (in the pre-frontal lobe) to
long-term memory (in the temporal lobe).

 The prefrontal cortex can also be tested for the ability to organize information. In one subtest of the mental status exam
called set generation, the patient is asked to generate a list of words that all start with the same letter, but not to include
proper nouns or names. The expectation is that a person can generate such a list of at least 10 words within 1 minute. Many
people can likely do this much more quickly, but the standard separates the accepted normal from those with compromised
prefrontal cortices.
