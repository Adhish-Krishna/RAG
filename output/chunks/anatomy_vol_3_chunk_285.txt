Your bodies do not produce enzymes that can break down most fibrous polysaccharides, such
as cellulose. While indigestible polysaccharides do not provide any nutritional value, they do provide dietary fiber, which
helps propel food through the alimentary canal.

 The chemical digestion of starches begins in the mouth and has been reviewed above.

 In the small intestine, pancreatic amylase does the ‘heavy lifting’ for starch and carbohydrate digestion (Figure
23.29). After amylases break down starch into smaller fragments, the brush border enzyme a-dextrinase starts working on
a-dextrin, breaking off one glucose unit at a time. Three brush border enzymes hydrolyze sucrose, lactose, and maltose
into monosaccharides. Sucrase splits sucrose into one molecule of fructose and one molecule of glucose; maltase breaks
down maltose and maltotriose into two and three glucose molecules, respectively; and lactase breaks down lactose into one
molecule of glucose and one molecule of galactose.
