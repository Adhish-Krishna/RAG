Endocrine surgeons treat endocrine disease
through the removal, or resection, of the affected endocrine gland.

 Patients who are referred to endocrinologists may have signs and symptoms or blood test results that suggest
excessive or impaired functioning of an endocrine gland or endocrine cells. The endocrinologist may order additional
blood tests to determine whether the patientâ€™s hormonal levels are abnormal, or they may stimulate or suppress the
function of the suspect endocrine gland and then have blood taken for analysis. Treatment varies according to the
diagnosis. Some endocrine disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, may respond to lifestyle changes such as modest weight
loss, adoption of a healthy diet, and regular physical activity. Other disorders may require medication, such as hormone
replacement, and routine monitoring by the endocrinologist. These include disorders of the pituitary gland that can
affect growth and disorders of the thyroid gland that can result in a variety of metabolic problems.
