As already stated, a newborn benefits from the IgA antibodies it obtains from milk during
breastfeeding. The fetus and newborn thus benefit from the immunological memory of the mother to the pathogens to which
she has been exposed. In medicine, artificially acquired passive immunity usually involves injections of immunoglobulins,
taken from animals previously exposed to a specific pathogen. This treatment is a fast-acting method of temporarily
protecting an individual who was possibly exposed to a pathogen. The downside to both types of passive immunity is the
lack of the development of immunological memory. Once the antibodies are transferred, they are effective for only a limited
time before they degrade.

Immunity can be acquired in an active or passive way, and it can be natural or artificial.
