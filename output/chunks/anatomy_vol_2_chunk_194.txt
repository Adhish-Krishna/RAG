The cerebral cortex is divided into four lobes. Extensive folding increases
the surface area available for cerebral functions.

 Different regions of the cerebral cortex can be associated with particular functions, a concept known as localization
of function. In the early 1900s, a German neuroscientist named Korbinian Brodmann performed an extensive study of the
microscopic anatomy—the cytoarchitecture—of the cerebral cortex and divided the cortex into 52 separate regions on the
basis of the histology of the cortex. His work resulted in a system of classification known as Brodmann’s areas, which is
still used today to describe the anatomical distinctions within the cortex (Figure 13.8). The results from Brodmann’s work
on the anatomy align very well with the functional differences within the cortex. Areas 17 and 18 in the occipital lobe are
responsible for primary visual perception. That visual information is complex, so it is processed in the temporal and parieta
lobes as well.
