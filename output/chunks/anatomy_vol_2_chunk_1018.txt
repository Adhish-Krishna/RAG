Figure 19.19 illustrates the initiation of the impulse in the SA node that then spreads the impulse

throughout the atria to the atrioventricular node.

Figure 19.19 Cardiac Conduction (1) The sinoatrial (SA) node and the remainder of the conduction system are at
rest. (2) The SA node initiates the action potential, which sweeps across the atria. (3) After reaching the atrioventricular
node, there is a delay of approximately 100 ms that allows the atria to complete pumping blood before the impulse
is transmitted to the atrioventricular bundle. (4) Following the delay, the impulse travels through the atrioventricular
bundle and bundle branches to the Purkinje fibers, and also reaches the right papillary muscle via the moderator band.
 (5) The impulse spreads to the contractile fibers of the ventricle. (6) Ventricular contraction begins.

The electrical event, the wave of depolarization, is the trigger for muscular contraction.
