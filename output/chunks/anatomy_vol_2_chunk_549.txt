As a student of anatomy and physiology, you may be planning to go into an allied health field, perhaps nursing or
physical therapy. You could be in the emergency department treating a patient such as the one just described. An important
part of this course is to understand the nervous system. This can be especially challenging because you need to learn about
the nervous system using your own nervous system. The first chapter in this unit about the nervous system began with a
quote: “If the human brain were simple enough for us to understand, we would be too simple to understand it.” However,
you are being asked to understand aspects of it. A healthcare provider can pinpoint problems with the nervous system in
minutes by running through the series of tasks to test neurological function that are described in this chapter. You can use
the same approach, though not as quickly, to learn about neurological function and its relationship to the structures of the
nervous system.
