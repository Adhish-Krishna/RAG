Lack of mechanical stress causes bones to lose mineral salts and collagen fibers, and thus strength. Similarly,
mechanical stress stimulates the deposition of mineral salts and collagen fibers. The internal and external structure of a bone
will change as stress increases or decreases so that the bone is an ideal size and weight for the amount of activity it endures.
 That is why people who exercise regularly have thicker bones than people who are more sedentary. It is also why a broken
bone in a cast atrophies while its contralateral mate maintains its concentration of mineral salts and collagen fibers. The
bones undergo remodeling as a result of forces (or lack of forces) placed on them.

 Numerous, controlled studies have demonstrated that people who exercise regularly have greater bone density than
those who are more sedentary. Any type of exercise will stimulate the deposition of more bone tissue, but resistance training
has a greater effect than cardiovascular activities.
