Subsequent investigations found
that these areas corresponded very well to functional differences in the cerebral cortex. (credit: modification of work by

Area 17, as Brodmann described it, is also known as the primary visual cortex. Adjacent to that are areas 18 and 19,
which constitute subsequent regions of visual processing. Area 22 is the primary auditory cortex, and it is followed by
area 23, which further processes auditory information. Area 4 is the primary motor cortex in the precentral gyrus, whereas
area 6 is the premotor cortex. These areas suggest some specialization within the cortex for functional processing, both in
sensory and motor regions. The fact that Brodmann’s areas correlate so closely to functional localization in the cerebral
cortex demonstrates the strong link between structure and function in these regions.

 Areas 1, 2, 3, 4, 17, and 22 are each described as primary cortical areas.
