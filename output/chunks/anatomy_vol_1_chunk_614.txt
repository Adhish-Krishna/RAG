The medullary cavity has a delicate membranous lining called the endosteum. The outer surface of bone, except in
regions covered with articular cartilage, is covered with a fibrous membrane called the periosteum. Flat bones consist of two
layers of compact bone surrounding a layer of spongy bone. Bone markings depend on the function and location of bones.
 Articulations are places where two bones meet. Projections stick out from the surface of the bone and provide attachment
points for tendons and ligaments. Holes are openings or depressions in the bones.

 Bone matrix consists of collagen fibers and organic ground substance, primarily hydroxyapatite formed from calcium
salts. Osteogenic cells develop into osteoblasts. Osteoblasts are cells that make new bone. They become osteocytes, the cells
of mature bone, when they get trapped in the matrix. Osteoclasts engage in bone resorption. Compact bone is dense and
composed of osteons, while spongy bone is less dense and made up of trabeculae.
