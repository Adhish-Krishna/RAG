Because segregation and fertilization are random, each offspring has a 25 percent chance of receiving
any of these combinations. Therefore, if an Aa x Aa cross were performed 1000 times, approximately 250 (25 percent) of the
offspring would be AA; 500 (50 percent) would be Aa (that is, Aa plus aA); and 250 (25 percent) would be aa. The genotypic
ratio for this inheritance pattern is 1:2:1. However, we have already established that AA and Aa (and aA) individuals all
express the dominant trait (i.e., share the same phenotype), and can therefore be combined into one group. The result is
Mendelâ€™s third-generation phenotype ratio of 3:1.
