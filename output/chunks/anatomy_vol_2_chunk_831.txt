Serum, one of the specimen types included, refers to a sample of plasma after
clotting factors have been removed. What types of measurements are given for levels of oxygen in the blood?

Plasma Proteins

About 7 percent of the volume of plasma—nearly all that is not water—is made of proteins. These include several plasma
proteins (proteins that are unique to the plasma), plus a much smaller number of regulatory proteins, including enzymes and

some hormones. The major components of plasma are summarized in
The three major groups of plasma proteins are as follows:

 ¢ Albumin is the most abundant of the plasma proteins. Manufactured by the liver, albumin molecules serve as binding
proteins—transport vehicles for fatty acids and steroid hormones. Recall that lipids are hydrophobic; however, their
binding to albumin enables their transport in the watery plasma. Albumin is also the most significant contributor to
the osmotic pressure of blood; that is, its presence holds water inside the blood vessels and draws water from the
tissues, across blood vessel walls, and into the bloodstream.
