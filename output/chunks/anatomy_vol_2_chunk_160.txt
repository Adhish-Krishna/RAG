Does spatial summation have to happen all at
once, or can the separate signals arrive on the postsynaptic
neuron at slightly different times? Explain your answer.

8. Watch this video  (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/
neurotrans) to learn about the release of a neurotransmitter.
 The action potential reaches the end of the axon, called
the axon terminal, and a chemical signal is released to tell
the target cell to do something, either initiate a new action
potential, or to suppress that activity. In a very short space,
the electrical signal of the action potential is changed into
the chemical signal of a neurotransmitter, and then back to
electrical changes in the target cell membrane. What is the
importance of voltage-gated calcium channels in the release
of neurotransmitters?

Cc. enteric
d. central
