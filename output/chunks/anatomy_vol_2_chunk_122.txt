Graded potentials can be of two sorts, either they are depolarizing or hyperpolarizing (Figure 12.25). For a membrane
at the resting potential, a graded potential represents a change in that voltage either above -70 mV or below -70 mV.
Depolarizing graded potentials are often the result of Na‘ or Ca** entering the cell. Both of these ions have higher
concentrations outside the cell than inside; because they have a positive charge, they will move into the cell causing it to
become less negative relative to the outside. Hyperpolarizing graded potentials can be caused by K™ leaving the cell or Cl

entering the cell. If a positive charge moves out of a cell, the cell becomes more negative; if a negative charge enters the
cell, the same thing happens.
