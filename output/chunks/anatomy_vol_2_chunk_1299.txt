Arteries transport blood away from the heart and branch into smaller vessels, forming

arterioles. Arterioles distribute blood to capillary beds, the sites of exchange with the body tissues. Capillaries lead back to
small vessels known as venules that flow into the larger veins and eventually back to the heart.

 The arterial system is a relatively high-pressure system, so arteries have thick walls that appear round in cross section.
 The venous system is a lower-pressure system, containing veins that have larger lumens and thinner walls. They often
appear flattened. Arteries, arterioles, venules, and veins are composed of three tunics known as the tunica intima, tunica
media, and tunica externa. Capillaries have only a tunica intima layer. The tunica intima is a thin layer composed of a simple
squamous epithelium known as endothelium and a small amount of connective tissue.
