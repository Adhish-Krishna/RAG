In the limbs,
mesenchyme accumulations within the growing limb bud will become a hyaline cartilage model for each of the limb bones.
 A joint interzone will develop between these areas of cartilage. Mesenchyme cells at the margins of the interzone will
give rise to the articular capsule, while cell death at the center forms the space that will become the joint cavity of the
future synovial joint. The hyaline cartilage model of each limb bone will eventually be converted into bone via the process
of endochondral ossification. However, hyaline cartilage will remain, covering the ends of the adult bone as the articular

cartilage.
