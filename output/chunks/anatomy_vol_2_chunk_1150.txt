In contrast, a high or wide
pulse pressure is common in healthy people following strenuous exercise, when their resting pulse pressure of 30-40 mm
Hg may increase temporarily to 100 mm Hg as stroke volume increases. A persistently high pulse pressure at or above 100
 mm Hg may indicate excessive resistance in the arteries and can be caused by a variety of disorders. Chronic high resting
pulse pressures can degrade the heart, brain, and kidneys, and warrant medical treatment.

Mean Arterial Pressure

Mean arterial pressure (MAP) represents the “average” pressure of blood in the arteries, that is, the average force driving
blood into vessels that serve the tissues.
