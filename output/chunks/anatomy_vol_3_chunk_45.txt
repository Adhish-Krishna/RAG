It is at this point that the capillary wall meets
the alveolar wall, creating the respiratory membrane. Once the blood is oxygenated, it drains from the alveoli by way of
multiple pulmonary veins, which exit the lungs through the hilum.

 Nervous Innervation

Dilation and constriction of the airway are achieved through nervous control by the parasympathetic and sympathetic
nervous systems. The parasympathetic system causes bronchoconstriction, whereas the sympathetic nervous system
stimulates bronchodilation. Reflexes such as coughing, and the ability of the lungs to regulate oxygen and carbon dioxide
levels, also result from this autonomic nervous system control. Sensory nerve fibers arise from the vagus nerve, and from
the second to fifth thoracic ganglia. The pulmonary plexus is a region on the lung root formed by the entrance of the nerves
at the hilum. The nerves then follow the bronchi in the lungs and branch to innervate muscle fibers, glands, and blood
vessels.
