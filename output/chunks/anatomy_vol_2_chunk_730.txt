Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is activated by growth hormone and
indirectly supports the formation of new proteins in muscle cells and bone.

 A glucose-sparing effect occurs when GH stimulates lipolysis, or the breakdown of adipose tissue, releasing fatty acids
into the blood. As a result, many tissues switch from glucose to fatty acids as their main energy source, which means that
less glucose is taken up from the bloodstream.

 GH also initiates the diabetogenic effect in which GH stimulates the liver to break down glycogen to glucose, which
is then deposited into the blood. The name “diabetogenic” is derived from the similarity in elevated blood glucose levels
observed between individuals with untreated diabetes mellitus and individuals experiencing GH excess. Blood glucose
levels rise as the result of a combination of glucose-sparing and diabetogenic effects.

 GH indirectly mediates growth and protein synthesis by triggering the liver and other tissues to produce a group of
proteins called insulin-like growth factors (IGFs).
