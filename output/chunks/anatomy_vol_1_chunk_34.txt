At some point, everyone will have a problem with
some aspect of his or her body and your knowledge can help you to be a better parent, spouse, partner, friend, colleague, or

 This chapter begins with an overview of anatomy and physiology and a preview of the body regions and functions. It
then covers the characteristics of life and how the body works to maintain stable conditions. It introduces a set of standard

information covered later in the text. It ends with examples of medical imaging used to see inside the living body.
