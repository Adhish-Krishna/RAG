The ethmoid bone and lacrimal bone make up much of the medial wall and the
sphenoid bone forms the posterior orbit.

 At the posterior apex of the orbit is the opening of the optic canal, which allows for passage of the optic nerve from
the retina to the brain. Lateral to this is the elongated and irregularly shaped superior orbital fissure, which provides passage
for the artery that supplies the eyeball, sensory nerves, and the nerves that supply the muscles involved in eye movements.
