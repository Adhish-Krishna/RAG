The granules
of eosinophils stain best with an acidic stain known as eosin. The nucleus of the eosinophil will typically have two to three
lobes and, if stained properly, the granules will have a distinct red to orange color.

 The granules of eosinophils include antihistamine molecules, which counteract the activities of histamines,
inflammatory chemicals produced by basophils and mast cells. Some eosinophil granules contain molecules toxic to
parasitic worms, which can enter the body through the integument, or when an individual consumes raw or undercooked
â€˜ish or meat. Eosinophils are also capable of phagocytosis and are particularly effective when antibodies bind to the target
and form an antigen-antibody complex. High counts of eosinophils are typical of patients experiencing allergies, parasitic
worm infestations, and some autoimmune diseases. Low counts may be due to drug toxicity and stress.

 Basophils are the least common leukocytes, typically comprising less than one percent of the total leukocyte count.
