Bursae contain a lubricating fluid that serves to reduce friction between structures. Subcutaneous bursae prevent
riction between the skin and an underlying bone, submuscular bursae protect muscles from rubbing against a bone or
another muscle, and a subtendinous bursa prevents friction between bone and a muscle tendon. Tendon sheaths contain a
ubricating fluid and surround tendons to allow for smooth movement of the tendon as it crosses a joint.

 Based on the shape of the articulating bone surfaces and the types of movement allowed, synovial joints are classified
into six types. At a pivot joint, one bone is held within a ring by a ligament and its articulation with a second bone. Pivot
joints only allow for rotation around a single axis. These are found at the articulation between the C1 (atlas) and the dens of
the C2 (axis) vertebrae, which provides the side-to-side rotation of the head, or at the proximal radioulnar joint between the
head of the radius and the radial notch of the ulna, which allows for rotation of the radius during forearm movements.
