Figure 4.14 Reticular Tissue This is a loose connective tissue made up of a network of reticular fibers that provides
a supportive framework for soft organs. LM x 1600. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan

Dense Connective Tissue

Dense connective tissue contains more collagen fibers than does loose connective tissue. As a consequence, it displays
greater resistance to stretching. There are two major categories of dense connective tissue: regular and irregular. Dense
regular connective tissue fibers are parallel to each other, enhancing tensile strength and resistance to stretching in the
direction of the fiber orientations. Ligaments and tendons are made of dense regular connective tissue, but in ligaments not
all fibers are parallel. Dense regular elastic tissue contains elastin fibers in addition to collagen fibers, which allows the
ligament to return to its original length after stretching. The ligaments in the vocal folds and between the vertebrae in the
vertebral column are elastic.
