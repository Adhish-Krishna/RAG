Figure 2.2 Elements of the Human Body The main elements that compose the human body are shown from most
abundant to least abundant.

 In nature, elements rarely occur alone. Instead, they combine to form compounds. A compound is a substance
composed of two or more elements joined by chemical bonds. For example, the compound glucose is an important body
fuel. It is always composed of the same three elements: carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Moreover, the elements that make
up any given compound always occur in the same relative amounts. In glucose, there are always six carbon and six oxygen
units for every twelve hydrogen units. But what, exactly, are these “units” of elements?

Atoms and Subatomic Particles

An atom is the smallest quantity of an element that retains the unique properties of that element.
