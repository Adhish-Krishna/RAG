Diencephalon

The diencephalon is beneath the cerebrum and includes the thalamus and hypothalamus. In the somatic nervous system,
the thalamus is an important relay for communication between the cerebrum and the rest of the nervous system. The
hypothalamus has both somatic and autonomic functions. In addition, the hypothalamus communicates with the limbic
system, which controls emotions and memory functions.

 Sensory input to the thalamus comes from most of the special senses and ascending somatosensory tracts. Each sensory
system is relayed through a particular nucleus in the thalamus. The thalamus is a required transfer point for most sensory
tracts that reach the cerebral cortex, where conscious sensory perception begins. The one exception to this rule is the
olfactory system. The olfactory tract axons from the olfactory bulb project directly to the cerebral cortex, along with the
limbic system and hypothalamus.
