Over a long period, this increases the risk of serious complications such as heart attacks,
strokes, and aneurysms. It can also contribute to system-wide edema (swelling).

 Mechanisms for regulating Na* concentration include the renin—angiotensin—aldosterone system and ADH (see Figure
25.14). Aldosterone stimulates the uptake of Na” on the apical cell membrane of cells in the DCT and collecting ducts,

whereas ADH helps to regulate Na* concentration indirectly by regulating the reabsorption of water.

 Regulation of Extracellular K*

Potassium is present in a 30-fold greater concentration inside the cell than outside the cell. A generalization can be made
that K* and Na” concentrations will move in opposite directions. When more Na” is reabsorbed, more K” is secreted; when
less Na* is reabsorbed (leading to excretion by the kidney), more K” is retained.
