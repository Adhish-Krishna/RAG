Nervous System

Early formation of the nervous system depends on the formation of the neural tube. A groove forms along the dorsal
surface of the embryo, which becomes deeper until its edges meet and close off to form the tube. If this fails to happen,
especially in the posterior region where the spinal cord forms, a developmental defect called spina bifida occurs. The
closing of the neural tube is important for more than just the proper formation of the nervous system. The surrounding
tissues are dependent on the correct development of the tube. The connective tissues surrounding the CNS can be
involved as well.

 There are three classes of this disorder: occulta, meningocele, and myelomeningocele (Figure 13.5). The first
type, spina bifida occulta, is the mildest because the vertebral bones do not fully surround the spinal cord, but the
spinal cord itself is not affected.
