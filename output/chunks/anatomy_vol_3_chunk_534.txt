Natriuretic Hormones

atriuretic hormones are peptides that stimulate the kidneys to excrete sodium—an effect opposite that of aldosterone.
 atriuretic hormones act by inhibiting aldosterone release and therefore inhibiting Na’ recovery in the collecting ducts. If

a’ remains in the forming urine, its osmotic force will cause a concurrent loss of water. Natriuretic hormones also inhibit

ADH release, which of course will result in less water recovery. Therefore, natriuretic peptides inhibit both Na” and water
recovery. One example from this family of hormones is atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH), a 28-amino acid peptide produced
by heart atria in response to over-stretching of the atrial wall. The over-stretching occurs in persons with elevated blood
pressure or heart failure. It increases GFR through concurrent vasodilation of the afferent arteriole and vasoconstriction of
the efferent arteriole. These events lead to an increased loss of water and sodium in the forming urine. It also decreases
sodium reabsorption in the DCT. There is also B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 32 amino acids produced in the ventricles
of the heart.
