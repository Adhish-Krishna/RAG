The hypothalamus also receives input from other areas
of the forebrain through the medial forebrain bundle. The olfactory cortex, the septal nuclei of the basal forebrain, and
the amygdala project into the hypothalamus through the medial forebrain bundle. These forebrain structures inform the
hypothalamus about the state of the nervous system and can influence the regulatory processes of homeostasis. A good
example of this is found in the amygdala, which is found beneath the cerebral cortex of the temporal lobe and plays a role
in our ability to remember and feel emotions.

 The Amygdala

The amygdala is a group of nuclei in the medial region of the temporal lobe that is part of the limbic lobe (Figure 15.12).
 The limbic lobe includes structures that are involved in emotional responses, as well as structures that contribute to memory
function. The limbic lobe has strong connections with the hypothalamus and influences the state of its activity on the basis of
emotional state.
