Each hip bone, in turn, is firmly joined to the axial skeleton via its attachment to
the sacrum of the vertebral column. The right and left hip bones also converge anteriorly to attach to each other. The bony
pelvis is the entire structure formed by the two hip bones, the sacrum, and, attached inferiorly to the sacrum, the coccyx
(Figure 8.12).

 Unlike the bones of the pectoral girdle, which are highly mobile to enhance the range of upper limb movements, the
bones of the pelvis are strongly united to each other to form a largely immobile, weight-bearing structure. This is important
for stability because it enables the weight of the body to be easily transferred laterally from the vertebral column, through the
pelvic girdle and hip joints, and into either lower limb whenever the other limb is not bearing weight.
