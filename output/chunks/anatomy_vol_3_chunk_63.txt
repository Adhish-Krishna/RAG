Respiratory Volumes and Capacities

Respiratory volume is the term used for various volumes of air moved by or associated with the lungs at a given point in
the respiratory cycle. There are four major types of respiratory volumes: tidal, residual, inspiratory reserve, and expiratory
reserve (Figure 22.18). Tidal volume (TV) is the amount of air that normally enters the lungs during quiet breathing, which
is about 500 milliliters. Expiratory reserve volume (ERV) is the amount of air you can forcefully exhale past a normal tidal
expiration, up to 1200 milliliters for men. Inspiratory reserve volume (IRV) is produced by a deep inhalation, past a tidal
inspiration. This is the extra volume that can be brought into the lungs during a forced inspiration. Residual volume (RV)
is the air left in the lungs if you exhale as much air as possible. The residual volume makes breathing easier by preventing
the alveoli from collapsing. Respiratory volume is dependent on a variety of factors, and measuring the different types of
respiratory volumes can provide important clues about a personâ€™s respiratory health (Figure 22.19).
