The cardiac cycle
is complete.

 Figure 19.28 illustrates the relationship between the cardiac cycle and the ECG.

Figure 19.28 Relationship between the Cardiac Cycle and ECG Initially, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed
(diastole). The P wave represents depolarization of the atria and is followed by atrial contraction (systole). Atrial systole
extends until the QRS complex, at which point, the atria relax. The QRS complex represents depolarization of the
ventricles and is followed by ventricular contraction. The T wave represents the repolarization of the ventricles and
marks the beginning of ventricular relaxation.

 Heart Sounds

One of the simplest, yet effective, diagnostic techniques applied to assess the state of a patientâ€™s heart is auscultation using
a stethoscope.

 In a normal, healthy heart, there are only two audible heart sounds: S; and S2.
