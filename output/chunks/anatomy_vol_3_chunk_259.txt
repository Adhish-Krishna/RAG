The dendritic cells with antigens then travel to neighboring lymphoid follicles in the mucosa where T cells inspect for
antigens. This process triggers an IgA-mediated response, if warranted, in the lumen that blocks the commensal organisms
from infiltrating the mucosa and setting off a far greater, widespread systematic reaction.

 Digestive Functions of the Large Intestine

The residue of chyme that enters the large intestine contains few nutrients except water, which is reabsorbed as the residue
lingers in the large intestine, typically for 12 to 24 hours. Thus, it may not surprise you that the large intestine can be
completely removed without significantly affecting digestive functioning. For example, in severe cases of inflammatory
bowel disease, the large intestine can be removed by a procedure known as a colectomy. Often, a new fecal pouch can be
crafted from the small intestine and sutured to the anus, but if not, an ileostomy can be created by bringing the distal ileum
through the abdominal wall, allowing the watery chyme to be collected in a bag-like adhesive appliance.
