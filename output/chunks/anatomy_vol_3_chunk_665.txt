Externally, the scrotum has a raised medial thickening on the surface called
the raphae.

Figure 27.3 The Scrotum and Testes This anterior view shows the structures of the scrotum and testes.

 Testes

The testes (singular = testis) are the male gonadsâ€”that is, the male reproductive organs. They produce both sperm and
androgens, such as testosterone, and are active throughout the reproductive lifespan of the male.

Paired ovals, the testes are each approximately 4 to 5 cm in length and are housed within the scrotum (see Figure
27.3). They are surrounded by two distinct layers of protective connective tissue (Figure 27.4). The outer tunica vaginalis
is a serous membrane that has both a parietal and a thin visceral layer. Beneath the tunica vaginalis is the tunica albuginea, a
tough, white, dense connective tissue layer covering the testis itself.
