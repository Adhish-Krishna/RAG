Before moving on, you need to review the gases that can diffuse across a cell membrane. Because cells rapidly use up
oxygen during metabolism, there is typically a lower concentration of O2 inside the cell than outside. As a result, oxygen
will diffuse from the interstitial fluid directly through the lipid bilayer of the membrane and into the cytoplasm within
the cell. On the other hand, because cells produce CO2 as a byproduct of metabolism, CO2 concentrations rise within
the cytoplasm; therefore, CO2 will move from the cell through the lipid bilayer and into the interstitial fluid, where its
concentration is lower. This mechanism of molecules spreading from where they are more concentrated to where they are
less concentration is a form of passive transport called simple diffusion (Figure 3.5).
