This is called size exclusion. Some ion channels are selective for charge but not

necessarily for size, and thus are called a nonspecific channel. These nonspecific channels allow cations—particularly Na”,

K’, and Ca**—1o cross the membrane, but exclude anions.

 Ion channels do not always freely allow ions to diffuse across the membrane. They are opened by certain events,
meaning the channels are gated. So another way that channels can be categorized is on the basis of how they are gated.
 Although these classes of ion channels are found primarily in cells of nervous or muscular tissue, they also can be found in

cells of epithelial and connective tissues.

 A ligand-gated channel opens because a signaling molecule, a ligand, binds to the extracellular region of the channel.
 This type of channel is also known as an ionotropic receptor because when the ligand, known as a neurotransmitter in the

nervous system, binds to the protein, ions cross the membrane changing its charge (Figure 12.18).
