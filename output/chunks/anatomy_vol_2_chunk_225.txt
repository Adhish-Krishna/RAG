The direct pathway is responsible for increasing
cortical movement commands. The increased activity of the indirect pathway results in the hypokinetic disorder of
Parkinson’s disease.

 Parkinson’s disease is neurodegenerative, meaning that neurons die that cannot be replaced, so there is no cure for
the disorder. Treatments for Parkinson’s disease are aimed at increasing dopamine levels in the striatum. Currently, the
most common way of doing that is by providing the amino acid L-DOPA, which is a precursor to the neurotransmitter
dopamine and can cross the blood-brain barrier. With levels of the precursor elevated, the remaining cells of the
substantia nigra pars compacta can make more neurotransmitter and have a greater effect. Unfortunately, the patient
will become less responsive to L-DOPA treatment as time progresses, and it can cause increased dopamine levels
elsewhere in the brain, which are associated with psychosis or schizophrenia.
