However, the
study was prematurely terminated after 5.2 years because of evidence of a higher than normal risk of breast cancer in
patients taking estrogen-only HT. The potential positive effects on cardiovascular disease were also not realized in the
estrogen-only patients. The results of other hormone replacement studies over the last 50 years, including a 2012 study
that followed over 1,000 menopausal women for 10 years, have shown cardiovascular benefits from estrogen and no
increased risk for cancer. Some researchers believe that the age group tested in the 2002 trial may have been too old to
benefit from the therapy, thus skewing the results. In the meantime, intense debate and study of the benefits and risks
of replacement therapy is ongoing. Current guidelines approve HT for the reduction of hot flashes or flushes, but this
treatment is generally only considered when women first start showing signs of menopausal changes, is used in the
lowest dose possible for the shortest time possible (5 years or less), and it is suggested that women on HT have regular
pelvic and breast exams.
