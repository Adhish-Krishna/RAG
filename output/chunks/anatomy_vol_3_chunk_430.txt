or too little can result in serious medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes.

 Vitamins and minerals are essential parts of the diet. They are needed for the proper function of metabolic pathways
in the body. Vitamins are not stored in the body, so they must be obtained from the diet or synthesized from precursors
available in the diet. Minerals are also obtained from the diet, but they are also stored, primarily in skeletal tissues.
