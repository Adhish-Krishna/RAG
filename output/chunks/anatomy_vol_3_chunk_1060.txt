Sodium ions
are reabsorbed at the membrane, and hydrogen ions are expelled into the filtrate. The hydrogen ions combine with bicarbonate,
forming carbonic acid, which dissociates into CO2 gas and water. The gas diffuses into the renal cells where carbonic anhydrase
catalyzes its conversion back into a bicarbonate ion, which enters the blood. 38 Carbonic acid blood levels are controlled through
the respiratory system by the expulsion of CO2 from the lungs. The formula for the production of bicarbonate ions is reversible if
the concentration of COz2 decreases. As this happens in the lungs, carbonic acid is converted into a gas, and the concentration of
the acid decreases. The rate of respiration determines the amount of CO2 exhaled. If the rate increases, less acid is in the blood;
if the rate decreases, the blood can become more acidic. 39 Respiratory acidosis is present as evidenced by the decreased pH and

increased pCO2, with some compensation as shown by the increased total HCO3 .
