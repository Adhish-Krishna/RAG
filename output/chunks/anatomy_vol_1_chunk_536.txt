Hair is made of dead keratinized
cells, and gets its color from melanin pigments. Nails, also made of dead keratinized cells, protect the extremities of our
fingers and toes from mechanical damage. Sweat glands and sebaceous glands produce sweat and sebum, respectively. Each
of these fluids has a role to play in maintaining homeostasis. Sweat cools the body surface when it gets overheated and helps
excrete small amounts of metabolic waste. Sebum acts as a natural moisturizer and keeps the dead, flaky, outer keratin layer
healthy.

 5.3 Functions of the Integumentary System

The skin plays important roles in protection, sensing stimuli, thermoregulation, and vitamin D synthesis. It is the first layer
of defense to prevent dehydration, infection, and injury to the rest of the body. Sweat glands in the skin allow the skin
surface to cool when the body gets overheated. Thermoregulation is also accomplished by the dilation or constriction of
