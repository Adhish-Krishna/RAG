(a) What are the names of the “junction points” between sarcomeres? (b) What are the names of the
“subunits” within the myofibrils that run the length of skeletal muscle fibers? (c) What is the “double strand of pearls”
described in the video? (d) What gives a skeletal muscle fiber its striated appearance?

 The sarcomere is the functional unit of the muscle fiber. The sarcomere itself is bundled within the myofibril that runs
the entire length of the muscle fiber and attaches to the sarcolemma at its end. As myofibrils contract, the entire muscle
cell contracts. Because myofibrils are only approximately 1.2 ym in diameter, hundreds to thousands (each with thousands
of sarcomeres) can be found inside one muscle fiber. Each sarcomere is approximately 2 pm in length with a three-
dimensional cylinder-like arrangement and is bordered by structures called Z-discs (also called Z-lines, because pictures
are two-dimensional), to which the actin myofilaments are anchored (Figure 10.5).
