The cell cycle is under precise regulation by
chemical messengers both inside and outside the cell that provide “stop” and “go” signals for movement from one phase to
the next. Failures of these signals can result in cells that continue to divide uncontrollably, which can lead to cancer.

 Once a cell has completed interphase and is ready for cell division, it proceeds through four separate stages of mitosis
(prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase). Telophase is followed by the division of the cytoplasm (cytokinesis), which
generates two daughter cells. This process takes place in all normally dividing cells of the body except for the germ cells
that produce eggs and sperm.

3.6 Cellular Differentiation

One of the major areas of research in biology is that of how cells specialize to assume their unique structures and functions,
since all cells essentially originate from a single fertilized egg.
