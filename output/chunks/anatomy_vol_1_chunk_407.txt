(b) In apocrine
secretion, the apical portion of the cell is released, as well. (c) In holocrine secretion, the cell is destroyed as it releases
its product and the cell itself becomes part of the secretion.

 Apocrine secretion accumulates near the apical portion of the cell. That portion of the cell and its secretory contents
pinch off from the cell and are released. The sweat glands of the armpit are classified as apocrine glands. Both merocrine
and apocrine glands continue to produce and secrete their contents with little damage caused to the cell because the nucleus
and golgi regions remain intact after secretion.

 In contrast, the process of holocrine secretion involves the rupture and destruction of the entire gland cell. The cell
accumulates its secretory products and releases them only when it bursts. New gland cells differentiate from cells in the
surrounding tissue to replace those lost by secretion. The sebaceous glands that produce the oils on the skin and hair are
holocrine glands/cells (Figure 4.11).
