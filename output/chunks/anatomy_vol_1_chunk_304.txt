Microtubules grow out from the centrioles by adding more tubulin subunits, like
adding additional links to a chain.

 In contrast with microtubules, the microfilament is a thinner type of cytoskeletal filament (see Figure 3.18b). Actin, a
protein that forms chains, is the primary component of these microfilaments. Actin fibers, twisted chains of actin filaments,
constitute a large component of muscle tissue and, along with the protein myosin, are responsible for muscle contraction.
 Like microtubules, actin filaments are long chains of single subunits (called actin subunits). In muscle cells, these long actin
strands, called thin filaments, are “pulled” by thick filaments of the myosin protein to contract the cell.

 Actin also has an important role during cell division. When a cell is about to split in half during cell division, actin
filaments work with myosin to create a cleavage furrow that eventually splits the cell down the middle, forming two new
cells from the original cell.
