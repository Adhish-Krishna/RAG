This situation is common if you are exercising strenuously over a period of time. To
keep up the necessary energy production, you would produce excess CO2 (and lactic acid if exercising beyond your aerobic
threshold). In order to balance the increased acid production, the respiration rate goes up to remove the CO2. This helps to
keep you from developing acidosis.

 The body regulates the respiratory rate by the use of chemoreceptors, which primarily use CO? as a signal. Peripheral
blood sensors are found in the walls of the aorta and carotid arteries. These sensors signal the brain to provide immediate
adjustments to the respiratory rate if CO2 levels rise or fall. Yet other sensors are found in the brain itself. Changes in the
pH of CSF affect the respiratory center in the medulla oblongata, which can directly modulate breathing rate to bring the
PH back into the normal range.
