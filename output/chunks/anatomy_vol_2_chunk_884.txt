A few cells
may fall outside these ranges, at 14-17 jm. This finding has led to the three size range classification.

 The three major groups of lymphocytes include natural killer cells, B cells, and T cells. Natural killer (NK) cells
are capable of recognizing cells that do not express “self” proteins on their plasma membrane or that contain foreign or
abnormal markers. These “nonself” cells include cancer cells, cells infected with a virus, and other cells with atypical
surface proteins. Thus, they provide generalized, nonspecific immunity. The larger lymphocytes are typically NK cells.

 B cells and T cells, also called B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes, play prominent roles in defending the body
against specific pathogens (disease-causing microorganisms) and are involved in specific immunity. One form of B cells
(plasma cells) produces the antibodies or immunoglobulins that bind to specific foreign or abnormal components of plasma
membranes.
