As cell division continues, however, the cells begin to undergo differentiation into
distinct tissue layers, and eventually into all of the specialized cells, tissues, and organs of the fetus. The progression from
the undifferentiated cells to certain types of differentiated cells goes on throughout life, even in the bodies of adults.

 Growth is the increase in body size. Humans, like all multicellular organisms, grow by increasing the number of
existing cells, increasing the amount of non-cellular material around cells (such as mineral deposits in bone), and, within
very narrow limits, increasing the size of existing cells.

 Renewal is the formation of new cells for growth, repair, or replacement. In some organ systems, such as the digestive
system, worn-out cells are constantly replaced throughout life. Some other specialized cells, however, have only a limited
capacity for renewal. This is true, for example, of nerve cells of the nervous system.
