The tendon common to all four is the quadriceps tendon (patellar tendon), which inserts into the
patella and continues below it as the patellar ligament. The patellar ligament attaches to the tibial tuberosity. In addition to
the quadriceps femoris, the sartorius is a band-like muscle that extends from the anterior superior iliac spine to the medial
side of the proximal tibia. This versatile muscle flexes the leg at the knee and flexes, abducts, and laterally rotates the leg at
the hip. This muscle allows us to sit cross-legged.

 The posterior compartment of the thigh includes muscles that flex the leg and extend the thigh. The three long
muscles on the back of the knee are the hamstring group, which flexes the knee. These are the biceps femoris,
semitendinosus, and semimembranosus. The tendons of these muscles form the popliteal fossa, the diamond-shaped
space at the back of the knee.
