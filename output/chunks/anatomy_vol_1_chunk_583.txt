After birth, this
same sequence of events (matrix mineralization, death of chondrocytes, invasion of blood vessels from the periosteum, and
seeding with osteogenic cells that become osteoblasts) occurs in the epiphyseal regions, and each of these centers of activity
is referred to as a secondary ossification center (Figure 6.17e).

 How Bones Grow in Length

The epiphyseal plate is the area of growth in a long bone. It is a layer of hyaline cartilage where ossification occurs in
immature bones. On the epiphyseal side of the epiphyseal plate, cartilage is formed. On the diaphyseal side, cartilage is
ossified, and the diaphysis grows in length. The epiphyseal plate is composed of four zones of cells and activity (Figure
6.18). The reserve zone is the region closest to the epiphyseal end of the plate and contains small chondrocytes within the
matrix. These chondrocytes do not participate in bone growth but secure the epiphyseal plate to the osseous tissue of the

epiphysis.
