If you decide
to delay defecation, it takes a few seconds for the reflex contractions to stop and the rectal walls to relax. The next mass
movement will trigger additional defecation reflexes until you defecate.
 f defecation is delayed for an extended time, additional water is absorbed, making the feces firmer and potentially
leading to constipation. On the other hand, if the waste matter moves too quickly through the intestines, not enough water is
absorbed, and diarrhea can result. This can be caused by the ingestion of foodborne pathogens. In general, diet, health, and
stress determine the frequency of bowel movements. The number of bowel movements varies greatly between individuals,
ranging from two or three per day to three or four per week.

 By watching this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/foodgroups) you will see that for the various food
groups—proteins, fats, and carbohydrates—digestion begins in different parts of the digestion system, though all end
in the same place.
