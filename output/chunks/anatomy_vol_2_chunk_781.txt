If blood glucose concentration drops below this range,
glucagon is released, which stimulates body cells to release glucose into the blood.

 Insulin

The primary function of insulin is to facilitate the uptake of glucose into body cells. Red blood cells, as well as cells of
the brain, liver, kidneys, and the lining of the small intestine, do not have insulin receptors on their cell membranes and do
not require insulin for glucose uptake. Although all other body cells do require insulin if they are to take glucose from the
bloodstream, skeletal muscle cells and adipose cells are the primary targets of insulin.
