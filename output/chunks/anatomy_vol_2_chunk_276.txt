nigra pars compacta nuclei within the basal nuclei that release dopamine to modulate the function of
the striatum; part of the motor pathway

substantia nigra pars reticulata nuclei within the basal nuclei that serve as an output center of the nuclei; part of the
motor pathway

subthalamus nucleus within the basal nuclei that is part of the indirect pathway
sulcus groove formed by convolutions in the surface of the cerebral cortex

superior colliculus half of the midbrain tectum that is responsible for aligning visual, auditory, and somatosensory
spatial perceptions

superior sagittal sinus dural sinus that runs along the top of the longitudinal fissure and drains blood from the
majority of the outer cerebrum

sympathetic chain ganglia autonomic ganglia in a chain along the anterolateral aspect of the vertebral column that
are responsible for contributing to homeostatic mechanisms of the autonomic nervous system

systemic nerve nerve in the periphery distal to a nerve plexus or spinal nerve

tectum region of the midbrain, thought of as the roof of the cerebral aqueduct, which is subdivided into the inferior and
superior colliculi

tegmentum region of the midbrain, thought of as the floor of the cerebral aqueduct, which continues into the pons and
medulla as the floor of the fourth ventricle

telencephalon secondary vesicle of the embryonic brain that develops into the cerebrum

temporal lobe region of the cerebral cortex directly beneath the temporal bone of the cranium

CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 555

terminal ganglion autonomic ganglia that are near or within the walls of organs that are responsible for contributing to
homeostatic mechanisms of the autonomic nervous system

thalamus major region of the diencephalon that is responsible for relaying information between the cerebrum and the
hindbrain, spinal cord, and periphery

third ventricle portion of the ventricular system that is in the region of the diencephalon
tibial nerve systemic nerve of the posterior leg that begins as part of the sciatic nerve
transverse sinuses dural sinuses that drain along either side of the occipitalâ€”cerebellar space
trigeminal ganglion sensory ganglion that contributes sensory fibers to the trigeminal nerve

trigeminal nerve fifth cranial nerve; responsible for cutaneous sensation of the face and contraction of the muscles of
mastication

trochlear nerve fourth cranial nerve; responsible for contraction of one of the extraocular muscles
ulnar nerve systemic nerve of the arm located close to the ulna, a bone of the forearm

vagus nerve tenth cranial nerve; responsible for the autonomic control of organs in the thoracic and upper abdominal
cavities

ventral (anterior) nerve root axons emerging from the anterior or lateral horns of the spinal cord

ventricles remnants of the hollow center of the neural tube that are spaces for cerebrospinal fluid to circulate through
the brain

vertebral arteries arteries that ascend along either side of the vertebral column through the transverse foramina of the
cervical vertebrae and enter the cranium through the foramen magnum

vestibulocochlear nerve eighth cranial nerve; responsible for the sensations of hearing and balance

13.1 The Embryologic Perspective

The development of the nervous system starts early in embryonic development.
