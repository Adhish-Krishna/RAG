The trigger
for these diseases is, more often than not, unknown, and the treatments are usually based on resolving the symptoms using
immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory drugs such as steroids. These diseases can be localized and crippling, as in
rheumatoid arthritis, or diffuse in the body with multiple symptoms that differ in different individuals, as is the case with
systemic lupus erythematosus (Figure 21.29).
