Angiotensin II has three major
functions:

1. Initiating vasoconstriction of the arterioles, decreasing blood flow

2. Stimulating kidney tubules to reabsorb NaCl and water, increasing blood volume

3. Signaling the adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone, the effects of which further contribute to fluid retention, restoring
blood pressure and blood volume

For individuals with hypertension, or high blood pressure, drugs are available that block the production of angiotensin
Il. These drugs, known as ACE inhibitors, block the ACE enzyme from converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II, thus
mitigating the latterâ€™s ability to increase blood pressure.

Hormones of the Zona Fasciculata

The intermediate region of the adrenal cortex is the zona fasciculata, named as such because the cells form small fascicles
(bundles) separated by tiny blood vessels.
