The last feature
by which to name a muscle is its action. When muscles are named for the movement they produce, one can find action
words in their name. Some examples are flexor (decreases the angle at the joint), extensor (increases the angle at the joint),
abductor (moves the bone away from the midline), or adductor (moves the bone toward the midline).

 11.3 | Axial Muscles of the Head, Neck, and Back

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Identify the axial muscles of the face, head, and neck
¢ Identify the movement and function of the face, head, and neck muscles

 The skeletal muscles are divided into axial (muscles of the trunk and head) and appendicular (muscles of the arms and
legs) categories. This system reflects the bones of the skeleton system, which are also arranged in this manner.
