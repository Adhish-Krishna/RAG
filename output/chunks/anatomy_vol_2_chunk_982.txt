Like the right ventricle, the left also has trabeculae carneae, but there
is no moderator band. The mitral valve is connected to papillary muscles via chordae tendineae. There are two papillary
muscles on the left—the anterior and posterior—as opposed to three on the right.

 The left ventricle is the major pumping chamber for the systemic circuit; it ejects blood into the aorta through the aortic
semilunar valve.

 Heart Valve Structure and Function

A transverse section through the heart slightly above the level of the atrioventricular septum reveals all four heart valves
along the same plane (Figure 19.12). The valves ensure unidirectional blood flow through the heart. Between the right
atrium and the right ventricle is the right atrioventricular valve, or tricuspid valve. It typically consists of three flaps, or
leaflets, made of endocardium reinforced with additional connective tissue. The flaps are connected by chordae tendineae
to the papillary muscles, which control the opening and closing of the valves.
