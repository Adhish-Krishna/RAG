What goes wrong in the function of insulin in type 2 diabetes?

Insulin also reduces blood glucose levels by stimulating glycolysis, the metabolism of glucose for generation of ATP.
 Moreover, it stimulates the liver to convert excess glucose into glycogen for storage, and it inhibits enzymes involved in
glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Finally, insulin promotes triglyceride and protein synthesis. The secretion of insulin
is regulated through a negative feedback mechanism. As blood glucose levels decrease, further insulin release is inhibited.
 The pancreatic hormones are summarized in Table 17.7.

Hormones of the Pancreas

Associated hormones Chemical class Effect
Insulin (beta cells) Protein Reduces blood glucose levels
Glucagon (alpha cells) Protein Increases blood glucose levels
Somatostatin (delta cells) Protein Inhibits insulin and glucagon release
Pancreatic polypeptide (PP cells) | Protein Role in appetite

Endocrine System: Diabetes Mellitus

Dysfunction of insulin production and secretion, as well as the target cellsâ€™ responsiveness to insulin, can lead to a
condition called diabetes mellitus.
