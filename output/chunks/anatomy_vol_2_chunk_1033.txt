The major segments and intervals of an ECG tracing are indicated in Figure 19.23. Segments are defined as the regions
between two waves. Intervals include one segment plus one or more waves. For example, the PR segment begins at the end
of the P wave and ends at the beginning of the QRS complex. The PR interval starts at the beginning of the P wave and
ends with the beginning of the QRS complex. The PR interval is more clinically relevant, as it measures the duration from
the beginning of atrial depolarization (the P wave) to the initiation of the QRS complex. Since the Q wave may be difficult
to view in some tracings, the measurement is often extended to the R that is more easily visible. Should there be a delay
in passage of the impulse from the SA node to the AV node, it would be visible in the PR interval.
