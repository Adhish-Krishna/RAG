Mechanical Digestion

In the large intestine, mechanical digestion begins when chyme moves from the ileum into the cecum, an activity regulated
by the ileocecal sphincter. Right after you eat, peristalsis in the ileum forces chyme into the cecum. When the cecum is

distended with chyme, contractions of the ileocecal sphincter strengthen. Once chyme enters the cecum, colon movements
begin.

 Mechanical digestion in the large intestine includes a combination of three types of movements. The presence of
food residues in the colon stimulates a slow-moving haustral contraction. This type of movement involves sluggish
segmentation, primarily in the transverse and descending colons. When a haustrum is distended with chyme, its muscle
contracts, pushing the residue into the next haustrum. These contractions occur about every 30 minutes, and each last
about 1 minute. These movements also mix the food residue, which helps the large intestine absorb water.
