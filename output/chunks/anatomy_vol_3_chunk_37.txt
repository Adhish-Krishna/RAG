Roaming around the alveolar wall is the alveolar macrophage, a
phagocytic cell of the immune system that removes debris and pathogens that have reached the alveoli.

 The simple squamous epithelium formed by type | alveolar cells is attached to a thin, elastic basement membrane. This
epithelium is extremely thin and borders the endothelial membrane of capillaries. Taken together, the alveoli and capillary
membranes form a respiratory membrane that is approximately 0.5 mm thick. The respiratory membrane allows gases to
cross by simple diffusion, allowing oxygen to be picked up by the blood for transport and CO32 to be released into the air of
the alveoli.
