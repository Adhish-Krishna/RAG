The extracellular matrix contains fluid, proteins,
polysaccharide derivatives, and, in the case of bone, mineral crystals. Protein fibers fall into three major groups: collagen
fibers that are thick, strong, flexible, and resist stretch; reticular fibers that are thin and form a supportive mesh; and elastin
fibers that are thin and elastic.

CHAPTER 4| THE TISSUE LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION 167

The major types of connective tissue are connective tissue proper, supportive tissue, and fluid tissue. Loose connective
tissue proper includes adipose tissue, areolar tissue, and reticular tissue. These serve to hold organs and other tissues in place
and, in the case of adipose tissue, isolate and store energy reserves. The matrix is the most abundant feature for loose tissue
although adipose tissue does not have much extracellular matrix. Dense connective tissue proper is richer in fibers and may
be regular, with fibers oriented in parallel as in ligaments and tendons, or irregular, with fibers oriented in several directions.
