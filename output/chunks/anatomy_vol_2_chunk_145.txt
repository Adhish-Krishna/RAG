The anatomical divisions are
the central and peripheral nervous systems. The CNS is the brain and spinal cord. The PNS is everything else. Functionally,
the nervous system can be divided into those regions that are responsible for sensation, those that are responsible for
integration, and those that are responsible for generating responses. All of these functional areas are found in both the central
and peripheral anatomy.

 Considering the anatomical regions of the nervous system, there are specific names for the structures within each
division. A localized collection of neuron cell bodies is referred to as a nucleus in the CNS and as a ganglion in the PNS. A
bundle of axons is referred to as a tract in the CNS and as a nerve in the PNS. Whereas nuclei and ganglia are specifically
in the central or peripheral divisions, axons can cross the boundary between the two. A single axon can be part of a nerve
and a tract. The name for that specific structure depends on its location.
