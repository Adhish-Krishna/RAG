A single contraction is called a twitch. A muscle
twitch has a latent period, a contraction phase, and a relaxation phase. A graded muscle response allows variation in muscle
tension. Summation occurs as successive stimuli are added together to produce a stronger muscle contraction. Tetanus is the
â€˜usion of contractions to produce a continuous contraction. Increasing the number of motor neurons involved increases the
amount of motor units activated in a muscle, which is called recruitment. Muscle tone is the constant low-level contractions
that allow for posture and stability.

10.5 Types of Muscle Fibers

ATP provides the energy for muscle contraction. The three mechanisms for ATP regeneration are creatine phosphate,
anaerobic glycolysis, and aerobic metabolism. Creatine phosphate provides about the first 15 seconds of ATP at the
beginning of muscle contraction. Anaerobic glycolysis produces small amounts of ATP in the absence of oxygen for a short
period. Aerobic metabolism utilizes oxygen to produce much more ATP, allowing a muscle to work for longer periods.
