As a pregnancy progresses into its final weeks, several
physiological changes occur in response to hormones that trigger labor.

 First, recall that progesterone inhibits uterine contractions throughout the first several months of pregnancy. As the
pregnancy enters its seventh month, progesterone levels plateau and then drop. Estrogen levels, however, continue to rise
in the maternal circulation (Figure 28.20). The increasing ratio of estrogen to progesterone makes the myometrium (the
uterine smooth muscle) more sensitive to stimuli that promote contractions (because progesterone no longer inhibits them).
 Moreover, in the eighth month of pregnancy, fetal cortisol rises, which boosts estrogen secretion by the placenta and
further overpowers the uterine-calming effects of progesterone. Some women may feel the result of the decreasing levels of
progesterone in late pregnancy as weak and irregular peristaltic Braxton Hicks contractions, also called false labor. These
contractions can often be relieved with rest or hydration.
