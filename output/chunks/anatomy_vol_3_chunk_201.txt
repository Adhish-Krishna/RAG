Anatomy of a Tooth

The teeth are secured in the alveolar processes (sockets) of the maxilla and the mandible. Gingivae (commonly called the
gums) are soft tissues that line the alveolar processes and surround the necks of the teeth. Teeth are also held in their sockets
by a connective tissue called the periodontal ligament.

 The two main parts of a tooth are the crown, which is the portion projecting above the gum line, and the root, which
is embedded within the maxilla and mandible. Both parts contain an inner pulp cavity, containing loose connective tissue
through which run nerves and blood vessels. The region of the pulp cavity that runs through the root of the tooth is called
the root canal. Surrounding the pulp cavity is dentin, a bone-like tissue. In the root of each tooth, the dentin is covered
by an even harder bone-like layer called cementum.
