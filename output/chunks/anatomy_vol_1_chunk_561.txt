Flat bones, like those of the cranium, consist of a layer of diploé (spongy bone), lined on either side by a layer of
compact bone (Figure 6.9). The two layers of compact bone and the interior spongy bone work together to protect the
internal organs. If the outer layer of a cranial bone fractures, the brain is still protected by the intact inner layer.

side by a layer of compact bone.

 Bone Markings

The surface features of bones vary considerably, depending on the function and location in the body. Table 6.2 describes the
bone markings, which are illustrated in (Figure 6.10). There are three general classes of bone markings: (1) articulations,
(2) projections, and (3) holes.
