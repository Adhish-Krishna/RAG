Food mixed with hydrochloric acid from the stomach would burn the small intestine,
the next portion of the digestive tract after the stomach, if it were not for the release of bicarbonate (HCO3 ), a weak base
that attracts H*. Bicarbonate accepts some of the H* protons, thereby reducing the acidity of the solution.

 The Concept of pH

The relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution can be indicated by its pH. A solutionâ€™s pH is the negative, base-10 logarithm

of the hydrogen ion (H") concentration of the solution. As an example, a pH 4 solution has an H* concentration that is ten
times greater than that of a pH 5 solution. That is, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times more acidic than a solution with a
PH of 5. The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH scale, like that shown in Figure 2.17.
