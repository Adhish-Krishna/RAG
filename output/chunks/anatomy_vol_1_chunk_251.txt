CHAPTER 3 | THE CELLULAR LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION 87

Figure 3.1 Flourescence-stained Cell Undergoing Mitosis A lung cell from a newt, commonly studied for its
similarity to human lung cells, is stained with fluorescent dyes. The green stain reveals mitotic spindles, red is the
cell membrane and part of the cytoplasm, and the structures that appear light blue are chromosomes. This cell is in
anaphase of mitosis. (credit: “Mortadelo2005”/Wikimedia Commons)
