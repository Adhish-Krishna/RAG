Ventilation is the movement of air into
and out of the lungs, and perfusion is the flow of blood in the pulmonary capillaries. For gas exchange to be efficient, the
volumes involved in ventilation and perfusion should be compatible. However, factors such as regional gravity effects on
blood, blocked alveolar ducts, or disease can cause ventilation and perfusion to be imbalanced.

 The partial pressure of oxygen in alveolar air is about 104 mm Hg, whereas the partial pressure of the oxygenated
pulmonary venous blood is about 100 mm Hg. When ventilation is sufficient, oxygen enters the alveoli at a high rate, and
the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli remains high. In contrast, when ventilation is insufficient, the partial pressure
of oxygen in the alveoli drops. Without the large difference in partial pressure between the alveoli and the blood, oxygen
does not diffuse efficiently across the respiratory membrane. The body has mechanisms that counteract this problem. In
cases when ventilation is not sufficient for an alveolus, the body redirects blood flow to alveoli that are receiving sufficient
ventilation.
