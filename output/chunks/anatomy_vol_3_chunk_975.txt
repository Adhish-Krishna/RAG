classification of joints is based on the degree of mobility exhibited by the joint. A synarthrosis is an immobile or nearly immobile
joint. An example is the manubriosternal joint or the joints between the skull bones surrounding the brain. An amphiarthrosis is
a slightly moveable joint, such as the pubic symphysis or an intervertebral cartilaginous joint. A diarthrosis is a freely moveable
joint. These are subdivided into three categories. A uniaxial diarthrosis allows movement within a single anatomical plane or axis
of motion. The elbow joint is an example. A biaxial diarthrosis, such as the metacarpophalangeal joint, allows for movement
along two planes or axes. The hip and shoulder joints are examples of a multiaxial diarthrosis. These allow movements along
three planes or axes. 54 The functional needs of joints vary and thus joints differ in their degree of mobility.
