Figure 27.14 Ovaries, Uterine Tubes, and Uterus This anterior view shows the relationship of the ovaries, uterine
tubes (oviducts), and uterus. Sperm enter through the vagina, and fertilization of an ovulated oocyte usually occurs in
the distal uterine tube. From left to right, LM x 400, LM x 20. (Micrographs provided by the Regents of University of

The open-ended structure of the uterine tubes can have significant health consequences if bacteria or other contagions
enter through the vagina and move through the uterus, into the tubes, and then into the pelvic cavity.
