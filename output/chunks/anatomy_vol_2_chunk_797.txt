The endoderm gives rise to the thyroid and parathyroid glands, as well as the pancreas and the
thymus.

 As the body ages, changes occur that affect the endocrine system, sometimes altering the production, secretion, and
catabolism of hormones. For example, the structure of the anterior pituitary gland changes as vascularization decreases and
the connective tissue content increases with increasing age. This restructuring affects the gland’s hormone production. For
example, the amount of human growth hormone that is produced declines with age, resulting in the reduced muscle mass
commonly observed in the elderly.

 The adrenal glands also undergo changes as the body ages; as fibrous tissue increases, the production of cortiso!
and aldosterone decreases. Interestingly, the production and secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine remain norma!
throughout the aging process.

 A well-known example of the aging process affecting an endocrine gland is menopause and the decline of ovarian
‘unction.
