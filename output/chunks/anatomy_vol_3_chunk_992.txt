36 The disease would target oligodendrocytes. In the CNS,
oligodendrocytes provide the myelin for axons. 37 Bipolar cells, because they have one dendrite that receives input and one axon
that provides output, would be a direct relay between two other cells. 38 Afferent means “toward,” as in sensory information
traveling from the periphery into the CNS. Efferent means “away from,” as in motor commands that travel from the brain down
the spinal cord and out into the periphery. 39 The upper motor neuron would be affected because it is carrying the command from

the brain down. 40 The cell membrane must reach threshold before voltage-gated Na‘ channels open. If threshold is not reached,

those channels do not open, and the depolarizing phase of the action potential does not occur, the cell membrane will just go back
to its resting state.
