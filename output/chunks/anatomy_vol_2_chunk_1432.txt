IgE is bound to mast cells
via its Fe portion. When an
allergen binds to these
antibodies, crosslinking of
IgE induces degranulation.

 Cells are destroyed by bound
antibody, either by activation of
complement or by a cytotoxic
T cell with an Fe receptor for
the antibody (ADCC)

 Antigen—antibody complexes
are deposited in tissues,
causing activation of
complement, which attracts
neutrophils to the site

Th1 cells secrete cytokines,
which activate macrophages
and cytotoxic T cells and can
cause macrophage
accumulation at the site

Causes localized and
systemic anaphylaxis,
seasonal allergies including
hay fever, food allergies

such as those to shellfish and

Red blood cells destroyed by
complement and antibody
during a transfusion of
mismatched blood type or
during erythroblastosis fetalis

Most common forms of
immune complex disease are
seen in glomerulonephritis,
rheumatoid arthritis, and
systemic lupus erythematosus

Most common forms are
contact dermatitis, tuberculin
reaction, autoimmune diseases
such as diabetes mellitus

type I, multiple sclerosis, and

peanuts, hives, and eczema rheumatoid arthritis
