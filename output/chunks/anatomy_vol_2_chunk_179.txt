However, its structure does not differ from the basic layout of the neural tube. It is a long, straight cord with a small,
hollow space down the center. The neural tube is defined in terms of its anterior versus posterior portions, but it also has a
dorsalâ€”ventral dimension. As the neural tube separates from the rest of the ectoderm, the side closest to the surface is dorsal,
and the deeper side is ventral.

 As the spinal cord develops, the cells making up the wall of the neural tube proliferate and differentiate into the neurons
and glia of the spinal cord. The dorsal tissues will be associated with sensory functions, and the ventral tissues will be
associated with motor functions.

 Relating Embryonic Development to the Adult Brain

Embryonic development can help in understanding the structure of the adult brain because it establishes a framework
on which more complex structures can be built.
