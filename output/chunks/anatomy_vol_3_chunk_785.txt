The sperm sample is also concentrated, to increase the sperm
count per milliliter.

 Next, the eggs and sperm are mixed in a petri dish. The ideal ratio is 75,000 sperm to one egg. If there are
severe problems with the sperm—for example, the count is exceedingly low, or the sperm are completely nonmotile,
or incapable of binding to or penetrating the zona pellucida—a sperm can be injected into an egg. This is called
intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).

 The embryos are then incubated until they either reach the eight-cell stage or the blastocyst stage. In the United
States, fertilized eggs are typically cultured to the blastocyst stage because this results in a higher pregnancy rate.
 Finally, the embryos are transferred to a woman’s uterus using a plastic catheter (tube). Figure 28.3 illustrates the steps
involved in IVF.
