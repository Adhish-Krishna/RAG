Figure 9.5 Fibrous Joints Fibrous joints form strong connections between bones. (a) Sutures join most bones of the
skull. (b) An interosseous membrane forms a syndesmosis between the radius and ulna bones of the forearm. (c) A
gomphosis is a specialized fibrous joint that anchors a tooth to its socket in the jaw.

 Suture

All the bones of the skull, except for the mandible, are joined to each other by a fibrous joint called a suture. The fibrous
connective tissue found at a suture (“to bind or sew”) strongly unites the adjacent skull bones and thus helps to protect the
brain and form the face. In adults, the skull bones are closely opposed and fibrous connective tissue fills the narrow gap
between the bones. The suture is frequently convoluted, forming a tight union that prevents most movement between the
bones. (See Figure 9.5a.) Thus, skull sutures are functionally classified as a synarthrosis, although some sutures may allow
for slight movements between the cranial bones.
