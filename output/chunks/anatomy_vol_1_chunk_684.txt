Paranasal Sinuses

The paranasal sinuses are hollow, air-filled spaces located within certain bones of the skull (Figure 7.18). All of the sinuses
communicate with the nasal cavity (paranasal = “next to nasal cavity”) and are lined with nasal mucosa. They serve to
reduce bone mass and thus lighten the skull, and they also add resonance to the voice. This second feature is most obvious
when you have a cold or sinus congestion. These produce swelling of the mucosa and excess mucus production, which
can obstruct the narrow passageways between the sinuses and the nasal cavity, causing your voice to sound different to
yourself and others. This blockage can also allow the sinuses to fill with fluid, with the resulting pressure producing pain
and discomfort.

 The paranasal sinuses are named for the skull bone that each occupies. The frontal sinus is located just above the
eyebrows, within the frontal bone (see Figure 7.17).
