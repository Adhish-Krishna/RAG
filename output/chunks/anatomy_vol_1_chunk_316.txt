The two new daughter DNA molecules each contain one pre-
existing strand and one newly synthesized strand. Thus, DNA replication is said to be “semiconservative.”

108 CHAPTER 3 | THE CELLULAR LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION

Stage 1: Initiation. The two complementary strands are separated, much like unzipping a zipper. Special enzymes,
including helicase, untwist and separate the two strands of DNA.

 Stage 2: Elongation. Each strand becomes a template along which a new complementary strand is built. DNA
polymerase brings in the correct bases to complement the template strand, synthesizing a new strand base by base. A DNA
polymerase is an enzyme that adds free nucleotides to the end of a chain of DNA, making a new double strand. This growing
strand continues to be built until it has fully complemented the template strand.

 Stage 3: Termination. Once the two original strands are bound to their own, finished, complementary strands, DNA
replication is stopped and the two new identical DNA molecules are complete.
