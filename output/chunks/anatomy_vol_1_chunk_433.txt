The striation is due to the regular alternation of the
contractile proteins actin and myosin, along with the structural proteins that couple the contractile proteins to connective
tissues. The cells are multinucleated as a result of the fusion of the many myoblasts that fuse to form each long muscle fiber.

154 CHAPTER 4 | THE TISSUE LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION

Cardiac muscle forms the contractile walls of the heart. The cells of cardiac muscle, known as cardiomyocytes, also
appear striated under the microscope. Unlike skeletal muscle fibers, cardiomyocytes are single cells typically with a single
centrally located nucleus. A principal characteristic of cardiomyocytes is that they contract on their own intrinsic rhythms
without any external stimulation. Cardiomyocyte attach to one another with specialized cell junctions called intercalated
discs. Intercalated discs have both anchoring junctions and gap junctions. Attached cells form long, branching cardiac
muscle fibers that are, essentially, a mechanical and electrochemical syncytium allowing the cells to synchronize their
actions.
