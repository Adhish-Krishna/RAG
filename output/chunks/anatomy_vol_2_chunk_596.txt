Finally, one nerve controls the
muscles of the neck, assisting with spinal control of the movement of the head and neck.

CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 659

The cranial nerve exam allows directed tests of forebrain and brain stem structures. The twelve cranial nerves serve the
head and neck. The vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) has autonomic functions in the thoracic and superior abdominal cavities.
 The special senses are served through the cranial nerves, as well as the general senses of the head and neck. The movement
of the eyes, face, tongue, throat, and neck are all under the control of cranial nerves. Preganglionic parasympathetic nerve
fibers that control pupillary size, salivary glands, and the thoracic and upper abdominal viscera are found in four of the
nerves. Tests of these functions can provide insight into damage to specific regions of the brain stem and may uncover
deficits in adjacent regions.
