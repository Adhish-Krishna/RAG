CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 563

Structural Receptor Types

The cells that interpret information about the environment can be either (1) a neuron that has a free nerve ending, with
dendrites embedded in tissue that would receive a sensation; (2) a neuron that has an encapsulated ending in which the
sensory nerve endings are encapsulated in connective tissue that enhances their sensitivity; or (3) a specialized receptor cell,
which has distinct structural components that interpret a specific type of stimulus (Figure 14.2).
