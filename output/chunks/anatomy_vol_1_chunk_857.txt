8.4 Bones of the Lower Limb

[he lower limb is divided into three regions. These are the thigh, located between the hip and knee joints; the leg, located
between the knee and ankle joints; and distal to the ankle, the foot. There are 30 bones in each lower limb. These are the
emur, patella, tibia, fibula, seven tarsal bones, five metatarsal bones, and 14 phalanges.
 The femur is the single bone of the thigh. Its rounded head articulates with the acetabulum of the hip bone to form the
hip joint. The head has the fovea capitis for attachment of the ligament of the head of the femur. The narrow neck joins
inferiorly with the greater and lesser trochanters. Passing between these bony expansions are the intertrochanteric line on the
anterior femur and the larger intertrochanteric crest on the posterior femur. On the posterior shaft of the femur is the gluteal
tuberosity proximally and the linea aspera in the mid-shaft region.
