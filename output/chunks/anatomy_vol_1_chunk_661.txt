The most common is a linear skull fracture, in which fracture lines radiate
from the point of impact. Other fracture types include a comminuted fracture, in which the bone is broken into several
pieces at the point of impact, or a depressed fracture, in which the fractured bone is pushed inward. In a contrecoup
(counterblow) fracture, the bone at the point of impact is not broken, but instead a fracture occurs on the opposite side
of the skull. Fractures of the occipital bone at the base of the skull can occur in this manner, producing a basilar fracture
that can damage the artery that passes through the carotid canal.

 A blow to the lateral side of the head may fracture the bones of the pterion. The pterion is an important clinical
landmark because located immediately deep to it on the inside of the skull is a major branch of an artery that supplies
the skull and covering layers of the brain.
