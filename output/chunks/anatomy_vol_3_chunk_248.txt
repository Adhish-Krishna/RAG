In addition to gas, symptoms include abdominal cramps, bloating, and
diarrhea. Symptom severity ranges from mild discomfort to severe pain; however, symptoms resolve once the lactose
is eliminated in feces.

 The hydrogen breath test is used to help diagnose lactose intolerance. Lactose-tolerant people have very little
hydrogen in their breath. Those with lactose intolerance exhale hydrogen, which is one of the gases produced by
the bacterial fermentation of lactose in the colon. After the hydrogen is absorbed from the intestine, it is transported
through blood vessels into the lungs. There are a number of lactose-free dairy products available in grocery stores. In
addition, dietary supplements are available. Taken with food, they provide lactase to help digest lactose.

 The Large Intestine

he large intestine is the terminal part of the alimentary canal. The primary function of this organ is to finish absorption of
nutrients and water, synthesize certain vitamins, form feces, and eliminate feces from the body.
