Most of the
resulting ammonia is converted into urea by liver hepatocytes. Urea is not only less toxic but is utilized to aid in the
recovery of water by the loop of Henle and collecting ducts. At the same time that water is freely diffusing out of the
descending loop through aquaporin channels into the interstitial spaces of the medulla, urea freely diffuses into the lumen
of the descending loop as it descends deeper into the medulla, much of it to be reabsorbed from the forming urine when it

reaches the collecting duct. Thus, the movement of Na” and urea into the interstitial spaces by these mechanisms creates the
hyperosmotic environment of the medulla. The net result of this countercurrent multiplier system is to recover both water

and Na’ in the circulation.
 The amino acid glutamine can be deaminated by the kidney. As NH2 from the amino acid is converted into NH3 and

pumped into the lumen of the PCT, Na’ and HCO3, are excreted into the interstitial fluid of the renal pyramid via a symport
mechanism.
