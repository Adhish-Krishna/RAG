The vagus nerve connects to taste
buds in the extreme posterior of the tongue, verging on the pharynx, which are more sensitive to noxious stimuli such as
bitterness.

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/DanielleReed) to learn about Dr. Danielle Reed of the Monell
Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who became interested in science at an early age because of her
sensory experiences. She recognized that her sense of taste was unique compared with other people she knew. Now,
she studies the genetic differences between people and their sensitivities to taste stimuli. In the video, there is a brief
image of a person sticking out their tongue, which has been covered with a colored dye. This is how Dr. Reed is able
to visualize and count papillae on the surface of the tongue. People fall into two groups known as “tasters” and “non-
tasters” based on the density of papillae on their tongue, which also indicates the number of taste buds.
