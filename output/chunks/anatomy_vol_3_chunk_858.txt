An obstetrician, midwife, or nurse can estimate how well a newborn is doing by obtaining an Apgar score. The
Apgar score was introduced in 1952 by the anesthesiologist Dr. Virginia Apgar as a method to assess the effects on the
newborn of anesthesia given to the laboring mother. Healthcare providers now use it to assess the general wellbeing of
the newborn, whether or not analgesics or anesthetics were used.

 Five criteria—skin color, heart rate, reflex, muscle tone, and respiration—are assessed, and each criterion is
assigned a score of 0, 1, or 2. Scores are taken at 1 minute after birth and again at 5 minutes after birth. Each time that
scores are taken, the five scores are added together. High scores (out of a possible 10) indicate the baby has made the
transition from the womb well, whereas lower scores indicate that the baby may be in distress.
