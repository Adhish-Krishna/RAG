Fenestrations

Figure 25.12 Fenestrated Capillary Fenestrations allow many substances to diffuse from the blood based primarily
on size.

 The fenestrations prevent filtration of blood cells or large proteins, but allow most other constituents through. These
substances cross readily if they are less than 4 nm in size and most pass freely up to 8 nm in size. An additional factor
affecting the ability of substances to cross this barrier is their electric charge. The proteins associated with these pores are
negatively charged, so they tend to repel negatively charged substances and allow positively charged substances to pass
more readily. The basement membrane prevents filtration of medium-to-large proteins such as globulins. There are also
mesangial cells in the filtration membrane that can contract to help regulate the rate of filtration of the glomerulus. Overall,
filtration is regulated by fenestrations in capillary endothelial cells, podocytes with filtration slits, membrane charge, and
the basement membrane between capillary cells.
