Changes in an organismâ€™s internal environment, such as increased body temperature, can cause the responses of
sweating and the dilation of blood vessels in the skin in order to decrease body temperature, as shown by the runners in
Figure 1.7.

Movement

Human movement includes not only actions at the joints of the body, but also the motion of individual organs and even
individual cells. As you read these words, red and white blood cells are moving throughout your body, muscle cells are
contracting and relaxing to maintain your posture and to focus your vision, and glands are secreting chemicals to regulate
body functions. Your body is coordinating the action of entire muscle groups to enable you to move air into and out of your
lungs, to push blood throughout your body, and to propel the food you have eaten through your digestive tract.
