Blood from most of the smaller vessels
originating from the inferior cerebral veins flows into the great cerebral vein and into the straight sinus. Other cerebral
veins and those from the eye socket flow into the cavernous sinus, which flows into the petrosal sinus and then into
the internal jugular vein. The occipital sinus, sagittal sinus, and straight sinuses all flow into the left and right transverse
sinuses near the lambdoid suture. The transverse sinuses in turn flow into the sigmoid sinuses that pass through the jugular
foramen and into the internal jugular vein. The internal jugular vein flows parallel to the common carotid artery and is
more or less its counterpart. It empties into the brachiocephalic vein. The veins draining the cervical vertebrae and the
posterior surface of the skull, including some blood from the occipital sinus, flow into the vertebral veins. These parallel
the vertebral arteries and travel through the transverse foramina of the cervical vertebrae. The vertebral veins also flow into
the brachiocephalic veins.
