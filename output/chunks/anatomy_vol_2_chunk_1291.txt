Blood cells and vessel production in structures outside the embryo proper called the yolk sac, chorion, and connecting stalk
begin about 15 to 16 days following fertilization. Development of these circulatory elements within the embryo itself begins
approximately 2 days later. You will learn more about the formation and function of these early structures when you study
the chapter on development. During those first few weeks, blood vessels begin to form from the embryonic mesoderm. The
precursor cells are known as hemangioblasts. These in turn differentiate into angioblasts, which give rise to the blood
vessels and pluripotent stem cells, which differentiate into the formed elements of blood. (Seek additional content for more
detail on fetal development and circulation.) Together, these cells form masses known as blood islands scattered throughout
the embryonic disc. Spaces appear on the blood islands that develop into vessel lumens. The endothelial lining of the
vessels arise from the angioblasts within these islands. Surrounding mesenchymal cells give rise to the smooth muscle and
connective tissue layers of the vessels.
