Maintaining these normal concentrations of testosterone promotes spermatogenesis, whereas low levels of testosterone can
lead to infertility. In addition to intratesticular secretion, testosterone is also released into the systemic circulation and plays
an important role in muscle development, bone growth, the development of secondary sex characteristics, and maintaining

libido (sex drive) in both males and females. In females, the ovaries secrete small amounts of testosterone, although most is
converted to estradiol. A small amount of testosterone is also secreted by the adrenal glands in both sexes.

 Control of Testosterone

The regulation of testosterone concentrations throughout the body is critical for male reproductive function. The intricate
interplay between the endocrine system and the reproductive system is shown in Figure 27.8.

 Hypothalamus releases GnRH.
 GnRH stimulates the anterior pituitary
to release FSH and LH.

 Inhibin negatively
feeds back to anterior
pituitary, inhibiting
further release of FSH.
