Figure 18.4 Hematopoietic System of Bone Marrow Hemopoiesis is the proliferation and differentiation of the
formed elements of blood.

 Lymphoid and myeloid stem cells do not immediately divide and differentiate into mature formed elements. As
you can see in Figure 18.4, there are several intermediate stages of precursor cells (literally, forerunner cells), many of
which can be recognized by their names, which have the suffix -blast. For instance, megakaryoblasts are the precursors
of megakaryocytes, and proerythroblasts become reticulocytes, which eject their nucleus and most other organelles before
maturing into erythrocytes.

 Hemopoietic Growth Factors

Development from stem cells to precursor cells to mature cells is again initiated by hemopoietic growth factors. These
include the following:
¢ Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone secreted by the interstitial fibroblast cells of the kidneys in response
to low oxygen levels.
