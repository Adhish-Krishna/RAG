Development of the Embryo

In the vast majority of ectopic pregnancies, the embryo does not complete its journey to the uterus and implants in the
uterine tube, referred to as a tubal pregnancy. However, there are also ovarian ectopic pregnancies (in which the egg
never left the ovary) and abdominal ectopic pregnancies (in which an egg was “lost” to the abdominal cavity during
the transfer from ovary to uterine tube, or in which an embryo from a tubal pregnancy re-implanted in the abdomen).
