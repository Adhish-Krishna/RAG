The
anterior hamate has a prominent bony hook. The proximal and distal carpal rows articulate with each other at the midcarpal
joint. The carpal bones, together with the flexor retinaculum, also form the carpal tunnel of the wrist.

 The five metacarpal bones form the palm of the hand. The metacarpal bones are numbered 1-5, starting with the thumb
side. The first metacarpal bone is freely mobile, but the other bones are united as a group. The digits are also numbered
â€”5, with the thumb being number 1. The fingers and thumb contain a total of 14 phalanges (phalanx bones). The thumb
contains a proximal and a distal phalanx, whereas the remaining digits each contain proximal, middle, and distal phalanges.

The pelvic girdle, consisting of a hip bone, serves to attach a lower limb to the axial skeleton.
