Language is processed in the left side of the brain and directly influences the
left brain and right arm motor functions, but is sent to influence the right brain and left arm motor functions through
the corpus callosum. Likewise, the left-handed sensory perception of what is in the left pocket travels across the corpus
callosum from the right brain, so no verbal report on those contents would be possible if the hand happened to be in
the pocket.
