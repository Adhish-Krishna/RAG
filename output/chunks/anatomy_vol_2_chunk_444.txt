Predict the response of a target effector to autonomic input on the basis of the released signaling molecule

* Describe how the central nervous system coordinates and contributes to autonomic functions

The autonomic nervous system is often associated with the “fight-or-flight response,” which refers to the preparation of the
body to either run away from a threat or to stand and fight in the face of that threat. To suggest what this means, consider the
(very unlikely) situation of seeing a lioness hunting out on the savannah. Though this is not a common threat that humans
deal with in the modern world, it represents the type of environment in which the human species thrived and adapted. The
spread of humans around the world to the present state of the modern age occurred much more quickly than any species
would adapt to environmental pressures such as predators.
