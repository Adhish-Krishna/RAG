A thrombus (plural = thrombi) is an aggregation of platelets, erythrocytes, and even WBCs typically trapped
within a mass of fibrin strands. While the formation of a clot is normal following the hemostatic mechanism just described,
thrombi can form within an intact or only slightly damaged blood vessel. In a large vessel, a thrombus will adhere to the
vessel wall and decrease the flow of blood, and is referred to as a mural thrombus. In a small vessel, it may actually totally
block the flow of blood and is termed an occlusive thrombus. Thrombi are most commonly caused by vessel damage to
the endothelial lining, which activates the clotting mechanism. These may include venous stasis, when blood in the veins,
particularly in the legs, remains stationary for long periods. This is one of the dangers of long airplane flights in crowded
conditions and may lead to deep vein thrombosis or atherosclerosis, an accumulation of debris in arteries.
