The anterior nasal septum is formed by the septal cartilage,
a flexible plate that fills in the gap between the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid and vomer bones. This cartilage also
extends outward into the nose where it separates the right and left nostrils. The septal cartilage is not found in the dry skull.

 Attached to the lateral wall on each side of the nasal cavity are the superior, middle, and inferior nasal conchae
(singular = concha), which are named for their positions (see Figure 7.13). These are bony plates that curve downward as
they project into the space of the nasal cavity. They serve to swirl the incoming air, which helps to warm and moisturize it
before the air moves into the delicate air sacs of the lungs. This also allows mucus, secreted by the tissue lining the nasal
cavity, to trap incoming dust, pollen, bacteria, and viruses.
