In fact, the chemical formula for a “generic” molecule of carbohydrate is (CH20)n.

Carbohydrates are referred to as saccharides, a word meaning “sugars.” Three forms are important in the body.
 Monosaccharides are the monomers of carbohydrates. Disaccharides (di- = “two”) are made up of two monomers.
 Polysaccharides are the polymers, and can consist of hundreds to thousands of monomers.

 Monosaccharides

A monosaccharide is a monomer of carbohydrates. Five monosaccharides are important in the body. Three of these are the
hexose sugars, so called because they each contain six atoms of carbon. These are glucose, fructose, and galactose, shown
in Figure 2.18a. The remaining monosaccharides are the two pentose sugars, each of which contains five atoms of carbon.
 They are ribose and deoxyribose, shown in Figure 2.18b.
