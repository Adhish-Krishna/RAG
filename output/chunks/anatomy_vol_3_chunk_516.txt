When this process occurs in the cells of the PCT, the added benefit is a net loss of a hydrogen ion (complexed

to ammonia to form the weak acid NH4*) in the urine and a gain of a bicarbonate ion (HCO3 ) in the blood. Ammonia
and bicarbonate are exchanged in a one-to-one ratio. This exchange is yet another means by which the body can buffer and
excrete acid. The presence of aquaporin channels in the descending loop allows prodigious quantities of water to leave the
loop and enter the hyperosmolar interstitium of the pyramid, where it is returned to the circulation by the vasa recta. As
the loop turns to become the ascending loop, there is an absence of aquaporin channels, so water cannot leave the loop.

 However, in the basal membrane of cells of the thick ascending loop, ATPase pumps actively remove Naâ€™ from the cell.
