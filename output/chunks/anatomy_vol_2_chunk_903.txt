The events in the intrinsic pathway are completed in a few minutes.

 Common Pathway

Both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways lead to the common pathway, in which fibrin is produced to seal off the vessel.
 Once factor X has been activated by either the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway, the enzyme prothrombinase converts factor II,
the inactive enzyme prothrombin, into the active enzyme thrombin. (Note that if the enzyme thrombin were not normally
in an inactive form, clots would form spontaneously, a condition not consistent with life.) Then, thrombin converts factor I,
the insoluble fibrinogen, into the soluble fibrin protein strands. Factor XIII then stabilizes the fibrin clot.

 Fibrinolysis

The stabilized clot is acted upon by contractile proteins within the platelets. As these proteins contract, they pull on the
fibrin threads, bringing the edges of the clot more tightly together, somewhat as we do when tightening loose shoelaces
(see Figure 18.14a).
