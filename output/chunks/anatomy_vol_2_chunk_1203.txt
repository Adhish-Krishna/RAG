In
addition, EPO is a vasoconstrictor. Overproduction of EPO or excessive intake of synthetic EPO, often to enhance athletic
performance, will increase viscosity, resistance, and pressure, and decrease flow in addition to its contribution as a
vasoconstrictor.

 Atrial Natriuretic Hormone

Secreted by cells in the atria of the heart, atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH) (also known as atrial natriuretic peptide) is
secreted when blood volume is high enough to cause extreme stretching of the cardiac cells. Cells in the ventricle produce
