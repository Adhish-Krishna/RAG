Make sure not to confuse
the concept of a pair of chromatids (one chromosome and its exact copy attached during mitosis) and a homologous pair of
chromosomes (two paired chromosomes which were inherited separately, one from each parent) (Figure 3.31).

Sister chromatids

Figure 3.31 A Homologous Pair of Chromosomes with their Attached Sister Chromatids The red and blue
colors correspond to a homologous pair of chromosomes. Each member of the pair was separately inherited from one
parent. Each chromosome in the homologous pair is also bound to an identical sister chromatid, which is produced by
DNA replication, and results in the familiar “X” shape.

 Mitosis and Cytokinesis

The mitotic phase of the cell typically takes between 1 and 2 hours. During this phase, a cell undergoes two major
processes. First, it completes mitosis, during which the contents of the nucleus are equitably pulled apart and distributed
between its two halves.
