CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 593

14.3 | Motor Responses

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ List the components of the basic processing stream for the motor system
* Describe the pathway of descending motor commands from the cortex to the skeletal muscles
* Compare different descending pathways, both by structure and function
¢ Explain the initiation of movement from the neurological connections

¢ Describe several reflex arcs and their functional roles

The defining characteristic of the somatic nervous system is that it controls skeletal muscles. Somatic senses inform the
nervous system about the external environment, but the response to that is through voluntary muscle movement. The term
“voluntary” suggests that there is a conscious decision to make a movement.
