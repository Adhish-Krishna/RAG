This means that the sensory deficits will be based on the particular sensory information each pathway conveys. Sensory
discrimination between touch and painful stimuli will illustrate the difference in how these pathways divide these
functions.

 On the paralyzed leg, a patient will acknowledge painful stimuli, but not fine touch or proprioceptive sensations.
 On the functional leg, the opposite is true. The reason for this is that the dorsal column pathway ascends ipsilateral
to the sensation, so it would be damaged the same way as the lateral corticospinal tract. The spinothalamic pathway
decussates immediately upon entering the spinal cord and ascends contralateral to the source; it would therefore bypass
the hemisection.

 The motor system can indicate the loss of input to the ventral horn in the lumbar enlargement where motor neurons
to the leg are found, but motor function in the trunk is less clear.
