And as
noted earlier, the let-down of milk occurs in response to stimulation from oxytocin.

 In a non-pregnant woman, prolactin secretion is inhibited by prolactin-inhibiting hormone (PIH), which is actually the
neurotransmitter dopamine, and is released from neurons in the hypothalamus. Only during pregnancy do prolactin levels
rise in response to prolactin-releasing hormone (PRH) from the hypothalamus.

 Intermediate Pituitary: Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone

The cells in the zone between the pituitary lobes secrete a hormone known as melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH)
that is formed by cleavage of the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) precursor protein. Local production of MSH in the skin
is responsible for melanin production in response to UV light exposure. The role of MSH made by the pituitary is more
complicated. For instance, people with lighter skin generally have the same amount of MSH as people with darker skin.
