In both
conditions the cells do not function properly.

 Lymphoma is a form of cancer in which masses of malignant T and/or B lymphocytes collect in lymph nodes, the
spleen, the liver, and other tissues. As in leukemia, the malignant leukocytes do not function properly, and the patient is
vulnerable to infection. Some forms of lymphoma tend to progress slowly and respond well to treatment. Others tend to
progress quickly and require aggressive treatment, without which they are rapidly fatal.

 Platelets

You may occasionally see platelets referred to as thrombocytes, but because this name suggests they are a type of cell,
it is not accurate. A platelet is not a cell but rather a fragment of the cytoplasm of a cell called a megakaryocyte that is
surrounded by a plasma membrane. Megakaryocytes are descended from myeloid stem cells (see Figure 18.4) and are large,
typically 50-100 ym in diameter, and contain an enlarged, lobed nucleus.
