Germ Cells

The least mature cells, the spermatogonia (singular = spermatogonium), line the basement membrane inside the tubule.
 Spermatogonia are the stem cells of the testis, which means that they are still able to differentiate into a variety of different
cell types throughout adulthood. Spermatogonia divide to produce primary and secondary spermatocytes, then spermatids,
which finally produce formed sperm. The process that begins with spermatogonia and concludes with the production of
sperm is called spermatogenesis.

 Spermatogenesis

As just noted, spermatogenesis occurs in the seminiferous tubules that form the bulk of each testis (see Figure 27.4). The
process begins at puberty, after which time sperm are produced constantly throughout a manâ€™s life. One production cycle,
from spermatogonia through formed sperm, takes approximately 64 days. A new cycle starts approximately every 16 days,

although this timing is not synchronous across the seminiferous tubules.
