The patient needs to understand the instructions, transform them into movements, and use sensory feedback, both visua
and proprioceptive, to perform the movements correctly.
 The second subtest for sensory perception is gnosis, which involves two tasks. The first task, known as stereognosis,
nvolves the naming of objects strictly on the basis of the somatosensory information that comes from manipulating them.
 [he patient keeps their eyes closed and is given a common object, such as a coin, that they have to identify. The patient
should be able to indicate the particular type of coin, such as a dime versus a penny, or a nickel versus a quarter, on the basis
of the sensory cues involved. For example, the size, thickness, or weight of the coin may be an indication, or to differentiate
the pairs of coins suggested here, the smooth or corrugated edge of the coin will correspond to the particular denomination.
