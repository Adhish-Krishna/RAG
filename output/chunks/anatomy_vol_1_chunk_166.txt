Such reactions are referred to as decomposition reactions. A decomposition reaction is a
chemical reaction that breaks down or “de-composes” something larger into its constituent parts (see Figure 2.12b). The
general equation for a decomposition reaction is: AB > A+B.

An exchange reaction is a chemical reaction in which both synthesis and decomposition occur, chemical bonds are
both formed and broken, and chemical energy is absorbed, stored, and released (see Figure 2.12c). The simplest form of an
exchange reaction might be: A+ BC > AB +C. Notice that, to produce these products, B and C had to break apart in a
