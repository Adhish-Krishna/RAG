Functional Receptor Types

A third classification of receptors is by how the receptor transduces stimuli into membrane potential changes. Stimuli are
of three general types. Some stimuli are ions and macromolecules that affect transmembrane receptor proteins when these
chemicals diffuse across the cell membrane. Some stimuli are physical variations in the environment that affect receptor
cell membrane potentials. Other stimuli include the electromagnetic radiation from visible light. For humans, the only
electromagnetic energy that is perceived by our eyes is visible light. Some other organisms have receptors that humans lack,
such as the heat sensors of snakes, the ultraviolet light sensors of bees, or magnetic receptors in migratory birds.

 Receptor cells can be further categorized on the basis of the type of stimuli they transduce. Chemical stimuli can
be interpreted by a chemoreceptor that interprets chemical stimuli, such as an objectâ€™s taste or smell. Osmoreceptors
respond to solute concentrations of body fluids. Additionally, pain is primarily a chemical sense that interprets the presence
of chemicals from tissue damage, or similar intense stimuli, through a nociceptor.
