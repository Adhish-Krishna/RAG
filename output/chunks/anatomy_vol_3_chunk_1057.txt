47 PTH affects absorption
and reabsorption of calcium. 48 When first discovered, it was named for its known activityâ€”vasoconstriction. 49 In cases 0!
diabetes mellitus, there is more glucose present than the kidney can recover and the excess glucose is lost in the urine. It possesses
osmotic character so that it attracts water to the forming urine. 50 Protein has osmotic properties. If there is not enough protein in

1 The interstitial fluid (IF). 2 Fluid enters the capillaries from interstitial spaces. 3 Drinking seawater dehydrates the body as the
body must pass sodium through the kidneys, and water follows. 4 Because oxygen is reduced, the respiratory rate increases to
accommodate, and hyperventilation removes CO? faster than normal, resulting in alkalosis.
