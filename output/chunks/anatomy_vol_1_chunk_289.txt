Endoplasmic reticulum can exist in two forms: rough ER and smooth ER. These two types of ER perform some very
different functions and can be found in very different amounts depending on the type of cell. Rough ER (RER) is so-
called because its membrane is dotted with embedded granules—organelles called ribosomes, giving the RER a bumpy
appearance. A ribosome is an organelle that serves as the site of protein synthesis. It is composed of two ribosomal RNA
subunits that wrap around mRNA to start the process of translation, followed by protein synthesis. Smooth ER (SER) lacks
these ribosomes.

 One of the main functions of the smooth ER is in the synthesis of lipids. The smooth ER synthesizes phospholipids, the
main component of biological membranes, as well as steroid hormones. For this reason, cells that produce large quantities
of such hormones, such as those of the female ovaries and male testes, contain large amounts of smooth ER.
