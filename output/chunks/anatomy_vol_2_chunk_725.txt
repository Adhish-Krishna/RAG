Because little ADH is
produced and secreted, not enough water is reabsorbed by the kidneys. Although patients feel thirsty, and increase their
fluid consumption, this doesn’t effectively decrease the solute concentration in their blood because ADH levels are not high
enough to trigger water reabsorption in the kidneys. Electrolyte imbalances can occur in severe cases of diabetes insipidus.

 Anterior Pituitary

The anterior pituitary originates from the digestive tract in the embryo and migrates toward the brain during fetal
development. There are three regions: the pars distalis is the most anterior, the pars intermedia is adjacent to the posterior
pituitary, and the pars tuberalis is a slender “tube” that wraps the infundibulum.

 Recall that the posterior pituitary does not synthesize hormones, but merely stores them. In contrast, the anterior
pituitary does manufacture hormones. However, the secretion of hormones from the anterior pituitary is regulated by
two classes of hormones. These hormones—secreted by the hypothalamus—are the releasing hormones that stimulate the
secretion of hormones from the anterior pituitary and the inhibiting hormones that inhibit secretion.
