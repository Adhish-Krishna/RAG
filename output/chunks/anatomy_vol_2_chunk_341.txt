These nerve endings detect the movement of hair at the surface of the skin, such as when an
insect may be walking along the skin. Stretching of the skin is transduced by stretch receptors known as bulbous corpuscles.
 Bulbous corpuscles are also known as Ruffini corpuscles, or type II cutaneous mechanoreceptors.

 Other somatosensory receptors are found in the joints and muscles. Stretch receptors monitor the stretching of tendons,
muscles, and the components of joints. For example, have you ever stretched your muscles before or after exercise and
noticed that you can only stretch so far before your muscles spasm back to a less stretched state? This spasm is a reflex
that is initiated by stretch receptors to avoid muscle tearing. Such stretch receptors can also prevent over-contraction
of a muscle. In skeletal muscle tissue, these stretch receptors are called muscle spindles. Golgi tendon organs similarly
transduce the stretch levels of tendons. Bulbous corpuscles are also present in joint capsules, where they measure stretch
in the components of the skeletal system within the joint.
