Similarly, the
larger the molecule, the greater the number of total bonds, so reactions involving smaller molecules, with fewer total bonds,
would be expected to proceed faster.

 In addition, recall that some elements are more reactive than others. Reactions that involve highly reactive elements
like hydrogen proceed more quickly than reactions that involve less reactive elements. Reactions involving stable elements
like helium are not likely to happen at all.

 Temperature

Nearly all chemical reactions occur at a faster rate at higher temperatures. Recall that kinetic energy is the energy of matter
in motion. The kinetic energy of subatomic particles increases in response to increases in thermal energy. The higher the
temperature, the faster the particles move, and the more likely they are to come in contact and react.

 Concentration and Pressure

If just a few people are dancing at a club, they are unlikely to step on each otherâ€™s toes.
