At birth, the brain case and orbits of the skull are disproportionally large compared to the bones of the jaws and lower
face. This reflects the relative underdevelopment of the maxilla and mandible, which lack teeth, and the small sizes of the
paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. During early childhood, the mastoid process enlarges, the two halves of the mandible
and frontal bone fuse together to form single bones, and the paranasal sinuses enlarge. The jaws also expand as the teeth
begin to appear. These changes all contribute to the rapid growth and enlargement of the face during childhood.
