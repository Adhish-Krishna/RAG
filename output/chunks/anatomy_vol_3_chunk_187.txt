This arch is called the palate. The anterior region of the palate serves as a wall (or septum) between the oral and
nasal cavities as well as a rigid shelf against which the tongue can push food. It is created by the maxillary and palatine
bones of the skull and, given its bony structure, is known as the hard palate. If you run your tongue along the roof of your
mouth, you’ll notice that the hard palate ends in the posterior oral cavity, and the tissue becomes fleshier. This part of the
palate, known as the soft palate, is composed mainly of skeletal muscle. You can therefore manipulate, subconsciously, the
soft palate—for instance, to yawn, swallow, or sing (see Figure 23.7).
