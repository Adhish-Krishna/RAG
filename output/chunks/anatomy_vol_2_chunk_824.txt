This protects the body from further
blood loss.

 Maintenance of Homeostasis

Recall that body temperature is regulated via a classic negative-feedback loop. If you were exercising on a warm day, your
rising core body temperature would trigger several homeostatic mechanisms, including increased transport of blood from
your core to your body periphery, which is typically cooler. As blood passes through the vessels of the skin, heat would be
dissipated to the environment, and the blood returning to your body core would be cooler. In contrast, on a cold day, blood
is diverted away from the skin to maintain a warmer body core. In extreme cases, this may result in frostbite.

 Blood also helps to maintain the chemical balance of the body. Proteins and other compounds in blood act as buffers,
which thereby help to regulate the pH of body tissues. Blood also helps to regulate the water content of body cells.

 Composition of Blood

You have probably had blood drawn from a superficial vein in your arm, which was then sent to a lab for analysis.
