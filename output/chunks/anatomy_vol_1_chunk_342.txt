The other cell transforms into the functional cell of the tissue, typically replacing an “old”
cell there.

 Imagine a cell that completed mitosis but never underwent cytokinesis. In some cases, a cell may divide its genetic
material and grow in size, but fail to undergo cytokinesis. This results in larger cells with more than one nucleus. Usually
this is an unwanted aberration and can be a sign of cancerous cells.

 Cell Cycle Control

A very elaborate and precise system of regulation controls direct the way cells proceed from one phase to the next in the cell
cycle and begin mitosis. The control system involves molecules within the cell as well as external triggers. These internal
and external control triggers provide “stop” and “advance” signals for the cell. Precise regulation of the cell cycle is critical
for maintaining the health of an organism, and loss of cell cycle control can lead to cancer.
