Within the petrous region of the
temporal bone is the bony labyrinth of the inner ear. The vestibule is the portion for equilibrium, composed of the utricle,
saccule, and the three semicircular canals. The cochlea is responsible for transducing sound waves into a neural signal. The
sensory nerves from these two structures travel side-by-side as the vestibulocochlear nerve, though they are really separate
divisions. They both emerge from the inner ear, pass through the internal auditory meatus, and synapse in nuclei of the
superior medulla. Though they are part of distinct sensory systems, the vestibular nuclei and the cochlear nuclei are close
neighbors with adjacent inputs. Deficits in one or both systems could occur from damage that encompasses structures close
to both. Damage to structures near the two nuclei can result in deficits to one or both systems.

 Balance or hearing deficits may be the result of damage to the middle or inner ear structures.
