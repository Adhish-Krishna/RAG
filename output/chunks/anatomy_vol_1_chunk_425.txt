All of the preventive measures aim to increase the
strength of the tendon and decrease the stress put on it. With proper rest and managed care, you will be back on the
court to hit that slice-spin serve over the net.

 Supportive Connective Tissues

Two major forms of supportive connective tissue, cartilage and bone, allow the body to maintain its posture and protect
internal organs.

 Cartilage

The distinctive appearance of cartilage is due to polysaccharides called chondroitin sulfates, which bind with ground
substance proteins to form proteoglycans. Embedded within the cartilage matrix are chondrocytes, or cartilage cells,
and the space they occupy are called lacunae (singular = lacuna). A layer of dense irregular connective tissue, the
perichondrium, encapsulates the cartilage. Cartilaginous tissue is avascular, thus all nutrients need to diffuse through the
matrix to reach the chondrocytes.
