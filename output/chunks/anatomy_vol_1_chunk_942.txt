It has a loose articular capsule and is supported by ligaments and the rotator cuff muscles.

 The large range of motions at the shoulder joint is provided by the articulation of the large, rounded humeral head with
the small and shallow glenoid cavity, which is only about one third of the size of the humeral head. The socket formed by
the glenoid cavity is deepened slightly by a small lip of fibrocartilage called the glenoid labrum, which extends around the
outer margin of the cavity. The articular capsule that surrounds the glenohumeral joint is relatively thin and loose to allow
for large motions of the upper limb. Some structural support for the joint is provided by thickenings of the articular capsule
wall that form weak intrinsic ligaments. These include the coracohumeral ligament, running from the coracoid process of
the scapula to the anterior humerus, and three ligaments, each called a glenohumeral ligament, located on the anterior side
of the articular capsule.
