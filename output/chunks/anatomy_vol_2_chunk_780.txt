Glucagon effects:

* Inhibits body cells from taking
up glucose from the blood and
utilizing it in cellular respiration

Glucagon release:
* Alpha cells of pancreas

Figure 17.19 Homeostatic Regulation of Blood Glucose Levels Blood glucose concentration is tightly maintained
between 70 mg/dL and 110 mg/dL. If blood glucose concentration rises above this range, insulin is released, which
stimulates body cells to remove glucose from the blood.
