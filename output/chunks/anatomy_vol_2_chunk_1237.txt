It flows into the posterior cerebral arteries. Table

Figure 20.26 Arteries Supplying the Head and Neck The common carotid artery gives rise to the external and
internal carotid arteries. The external carotid artery remains superficial and gives rise to many arteries of the head.
 The internal carotid artery first forms the carotid sinus and then reaches the brain via the carotid canal and carotid
foramen, emerging into the cranium via the foramen lacerum. The vertebral artery branches from the subclavian artery
and passes through the transverse foramen in the cervical vertebrae, entering the base of the skull at the vertebral
foramen. The subclavian artery continues toward the arm as the axillary artery.
