The smooth muscle layers of the tunica media are supported by a framework of collagenous fibers that also binds the
tunica media to the inner and outer tunics. Along with the collagenous fibers are large numbers of elastic fibers that appear
as wavy lines in prepared slides. Separating the tunica media from the outer tunica externa in larger arteries is the external
elastic membrane (also called the external elastic lamina), which also appears wavy in slides. This structure is not usually
seen in smaller arteries, nor is it seen in veins.

 Tunica Externa

The outer tunic, the tunica externa (also called the tunica adventitia), is a substantial sheath of connective tissue composed
primarily of collagenous fibers. Some bands of elastic fibers are found here as well. The tunica externa in veins also contains

groups of smoot
some larger arterâ€™

h muscle fibers. This is normally the thickest tunic in veins and may be thicker than the tunica media in
ies.
