The distal end of the femur has medial and lateral bony expansions. On the lateral side, the smooth portion that covers
the distal and posterior aspects of the lateral expansion is the lateral condyle of the femur. The roughened area on the outer,
lateral side of the condyle is the lateral epicondyle of the femur. Similarly, the smooth region of the distal and posterior
medial femur is the medial condyle of the femur, and the irregular outer, medial side of this is the medial epicondyle
of the femur. The lateral and medial condyles articulate with the tibia to form the knee joint. The epicondyles provide
attachment for muscles and supporting ligaments of the knee. The adductor tubercle is a small bump located at the superior
margin of the medial epicondyle. Posteriorly, the medial and lateral condyles are separated by a deep depression called the
intercondylar fossa. Anteriorly, the smooth surfaces of the condyles join together to form a wide groove called the patellar
surface, which provides for articulation with the patella bone.
