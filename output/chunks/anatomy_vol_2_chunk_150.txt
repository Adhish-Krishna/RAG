The lower motor neuron is that cell in the gray
matter of the spinal cord and its axon extends into the periphery where it synapses with a skeletal muscle in a neuromuscular
junction.

 12.4 The Action Potential

The nervous system is characterized by electrical signals that are sent from one area to another. Whether those areas are
close or very far apart, the signal must travel along an axon. The basis of the electrical signal is the controlled distribution of

ions across the membrane. Transmembrane ion channels regulate when ions can move in or out of the cell, so that a precise
signal is generated. This signal is the action potential which has a very characteristic shape based on voltage changes across
the membrane in a given time period.

 The membrane is normally at rest with established Na‚Äù and K* concentrations on either side. A stimulus will start the
depolarization of the membrane, and voltage-gated channels will result in further depolarization followed by repolarization
of the membrane.
