Psychological stresses include the perception of a physical threat, a fight with a loved one, or just a bad day
at school.

 The body responds in different ways to short-term stress and long-term stress following a pattern known as the general
adaptation syndrome (GAS). Stage one of GAS is called the alarm reaction. This is short-term stress, the fight-or-flight
response, mediated by the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla via the SAM pathway. Their
function is to prepare the body for extreme physical exertion. Once this stress is relieved, the body quickly returns to normal.
 The section on the adrenal medulla covers this response in more detail.

 If the stress is not soon relieved, the body adapts to the stress in the second stage called the stage of resistance. If
a person is starving for example, the body may send signals to the gastrointestinal tract to maximize the absorption of
nutrients from food.
