Because it is
easier to remember the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) than to estimate the date of conception, obstetricians set
the due date as 284 days (approximately 40.5 weeks) from the LMP. This assumes that conception occurred on day 14 of
the woman’s cycle, which is usually a good approximation. The 40 weeks of an average pregnancy are usually discussed
in terms of three trimesters, each approximately 13 weeks. During the second and third trimesters, the pre-pregnancy
uterus—about the size of a fist—grows dramatically to contain the fetus, causing a number of anatomical changes in the
mother (Figure 28.18).
