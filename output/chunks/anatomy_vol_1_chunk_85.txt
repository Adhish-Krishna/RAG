These terms
are essential for describing the relative locations of different body structures. For instance, an anatomist might describe one
band of tissue as “inferior to” another or a physician might describe a tumor as “superficial to” a deeper body structure.
 Commit these terms to memory to avoid confusion when you are studying or describing the locations of particular body
parts.
