The digestive role of the liver is to produce bile and export it to the duodenum. The gallbladder
primarily stores, concentrates, and releases bile. The pancreas produces pancreatic juice, which contains digestive enzymes
and bicarbonate ions, and delivers it to the duodenum.

Figure 23.24 Accessory Organs The liver, pancreas, and gallbladder are considered accessory digestive organs,
but their roles in the digestive system are vital.

 The Liver

The liver is the largest gland in the body, weighing about three pounds in an adult. It is also one of the most important
organs. In addition to being an accessory digestive organ, it plays a number of roles in metabolism and regulation. The
liver lies inferior to the diaphragm in the right upper quadrant of the abdominal cavity and receives protection from the
surrounding ribs.
