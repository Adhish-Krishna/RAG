This second motor neuron is responsible for causing muscle fibers to contract.
 In the manner described in the chapter on muscle tissue, an action potential travels along the motor neuron axon into the
periphery. The axon terminates on muscle fibers at the neuromuscular junction. Acetylcholine is released at this specialized
synapse, which causes the muscle action potential to begin, following a large potential known as an end plate potential.
 When the lower motor neuron excites the muscle fiber, it contracts. All of this occurs in a fraction of a second, but this story
is the basis of how the nervous system functions.

Understanding how the nervous system works could be a driving force in your career. Studying neurophysiology is a
very rewarding path to follow. It means that there is a lot of work to do, but the rewards are worth the effort.
