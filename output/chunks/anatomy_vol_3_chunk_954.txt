The sacrum is derived from the fusion of five sacral vertebrae
and the coccyx is formed by the fusion of four small coccygeal vertebrae. 34 A typical vertebra consists of an anterior body and
a posterior vertebral arch. The body serves for weight bearing. The vertebral arch surrounds and protects the spinal cord. The
vertebral arch is formed by the pedicles, which are attached to the posterior side of the vertebral body, and the lamina, which
come together to form the top of the arch. A pair of transverse processes extends laterally from the vertebral arch, at the junction
between each pedicle and lamina. The spinous process extends posteriorly from the top of the arch. A pair of superior articular
processes project upward and a pair of inferior articular processes project downward. Together, the notches found in the margins
of the pedicles of adjacent vertebrae form an intervertebral foramen. 35 The sacrum is a single, triangular-shaped bone formed by
the fusion of five sacral vertebrae.
