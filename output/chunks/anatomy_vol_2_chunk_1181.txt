Water moves by osmosis.

 Bulk Flow

The mass movement of fluids into and out of capillary beds requires a transport mechanism far more efficient than mere
diffusion. This movement, often referred to as bulk flow, involves two pressure-driven mechanisms: Volumes of fluid move
from an area of higher pressure in a capillary bed to an area of lower pressure in the tissues via filtration. In contrast,
the movement of fluid from an area of higher pressure in the tissues into an area of lower pressure in the capillaries is
reabsorption. Two types of pressure interact to drive each of these movements: hydrostatic pressure and osmotic pressure.

 Hydrostatic Pressure

The primary force driving fluid transport between the capillaries and tissues is hydrostatic pressure, which can be defined
as the pressure of any fluid enclosed in a space. Blood hydrostatic pressure is the force exerted by the blood confined
within blood vessels or heart chambers. Even more specifically, the pressure exerted by blood against the wall of a capillary
is called capillary hydrostatic pressure (CHP), and is the same as capillary blood pressure.
