It is the sensory component of the jaw-jerk reflex, a stretch reflex of the masseter muscle. The chief nucleus,
located in the pons, receives information about light touch as well as proprioceptive information about the mandible, which
are both relayed to the thalamus and, ultimately, to the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe. The spinal trigeminal nucleus,
located in the medulla, receives information about crude touch, pain, and temperature to be relayed to the thalamus and

cortex. Essentially, the projection through the chief nucleus is analogous to the dorsal column pathway for the body, and the
projection through the spinal trigeminal nucleus is analogous to the spinothalamic pathway.

 Subtests for the sensory component of the trigeminal system are the same as those for the sensory exam targeting the
spinal nerves. The primary sensory subtest for the trigeminal system is sensory discrimination. A cotton-tipped applicator,
which is cotton attached to the end of a thin wooden stick, can be used easily for this.
