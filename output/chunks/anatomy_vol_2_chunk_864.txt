The kidneys also remove any circulating bilirubin and other related metabolic byproducts
such as urobilins and secrete them into the urine.

 The breakdown pigments formed from the destruction of hemoglobin can be seen in a variety of situations. At the site
of an injury, biliverdin from damaged RBCs produces some of the dramatic colors associated with bruising. With a failing
liver, bilirubin cannot be removed effectively from circulation and causes the body to assume a yellowish tinge associated
with jaundice. Stercobilins within the feces produce the typical brown color associated with this waste. And the yellow of
urine is associated with the urobilins.

 The erythrocyte lifecycle is summarized in Figure 18.8.
