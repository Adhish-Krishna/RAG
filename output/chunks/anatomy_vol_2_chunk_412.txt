The pathways of the extrapyramidal system are influenced by subcortical structures. For example, connections between
the secondary motor cortices and the extrapyramidal system modulate spine and cranium movements. The basal nuclei,
which are important for regulating movement initiated by the CNS, influence the extrapyramidal system as well as its
thalamic feedback to the motor cortex.

 The conscious movement of our muscles is more complicated than simply sending a single command from the
precentral gyrus down to the proper motor neurons. During the movement of any body part, our muscles relay information
back to the brain, and the brain is constantly sending “revised” instructions back to the muscles. The cerebellum is important
in contributing to the motor system because it compares cerebral motor commands with proprioceptive feedback. The
corticospinal fibers that project to the ventral horn of the spinal cord have branches that also synapse in the pons, which
project to the cerebellum.
