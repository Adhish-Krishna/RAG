But many chemical
reactions take time. A variety of factors influence the rate of chemical reactions. This section, however, will consider only
the most important in human functioning.

 Properties of the Reactants

If chemical reactions are to occur quickly, the atoms in the reactants have to have easy access to one another. Thus, the
greater the surface area of the reactants, the more readily they will interact. When you pop a cube of cheese into your mouth,
you chew it before you swallow it. Among other things, chewing increases the surface area of the food so that digestive
chemicals can more easily get at it. As a general rule, gases tend to react faster than liquids or solids, again because it takes
energy to separate particles of a substance, and gases by definition already have space between their particles.
