Some collateral branches of the tract will project into the ipsilateral ventral horn to control synergistic muscles
on that side of the body, or to inhibit antagonistic muscles through interneurons within the ventral horn. Through the
influence of both sides of the body, the anterior corticospinal tract can coordinate postural muscles in broad movements
of the body. These coordinating axons in the anterior corticospinal tract are often considered bilateral, as they are both
ipsilateral and contralateral.

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/motorpathway) to learn more about the descending motor pathway
for the somatic nervous system. The autonomic connections are mentioned, which are covered in another chapter.
 From this brief video, only some of the descending motor pathway of the somatic nervous system is described. Which
division of the pathway is described and which division is left out?

 Extrapyramidal Controls

Other descending connections between the brain and the spinal cord are called the extrapyramidal system.
