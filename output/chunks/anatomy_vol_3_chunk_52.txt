Likewise, if volume decreases, pressure
increases. Pressure and volume are inversely related (P = k/V). Therefore, the pressure in the one-liter container (one-half

volume of the two-liter container) would be twice the pressure in the two-liter container. Boyle’s law is expressed by t
lowing formula:
Pi Vi =PoV2

In this formula, P; represents the initial pressure and Vj represents the initial volume, whereas the final pressure and
