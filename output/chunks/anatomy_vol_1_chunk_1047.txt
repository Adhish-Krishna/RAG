Lactic acid buildup may lower intracellular pH, affecting enzyme and protein activity. Imbalances in Na*
and K* levels as a result of membrane depolarization may disrupt Ca*” flow out of the SR. Long periods of sustained

exercise may damage the SR and the sarcolemma, resulting in impaired Ca’ ~ regulation.

 Intense muscle activity results in an oxygen debt, which is the amount of oxygen needed to compensate for ATP
produced without oxygen during muscle contraction. Oxygen is required to restore ATP and creatine phosphate levels,
convert lactic acid to pyruvic acid, and, in the liver, to convert lactic acid into glucose or glycogen. Other systems used
during exercise also require oxygen, and all of these combined processes result in the increased breathing rate that occurs
after exercise. Until the oxygen debt has been met, oxygen intake is elevated, even after exercise has stopped.

 Relaxation of a Skeletal Muscle

Relaxing skeletal muscle fibers, and ultimately, the skeletal muscle, begins with the motor neuron, which stops releasing
its chemical signal, ACh, into the synapse at the NMJ.
