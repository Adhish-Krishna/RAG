They usually consist of six or fewer amino acid residues in a protein, or one
or two sugar moieties in a carbohydrate antigen. Antigenic determinants on a carbohydrate antigen are usually less diverse
than on a protein antigen. Carbohydrate antigens are found on bacterial cell walls and on red blood cells (the ABO blood
group antigens). Protein antigens are complex because of the variety of three-dimensional shapes that proteins can assume,
and are especially important for the immune responses to viruses and worm parasites. It is the interaction of the shape of the
antigen and the complementary shape of the amino acids of the antigen-binding site that accounts for the chemical basis of
specificity (Figure 21.16).

Figure 21.16 Antigenic Determinants A typical protein antigen has multiple antigenic determinants, shown by the
ability of T cells with three different specificities to bind to different parts of the same antigen.
