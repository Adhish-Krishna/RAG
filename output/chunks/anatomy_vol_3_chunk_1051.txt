decrease in metabolism. 31 Addisonâ€™s disease is characterized by low cortisol levels. One way to treat the disease is by giving
cortisol to the patient. 32 Glucose is oxidized during glycolysis, creating pyruvate, which is processed through the Krebs cycle
to produce NADH, FADH2, ATP, and CO2. The FADH2 and NADH yield ATP. 33 Upon entry into the cell, hexokinase or
glucokinase phosphorylates glucose, converting it into glucose-6-phosphate. In this form, glucose-6-phosphate is trapped in the
cell. Because all of the glucose has been phosphorylated, new glucose molecules can be transported into the cell according to its
concentration gradient. 34 Carbohydrates are converted into pyruvate during glycolysis. This pyruvate is converted into acetyl
CoA and proceeds through the Krebs cycle. When excess acetyl CoA is produced that cannot be processed through the Krebs
cycle, the acetyl CoA is converted into triglycerides and fatty acids to be stored in the liver and adipose tissue.
