26.5 Disorders of Acid-Base Balance

Acidosis and alkalosis describe conditions in which a person's blood is, respectively, too acidic (pH below 7.35) and too
alkaline (pH above 7.45). Each of these conditions can be caused either by metabolic problems related to bicarbonate levels
or by respiratory problems related to carbonic acid and CO2 levels. Several compensatory mechanisms allow the body to
maintain a normal pH.
