Ribs

Each rib is a curved, flattened bone that contributes to the wall of the thorax. The ribs articulate posteriorly with the T1-T12
thoracic vertebrae, and most attach anteriorly via their costal cartilages to the sternum. There are 12 pairs of ribs. The ribs
are numbered 1â€”12 in accordance with the thoracic vertebrae.

 Parts of a Typical Rib

The posterior end of a typical rib is called the head of the rib (see Figure 7.27). This region articulates primarily with
the costal facet located on the body of the same numbered thoracic vertebra and to a lesser degree, with the costal facet
located on the body of the next higher vertebra. Lateral to the head is the narrowed neck of the rib. A small bump on the
posterior rib surface is the tubercle of the rib, which articulates with the facet located on the transverse process of the same
numbered vertebra.
