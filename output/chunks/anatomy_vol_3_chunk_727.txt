Without progesterone, the endometrium thins and, under
the influence of prostaglandins, the spiral arteries of the endometrium constrict and rupture, preventing oxygenated blood
from reaching the endometrial tissue. As a result, endometrial tissue dies and blood, pieces of the endometrial tissue, and
white blood cells are shed through the vagina during menstruation, or the menses. The first menses after puberty, called
menarche, can occur either before or after the first ovulation.

 The Menstrual Cycle

ow that we have discussed the maturation of the cohort of tertiary follicles in the ovary, the build-up and then shedding
of the endometrial lining in the uterus, and the function of the uterine tubes and vagina, we can put everything together to
talk about the three phases of the menstrual cycleâ€”the series of changes in which the uterine lining is shed, rebuilds, and
prepares for implantation.
