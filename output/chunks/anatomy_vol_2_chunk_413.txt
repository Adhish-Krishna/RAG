Also, the proprioceptive sensations of the dorsal column system have a collateral projection to the
medulla that projects to the cerebellum. These two streams of information are compared in the cerebellar cortex. Conflicts
between the motor commands sent by the cerebrum and body position information provided by the proprioceptors cause the
cerebellum to stimulate the red nucleus of the midbrain. The red nucleus then sends corrective commands to the spinal cord
along the rubrospinal tract. The name of this tract comes from the word for red that is seen in the English word “ruby.”

A good example of how the cerebellum corrects cerebral motor commands can be illustrated by walking in water. An
original motor command from the cerebrum to walk will result in a highly coordinated set of learned movements. However,
in water, the body cannot actually perform a typical walking movement as instructed. The cerebellum can alter the motor
command, stimulating the leg muscles to take larger steps to overcome the water resistance.
