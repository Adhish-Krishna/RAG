The large levator ani consists of two skeletal muscles, the pubococcygeus and the iliococcygeus (Figure 11.19). The
levator ani is considered the most important muscle of the pelvic floor because it supports the pelvic viscera. It resists the
pressure produced by contraction of the abdominal muscles so that the pressure is applied to the colon to aid in defecation
and to the uterus to aid in childbirth (assisted by the ischiococcygeus, which pulls the coccyx anteriorly). This muscle also
creates skeletal muscle sphincters at the urethra and anus.
