Along with this inspection, muscle tone
is assessed by moving the muscles through a passive range of motion. The arm is moved at the elbow and wrist, and the
leg is moved at the knee and ankle. Skeletal muscle should have a resting tension representing a slight contraction of the
‘ibers. The lack of muscle tone, known as hypotonicity or flaccidity, may indicate that the LMN is not conducting action
potentials that will keep a basal level of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction.

CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 671

If muscle tone is present, muscle strength is tested by having the patient contract muscles against resistance. The
examiner will ask the patient to lift the arm, for example, while the examiner is pushing down on it. This is done for both
limbs, including shrugging the shoulders. Lateral differences in strength—being able to push against resistance with the
right arm but not the left—would indicate a deficit in one corticospinal tract versus the other.
