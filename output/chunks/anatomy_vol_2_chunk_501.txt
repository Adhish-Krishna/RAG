When light hits
the retina in one eye, both pupils contract. When that light is removed, both pupils dilate again back to the resting position.
 When the stimulus is unilateral (presented to only one eye), the response is bilateral (both eyes). The same is not true for
somatic reflexes. If you touch a hot radiator, you only pull that arm back, not both. Central control of autonomic reflexes is
different than for somatic reflexes. The hypothalamus, along with other CNS locations, controls the autonomic system.
