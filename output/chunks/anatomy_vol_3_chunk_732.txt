Over the next 10 to 12 days, the endometrial glands secrete a fluid rich in glycogen. If
fertilization has occurred, this fluid will nourish the ball of cells now developing from the zygote. At the same time, the
spiral arteries develop to provide blood to the thickened stratum functionalis.

 If no pregnancy occurs within approximately 10 to 12 days, the corpus luteum will degrade into the corpus albicans.
 Levels of both estrogen and progesterone will fall, and the endometrium will grow thinner. Prostaglandins will be
secreted that cause constriction of the spiral arteries, reducing oxygen supply. The endometrial tissue will die, resulting in
mensesâ€”or the first day of the next cycle.
