Nucleic acids are present in most of the foods you eat. During digestion, nucleic acids including DNA and various
RNAs are broken down into their constituent nucleotides. These nucleotides are readily absorbed and transported
throughout the body to be used by individual cells during nucleic acid metabolism.

 Anabolic Reactions

 In contrast to catabolic reactions, anabolic reactions involve the joining of smaller molecules into larger ones. Anabolic
reactions combine monosaccharides to form polysaccharides, fatty acids to form triglycerides, amino acids to form proteins,
and nucleotides to form nucleic acids. These processes require energy in the form of ATP molecules generated by catabolic
reactions. Anabolic reactions, also called biosynthesis reactions, create new molecules that form new cells and tissues, and
revitalize organs.

Hormonal Regulation of Metabolism

Catabolic and anabolic hormones in the body help regulate metabolic processes.
