(a) Mesenchymal cells
differentiate into chondrocytes. (b) The cartilage model of the future bony skeleton and the perichondrium form.
(c) Capillaries penetrate cartilage. Perichondrium transforms into periosteum. Periosteal collar develops. Primary
ossification center develops. (d) Cartilage and chondrocytes continue to grow at ends of the bone. (e) Secondary
ossification centers develop. (f) Cartilage remains at epiphyseal (growth) plate and at joint surface as articular cartilage.

 As more matrix is produced, the chondrocytes in the center of the cartilaginous model grow in size. As the matrix
calcifies, nutrients can no longer reach the chondrocytes. This results in their death and the disintegration of the surrounding
cartilage. Blood vessels invade the resulting spaces, not only enlarging the cavities but also carrying osteogenic cells with
them, many of which will become osteoblasts. These enlarging spaces eventually combine to become the medullary cavity.
