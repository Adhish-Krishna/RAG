Axons from the peripheral sensory organs, or intermediate nuclei, synapse in the thalamus, and thalamic neurons
project directly to the cerebrum. It is a requisite synapse in any sensory pathway, except for olfaction. The thalamus does

not just pass the information on, it also processes that information. For example, the portion of the thalamus that receives
visual information will influence what visual stimuli are important, or what receives attention.

 The cerebrum also sends information down to the thalamus, which usually communicates motor commands. This
involves interactions with the cerebellum and other nuclei in the brain stem. The cerebrum interacts with the basal nuclei,
which involves connections with the thalamus. The primary output of the basal nuclei is to the thalamus, which relays that
output to the cerebral cortex. The cortex also sends information to the thalamus that will then influence the effects of the
basal nuclei.
