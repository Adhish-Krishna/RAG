It is not until the placenta is expelled that this inhibition is lifted and
milk production commences.
 After childbirth, the baseline prolactin level drops sharply, but it is restored for a 1-hour spike during each feeding to
stimulate the production of milk for the next feeding. With each prolactin spike, estrogen and progesterone also increase
slightly.
 When the infant suckles, sensory nerve fibers in the areola trigger a neuroendocrine reflex that results in milk secretion
from lactocytes into the alveoli. The posterior pituitary releases oxytocin, which stimulates myoepithelial cells to squeeze
milk from the alveoli so it can drain into the lactiferous ducts, collect in the lactiferous sinuses, and discharge through
the nipple pores. It takes less than 1 minute from the time when an infant begins suckling (the latent period) until milk is
secreted (the let-down). Figure 28.23 summarizes the positive feedback loop of the let-down reflex.
