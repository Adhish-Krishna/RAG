Other mesoderm cells differentiate into the
somites, the precursors of the axial skeleton and
skeletal muscle.

Figure 28.13 Neurulation The embryonic process of neurulation establishes the rudiments of the future central
nervous system and skeleton.

 The embryo, which begins as a flat sheet of cells, begins to acquire a cylindrical shape through the process of
embryonic folding (Figure 28.14). The embryo folds laterally and again at either end, forming a C-shape with distinct
head and tail ends. The embryo envelops a portion of the yolk sac, which protrudes with the umbilical cord from what will
become the abdomen. The folding essentially creates a tube, called the primitive gut, that is lined by the endoderm. The
amniotic sac, which was sitting on top of the flat embryo, envelops the embryo as it folds.
