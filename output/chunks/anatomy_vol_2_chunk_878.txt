Classification of Leukocytes

When scientists first began to observe stained blood slides, it quickly became evident that leukocytes could be divided into
two groups, according to whether their cytoplasm contained highly visible granules:

¢ Granular leukocytes contain abundant granules within the cytoplasm. They include neutrophils, eosinophils, and
basophils (you can view their lineage from myeloid stem cells in Figure 18.4).

¢ While granules are not totally lacking in agranular leukocytes, they are far fewer and less obvious. Agranular
leukocytes include monocytes, which mature into macrophages that are phagocytic, and lymphocytes, which arise
from the lymphoid stem cell line.

 Granular Leukocytes

We will consider the granular leukocytes in order from most common to least common. All of these are produced in the red
bone marrow and have a short lifespan of hours to days. They typically have a lobed nucleus and are classified according to
which type of stain best highlights their granules (Figure 18.11).
