The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers
than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) at the
neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves. NE shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization

and contraction, which results in an increase in HR. It opens chemical- or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels,
allowing an influx of positively charged ions.

 NE binds to the beta-1 receptor. Some cardiac medications (for example, beta blockers) work by blocking these
receptors, thereby slowing HR and are one possible treatment for hypertension. Overprescription of these drugs may lead to
bradycardia and even stoppage of the heart.

 Vagus nerve
(parasympathetic)
decreases heart rate.

 Sympathetic cardiac nerves

increase heart rate and
force of contraction.
