Figure 14.27 Phineas Gage _ The victim of an accident while working on a railroad in 1848, Phineas Gage had a large
iron rod impaled through the prefrontal cortex of his frontal lobe. After the accident, his personality appeared to change,
but he eventually learned to cope with the trauma and lived as a coach driver even after such a traumatic event. (credit

Secondary Motor Cortices

In generating motor responses, the executive functions of the prefrontal cortex will need to initiate actual movements. One
way to define the prefrontal area is any region of the frontal lobe that does not elicit movement when electrically stimulated.
 These are primarily in the anterior part of the frontal lobe. The regions of the frontal lobe that remain are the regions of the
cortex that produce movement. The prefrontal areas project into the secondary motor cortices, which include the premotor
cortex and the supplemental motor area.
