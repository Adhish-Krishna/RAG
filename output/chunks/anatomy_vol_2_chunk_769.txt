* Describe the location and structure of the pineal gland
* Discuss the function of melatonin

Recall that the hypothalamus, part of the diencephalon of the brain, sits inferior and somewhat anterior to the thalamus.
 Inferior but somewhat posterior to the thalamus is the pineal gland, a tiny endocrine gland whose functions are not entirely
clear. The pinealocyte cells that make up the pineal gland are known to produce and secrete the amine hormone melatonin,
which is derived from serotonin.

 The secretion of melatonin varies according to the level of light received from the environment. When photons of light
stimulate the retinas of the eyes, a nerve impulse is sent to a region of the hypothalamus called the suprachiasmatic nucleus
(SCN), which is important in regulating biological rhythms. From the SCN, the nerve signal is carried to the spinal cord and
eventually to the pineal gland, where the production of melatonin is inhibited.
