Extrinsic Pathway

The quicker responding and more direct extrinsic pathway (also known as the tissue factor pathway) begins when
damage occurs to the surrounding tissues, such as in a traumatic injury. Upon contact with blood plasma, the damaged

extravascular cells, which are extrinsic to the bloodstream, release factor III (thromboplastin). Sequentially, Ca** then factor
VII (proconvertin), which is activated by factor III, are added, forming an enzyme complex. This enzyme complex leads
to activation of factor X (Stuartâ€”Prower factor), which activates the common pathway discussed below. The events in the
extrinsic pathway are completed in a matter of seconds.

 Intrinsic Pathway

The intrinsic pathway (also known as the contact activation pathway) is longer and more complex. In this case, the factors
involved are intrinsic to (present within) the bloodstream. The pathway can be prompted by damage to the tissues, resulting
from internal factors such as arterial disease; however, it is most often initiated when factor XII (Hageman factor) comes
into contact with foreign materials, such as when a blood sample is put into a glass test tube.
