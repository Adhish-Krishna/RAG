The result is the creation of a filtrate that does not contain cells or large
proteins, and has a slight predominance of positively charged substances.

 Lying just outside Bowman’s capsule and the glomerulus is the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) (Figure 25.13).
 At the juncture where the afferent and efferent arterioles enter and leave Bowman’s capsule, the initial part of the distal
convoluted tubule (DCT) comes into direct contact with the arterioles. The wall of the DCT at that point forms a part of the
JGA known as the macula densa. This cluster of cuboidal epithelial cells monitors the fluid composition of fluid flowing

through the DCT. In response to the concentration of Na’ in the fluid flowing past them, these cells release paracrine signals.
 They also have a single, nonmotile cilium that responds to the rate of fluid movement in the tubule. The paracrine signals

released in response to changes in flow rate and Na” concentration are adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine.
