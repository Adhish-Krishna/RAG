To allow these capillary networks to supply the deep portions
of the muscle, muscle mass does not greatly increase in order to maintain a smaller area for the diffusion of nutrients and
gases. All of these cellular changes result in the ability to sustain low levels of muscle contractions for greater periods
without fatiguing.
 The proportion of SO muscle fibers in muscle determines the suitability of that muscle for endurance, and may benefit
those participating in endurance activities. Postural muscles have a large number of SO fibers and relatively few FO and
FG fibers, to keep the back straight (Figure 10.18). Endurance athletes, like marathon-runners also would benefit from a
larger proportion of SO fibers, but it is unclear if the most-successful marathoners are those with naturally high numbers
of SO fibers, or whether the most successful marathon runners develop high numbers of SO fibers with repetitive training.
