The ovaries produce oocytes, the female gametes, in a process called oogenesis. As with spermatogenesis, meiosis
produces the haploid gamete (in this case, an ovum); however, it is completed only in an oocyte that has been penetrated by
a sperm. In the ovary, an oocyte surrounded by supporting cells is called a follicle. In folliculogenesis, primordial follicles
develop into primary, secondary, and tertiary follicles. Early tertiary follicles with their fluid-filled antrum will be stimulated
by an increase in FSH, a gonadotropin produced by the anterior pituitary, to grow in the 28-day ovarian cycle. Supporting
granulosa and theca cells in the growing follicles produce estrogens, until the level of estrogen in the bloodstream is high
enough that it triggers negative feedback at the hypothalamus and pituitary. This results in a reduction of FSH and LH, and
most tertiary follicles in the ovary undergo atresia (they die).
