They release a watery sweat, mixed with some metabolic waste and antibodies. Apocrine glands are associated with hair
follicles. They are larger than eccrine sweat glands and lie deeper in the dermis, sometimes even reaching the hypodermis. They
release a thicker sweat that is often decomposed by bacteria on the skin, resulting in an unpleasant odor. 28 Nails are composed
of densely packed dead keratinocytes. They protect the fingers and toes from mechanical stress. The nail body is formed on the
nail bed, which is at the nail root. Nail folds, folds of skin that overlap the nail on its side, secure the nail to the body. The
crescent-shaped region at the base of the nail is the lunula. 29 Sweating cools the body when it becomes warm. When the body
temperature rises, such as when exercising on a hot day, the dermal blood vessels dilate, and the sweat glands begin to secrete
more sweat.
