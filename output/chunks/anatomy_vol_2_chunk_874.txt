Platelets are essential for the repair of blood vessels when damage to them has occurred; they also provide growth
factors for healing and repair. See Figure 18.5 for a summary of leukocytes and platelets.

 Characteristics of Leukocytes

Although leukocytes and erythrocytes both originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, they are very
different from each other in many significant ways. For instance, leukocytes are far less numerous than erythrocytes:
Typically there are only 5000 to 10,000 per wL. They are also larger than erythrocytes and are the only formed elements that
are complete cells, possessing a nucleus and organelles. And although there is just one type of erythrocyte, there are many
types of leukocytes. Most of these types have a much shorter lifespan than that of erythrocytes, some as short as a few hours
or even a few minutes in the case of acute infection.
