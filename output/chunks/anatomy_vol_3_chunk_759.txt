Organs called gonads produce the gametes, along with
the hormones that regulate human reproduction. The male gametes are called sperm. Spermatogenesis, the production of
sperm, occurs within the seminiferous tubules that make up most of the testis. The scrotum is the muscular sac that holds
the testes outside of the body cavity.
 Spermatogenesis begins with mitotic division of spermatogonia (stem cells) to produce primary spermatocytes that
undergo the two divisions of meiosis to become secondary spermatocytes, then the haploid spermatids. During
spermiogenesis, spermatids are transformed into spermatozoa (formed sperm). Upon release from the seminiferous tubules,
sperm are moved to the epididymis where they continue to mature. During ejaculation, sperm exit the epididymis through
the ductus deferens, a duct in the spermatic cord that leaves the scrotum. The ampulla of the ductus deferens meets the
seminal vesicle, a gland that contributes fructose and proteins, at the ejaculatory duct.
