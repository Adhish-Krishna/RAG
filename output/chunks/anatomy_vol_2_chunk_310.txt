Gustation (Taste)

Only a few recognized submodalities exist within the sense of taste, or gustation. Until recently, only four tastes were
recognized: sweet, salty, sour, and bitter. Research at the turn of the 20th century led to recognition of the fifth taste, umami,
during the mid-1980s. Umami is a Japanese word that means “delicious taste,” and is often translated to mean savory. Very
recent research has suggested that there may also be a sixth taste for fats, or lipids.

 Gustation is the special sense associated with the tongue. The surface of the tongue, along with the rest of the oral
cavity, is lined by a stratified squamous epithelium. Raised bumps called papillae (singular = papilla) contain the structures
for gustatory transduction. There are four types of papillae, based on their appearance (Figure 14.3): circumvallate, foliate,
filiform, and fungiform.
