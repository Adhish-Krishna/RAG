In clinical practice, this pressure is measured in mm Hg and is usually obtained using the brachial artery of the arm.

 Components of Arterial Blood Pressure

Arterial blood pressure in the larger vessels consists of several distinct components (Figure 20.10): systolic and diastolic
pressures, pulse pressure, and mean arterial pressure.

 Systolic and Diastolic Pressures

When systemic arterial blood pressure is measured, it is recorded as a ratio of two numbers (e.g., 120/80 is a normal adult
blood pressure), expressed as systolic pressure over diastolic pressure. The systolic pressure is the higher value (typically
around 120 mm Hg) and reflects the arterial pressure resulting from the ejection of blood during ventricular contraction, or
systole. The diastolic pressure is the lower value (usually about 80 mm Hg) and represents the arterial pressure of blood
during ventricular relaxation, or diastole.
