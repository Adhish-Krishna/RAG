Multiple venules join to form veins. The walls of venules consist of endothelium,
a thin middle layer with a few muscle cells and elastic fibers, plus an outer layer of connective tissue fibers that constitute
a very thin tunica externa (Figure 20.7). Venules as well as capillaries are the primary sites of emigration or diapedesis, in
which the white blood cells adhere to the endothelial lining of the vessels and then squeeze through adjacent cells to enter
the tissue fluid.

 Veins

A vein is a blood vessel that conducts blood toward the heart. Compared to arteries, veins are thin-walled vessels with large
and irregular lumens (see Figure 20.7). Because they are low-pressure vessels, larger veins are commonly equipped with
valves that promote the unidirectional flow of blood toward the heart and prevent backflow toward the capillaries caused
by the inherent low blood pressure in veins as well as the pull of gravity.
