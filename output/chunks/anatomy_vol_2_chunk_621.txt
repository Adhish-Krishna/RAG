Watch this short video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/facialnerve) to see an examination of the facial nerve using some
simple tests. The facial nerve controls the muscles of facial expression. Severe deficits will be obvious in watching
someone use those muscles for normal control. One side of the face might not move like the other side. But directed
tests, especially for contraction against resistance, require a formal testing of the muscles. The muscles of the upper
and lower face need to be tested. The strength test in this video involves the patient squeezing her eyes shut and the
examiner trying to pry her eyes open. Why does the examiner ask her to try a second time?

Motor Nerves of the Neck

The accessory nerve, also referred to as the spinal accessory nerve, innervates the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius
muscles (Figure 16.11).
