Hyperpolarization in a postsynaptic potential is an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) because it causes the
membrane potential to move away from threshold.

 Summation

All types of graded potentials will result in small changes of either depolarization or hyperpolarization in the voltage of
a membrane. These changes can lead to the neuron reaching threshold if the changes add together, or summate. The
combined effects of different types of graded potentials are illustrated in Figure 12.26. If the total change in voltage in the
membrane is a positive 15 mV, meaning that the membrane depolarizes from -70 mV to -55 mV, then the graded potentials
will result in the membrane reaching threshold.

 For receptor potentials, threshold is not a factor because the change in membrane potential for receptor cells directly
causes neurotransmitter release. However, generator potentials can initiate action potentials in the sensory neuron axon, and
postsynaptic potentials can initiate an action potential in the axon of other neurons.
