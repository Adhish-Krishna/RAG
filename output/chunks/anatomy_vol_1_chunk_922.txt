Lateral flexion is the bending of the neck or body toward the right or left side. These movements of the
vertebral column involve both the symphysis joint formed by each intervertebral disc, as well as the plane type of synovial
joint formed between the inferior articular processes of one vertebra and the superior articular processes of the next lower
vertebra.

 In the limbs, flexion decreases the angle between the bones (bending of the joint), while extension increases the angle
and straightens the joint. For the upper limb, all anterior-going motions are flexion and all posterior-going motions are
extension. These include anterior-posterior movements of the arm at the shoulder, the forearm at the elbow, the hand at the
wrist, and the fingers at the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints. For the thumb, extension moves the thumb
away from the palm of the hand, within the same plane as the palm, while flexion brings the thumb back against the
index finger or into the palm.
