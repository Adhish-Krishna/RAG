The neurons of cranial nerve ganglia are also
unipolar in shape with associated satellite cells.

 The other major category of ganglia are those of the autonomic nervous system, which is divided into the sympathetic
and parasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic chain ganglia constitute a row of ganglia along the vertebral
column that receive central input from the lateral horn of the thoracic and upper lumbar spinal cord. Superior to the
chain ganglia are three paravertebral ganglia in the cervical region. Three other autonomic ganglia that are related to the
sympathetic chain are the prevertebral ganglia, which are located outside of the chain but have similar functions. They
are referred to as prevertebral because they are anterior to the vertebral column. The neurons of these autonomic ganglia
are multipolar in shape, with dendrites radiating out around the cell body where synapses from the spinal cord neurons
are made. The neurons of the chain, paravertebral, and prevertebral ganglia then project to organs in the head and neck,
thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic cavities to regulate the sympathetic aspect of homeostatic mechanisms.
