¢ Electrical energy, supplied by electrolytes in cells and body fluids, contributes to the voltage changes that help transmit
impulses in nerve and muscle cells.

 Characteristics of Chemical Reactions

All chemical reactions begin with a reactant, the general term for the one or more substances that enter into the reaction.
 Sodium and chloride ions, for example, are the reactants in the production of table salt. The one or more substances
produced by a chemical reaction are called the product.

 In chemical reactions, the components of the reactants—the elements involved and the number of atoms of each—are
all present in the product(s). Similarly, there is nothing present in the products that are not present in the reactants. This is
because chemical reactions are governed by the law of conservation of mass, which states that matter cannot be created or
destroyed in a chemical reaction.
