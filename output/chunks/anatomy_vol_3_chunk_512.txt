This has two significant effects: Removal of Na” while retaining

water leads to a hypotonic filtrate by the time it reaches the DCT; pumping Na’ into the interstitial space contributes to the
hyperosmotic environment in the kidney medulla.

 The Na“K* ATPase pumps in the basal membrane create an electrochemical gradient, allowing reabsorption of Cl”
by Na*/CI- symporters in the apical membrane. At the same time that Na’ is actively pumped from the basal side of the

cell into the interstitial fluid, CI” follows the Na” from the lumen into the interstitial fluid by a paracellular route between
cells through leaky tight junctions. These are found between cells of the ascending loop, where they allow certain solutes
to move according to their concentration gradient. Most of the K* that enters the cell via symporters returns to the lumen
(down its concentration gradient) through leaky channels in the apical membrane.
