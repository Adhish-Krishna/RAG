Like next-door neighbors whose kids hang
out first at one home and then at the other, the atoms do not lose or gain electrons permanently. Instead, the electrons move
back and forth between the elements. Because of the close sharing of pairs of electrons (one electron from each of two
atoms), covalent bonds are stronger than ionic bonds.

 Nonpolar Covalent Bonds

Figure 2.9 shows several common types of covalent bonds. Notice that the two covalently bonded atoms typically share
just one or two electron pairs, though larger sharings are possible. The important concept to take from this is that in covalent
bonds, electrons in the outermost valence shell are shared to fill the valence shells of both atoms, ultimately stabilizing both
of the atoms involved. In a single covalent bond, a single electron is shared between two atoms, while in a double covalent
bond, two pairs of electrons are shared between two atoms.
