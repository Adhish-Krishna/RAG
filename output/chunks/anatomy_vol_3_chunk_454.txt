The urethra in both males and females begins inferior and central to the two ureteral openings forming the three points
of a triangular-shaped area at the base of the bladder called the trigone (Greek tri- = “triangle” and the root of the word
“trigonometry”). The urethra tracks posterior and inferior to the pubic symphysis (see Figure 25.3a). In both males and
females, the proximal urethra is lined by transitional epithelium, whereas the terminal portion is a nonkeratinized, stratified
squamous epithelium. In the male, pseudostratified columnar epithelium lines the urethra between these two cell types.
 Voiding is regulated by an involuntary autonomic nervous system-controlled internal urinary sphincter, consisting of
smooth muscle and voluntary skeletal muscle that forms the external urinary sphincter below it.

 Female Urethra

The external urethral orifice is embedded in the anterior vaginal wall inferior to the clitoris, superior to the vaginal opening
(introitus), and medial to the labia minora.
