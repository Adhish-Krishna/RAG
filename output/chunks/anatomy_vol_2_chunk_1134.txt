Sinusoids are found in the liver and spleen, bone marrow, lymph nodes (where they
carry lymph, not blood), and many endocrine glands including the pituitary and adrenal glands. Without these specialized
capillaries, these organs would not be able to provide their myriad of functions. For example, when bone marrow forms new
blood cells, the cells must enter the blood supply and can only do so through the large openings of a sinusoid capillary; they
cannot pass through the small openings of continuous or fenestrated capillaries. The liver also requires extensive specialized
sinusoid capillaries in order to process the materials brought to it by the hepatic portal vein from both the digestive tract and
spleen, and to release plasma proteins into circulation.

 Metarterioles and Capillary Beds

A metarteriole is a type of vessel that has structural characteristics of both an arteriole and a capillary. Slightly larger than
the typical capillary, the smooth muscle of the tunica media of the metarteriole is not continuous but forms rings of smooth
muscle (sphincters) prior to the entrance to the capillaries.
