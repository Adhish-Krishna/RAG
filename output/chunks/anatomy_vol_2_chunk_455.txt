The cervical ganglia are referred to as paravertebral ganglia, given their location adjacent to
prevertebral ganglia in the sympathetic chain.

 Not all axons from the central neurons terminate in the chain ganglia. Additional branches from the ventral nerve root
continue through the chain and on to one of the collateral ganglia as the greater splanchnic nerve or lesser splanchnic
nerve. For example, the greater splanchnic nerve at the level of T5 synapses with a collateral ganglion outside the chain
before making the connection to the postganglionic nerves that innervate the stomach (see Figure 15.3c).

 Collateral ganglia, also called prevertebral ganglia, are situated anterior to the vertebral column and receive inputs
from splanchnic nerves as well as central sympathetic neurons. They are associated with controlling organs in the abdominal
cavity, and are also considered part of the enteric nervous system. The three collateral ganglia are the celiac ganglion, the
superior mesenteric ganglion, and the inferior mesenteric ganglion (see Figure 15.2).
