When present, it is a persistent remnant of pancreatic development.

 Scattered through the sea of exocrine acini are small islands of endocrine cells, the islets of Langerhans. These vital
cells produce the hormones pancreatic polypeptide, insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin.

 Pancreatic Juice

[he pancreas produces over a liter of pancreatic juice each day. Unlike bile, it is clear and composed mostly of water
along with some salts, sodium bicarbonate, and several digestive enzymes. Sodium bicarbonate is responsible for the slight
alkalinity of pancreatic juice (pH 7.1 to 8.2), which serves to buffer the acidic gastric juice in chyme, inactivate pepsin from
the stomach, and create an optimal environment for the activity of pH-sensitive digestive enzymes in the small intestine.
