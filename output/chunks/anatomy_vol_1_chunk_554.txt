Long Bones

A long bone is one that is cylindrical in shape, being longer than it is wide. Keep in mind, however, that the term describes
the shape of a bone, not its size. Long bones are found in the arms (humerus, ulna, radius) and legs (femur, tibia, fibula), as
well as in the fingers (metacarpals, phalanges) and toes (metatarsals, phalanges). Long bones function as levers; they move

when muscles contract.
 Short Bones

A short bone is one that is cube-like in shape, being approximately equal in length, width, and thickness. The only short
bones in the human skeleton are in the carpals of the wrists and the tarsals of the ankles. Short bones provide stability and
support as well as some limited motion.

Flat Bones

The term “ flat bone” is somewhat of a misnomer because, although a flat bone is typically thin, it is also often curved.
