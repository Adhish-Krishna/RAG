Mechanisms of Cell Cycle Control

As the cell proceeds through its cycle, each phase involves certain processes that must be completed before the cell should
advance to the next phase. A checkpoint is a point in the cell cycle at which the cycle can be signaled to move forward or
stopped. At each of these checkpoints, different varieties of molecules provide the stop or go signals, depending on certain
conditions within the cell. A cyclin is one of the primary classes of cell cycle control molecules (Figure 3.33). A cyclin-
dependent kinase (CDK) is one of a group of molecules that work together with cyclins to determine progression past cell
checkpoints. By interacting with many additional molecules, these triggers push the cell cycle forward unless prevented
from doing so by “stop” signals, if for some reason the cell is not ready.
