Wound healing is slower in the elderly, accompanied by a higher frequency of infection as the capacity of the immune
system to fend off pathogen declines.

 Aging is also apparent at the cellular level because all cells experience changes with aging. Telomeres, regions of
the chromosomes necessary for cell division, shorten each time cells divide. As they do, cells are less able to divide and
regenerate. Because of alterations in cell membranes, transport of oxygen and nutrients into the cell and removal of carbon
dioxide and waste products from the cell are not as efficient in the elderly. Cells may begin to function abnormally, which
may lead to diseases associated with aging, including arthritis, memory issues, and some cancers.
