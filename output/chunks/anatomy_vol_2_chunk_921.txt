In this
laboratory test, called cross matching, a sample of blood of unknown type is placed into separate wells. Into one well a
small amount of anti-A antibody is added, and to another a small amount of anti-B antibody. If the antigen is present, the
antibodies will cause visible agglutination of the cells (Figure 18.16). The blood should also be tested for Rh antibodies.

Figure 18.16 Cross Matching Blood Types This sample of a commercially produced “bedside” card enables quick
typing of both a recipient’s and donor’s blood before transfusion. The card contains three reaction sites or wells. One
is coated with an anti-A antibody, one with an anti-B antibody, and one with an anti-D antibody (tests for the presence
of Rh factor D).
