tidal expiration, is the sum of the tidal volume and inspiratory reserve volume. On the other hand, the functional residual
capacity (FRC) is the amount of air that remains in the lung after a normal tidal expiration; it is the sum of expiratory
reserve volume and residual volume (see Figure 22.18).

 Explain how spirometry test results can be used to diagnose respiratory diseases or determine the effectiveness of
disease treatment.

 In addition to the air that creates respiratory volumes, the respiratory system also contains anatomical dead space,
which is air that is present in the airway that never reaches the alveoli and therefore never participates in gas exchange.
