39 The lab technician has not made an error. Blood type AB has both A and B surface antigens, and

neither anti-A nor anti-B antibodies circulating in the plasma. When anti-A antibodies (added to the

on AB erythrocytes, they will cause agglutination. Similarly, when anti-B antibodies contact B antigens on AB erythrocytes, they
will cause agglutination.

1 The pressure gradient between the atria and the ventricles is much greater than that between the ventricles and the pulmonary
trunk and aorta. Without the presence of the chordae tendineae and papillary muscles, the valves would be blown back (prolapsed)
into the atria and blood would regurgitae. 2D 3A 4A 5C 6B 7B 8C 9C 10D 11D 12D 13D 14B 15C 16

in the ventricles, there is an initial tendency for blood to flow back (regurgitate) to the atria.
