The actin sites are exposed after Ca”* enters the sarcoplasm from its SR storage to activate the
troponin-tropomyosin complex so that the tropomyosin shifts away from the sites. The cross-bridging of myposin heads
docking into actin-binding sites is followed by the “power stroke”—the sliding of the thin filaments by thick filaments. The
power strokes are powered by ATP. Ultimately, the sarcomeres, myofibrils, and muscle fibers shorten to produce movement.

 10.4 Nervous System Control of Muscle Tension

[he number of cross-bridges formed between actin and myosin determines the amount of tension produced by a muscle.
 The length of a sarcomere is optimal when the zone of overlap between thin and thick filaments is greatest. Muscles that are
stretched or compressed too greatly do not produce maximal amounts of power. A motor unit is formed by a motor neuron
and all of the muscle fibers that are innervated by that same motor neuron.
