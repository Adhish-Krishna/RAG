THE HEART

Figure 19.22 Standard Placement of ECG Leads Ina 12-lead ECG, six electrodes are placed on the chest, and
four electrodes are placed on the limbs.

 A normal ECG tracing is presented in Figure 19.23. Each component, segment, and interval is labeled and corresponds
to important electrical events, demonstrating the relationship between these events and contraction in the heart.

 There are five prominent points on the ECG: the P wave, the QRS complex, and the T wave. The small P wave
represents the depolarization of the atria. The atria begin contracting approximately 25 ms after the start of the P wave. The
large QRS complex represents the depolarization of the ventricles, which requires a much stronger electrical signal because
of the larger size of the ventricular cardiac muscle. The ventricles begin to contract as the QRS reaches the peak of the R
wave. Lastly, the T wave represents the repolarization of the ventricles. The repolarization of the atria occurs during the
QRS complex, which masks it on an ECG.
