Some substances move across the placenta by simple diffusion. Oxygen, carbon
dioxide, and any other lipid-soluble substances take this route. Other substances move across by facilitated diffusion. This
includes water-soluble glucose. The fetus has a high demand for amino acids and iron, and those substances are moved
across the placenta by active transport.

 Maternal and fetal blood does not commingle because blood cells cannot move across the placenta. This separation
prevents the mother’s cytotoxic T cells from reaching and subsequently destroying the fetus, which bears “non-self”
antigens. Further, it ensures the fetal red blood cells do not enter the mother’s circulation and trigger antibody development
(if they carry “non-self” antigens)—at least until the final stages of pregnancy or birth. This is the reason that, even in the

absence of preventive treatment, an Rh_ mother doesn’t develop antibodies that could cause hemolytic disease in her first

Rh" fetus.
