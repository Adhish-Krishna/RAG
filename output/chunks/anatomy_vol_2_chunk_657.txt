Coordinating these movements involves the motor
cortex communicating with the cerebellum through the pons and feedback through the thalamus to plan the movements.
 Visual cortex information is also part of the processing that occurs in the cerebrocerebellum while it is involved in guiding
movements of the finger or toe.

 Rapid, alternating movements are tested for the upper and lower extremities. The patient is asked to touch each finger
to their thumb, or to pat the palm of one hand on the back of the other, and then flip that hand over and alternate back-and-
forth. To test similar function in the lower extremities, the patient touches their heel to their shin near the knee and slides
it down toward the ankle, and then back again, repetitively. Rapid, alternating movements are part of speech as well. A
patient is asked to repeat the nonsense consonants “lah-kah-pah” to alternate movements of the tongue, lips, and palate.
