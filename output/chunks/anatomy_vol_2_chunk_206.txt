Many pervasive functions, such as language, are distributed globally around the cerebrum.

 Some of the support for this misconception has come from studies of split brains. A drastic way to deal with a
rare and devastating neurological condition (intractable epilepsy) is to separate the two hemispheres of the brain. After
sectioning the corpus callosum, a split-brained patient will have trouble producing verbal responses on the basis of
sensory information processed on the right side of the cerebrum, leading to the idea that the left side is responsible for
language function.

 However, there are well-documented cases of language functions lost from damage to the right side of the brain.
 The deficits seen in damage to the left side of the brain are classified as aphasia, a loss of speech function; damage on
the right side can affect the use of language.
