In the body, water moves through semi-permeable membranes of cells and from one compartment of the body to
another by a process called osmosis. Osmosis is basically the diffusion of water from regions of higher concentration to
regions of lower concentration, along an osmotic gradient across a semi-permeable membrane. As a result, water will
move into and out of cells and tissues, depending on the relative concentrations of the water and solutes found there. An
appropriate balance of solutes inside and outside of cells must be maintained to ensure normal function.

 Body Water Content

Human beings are mostly water, ranging from about 75 percent of body mass in infants to about 50-60 percent in adult
men and women, to as low as 45 percent in old age. The percent of body water changes with development, because the
proportions of the body given over to each organ and to muscles, fat, bone, and other tissues change from infancy to
adulthood (Figure 26.2).
