Dissolved Carbon Dioxide

Although carbon dioxide is not considered to be highly soluble in blood, a small fraction—about 7 to 10 percent—of the
carbon dioxide that diffuses into the blood from the tissues dissolves in plasma. The dissolved carbon dioxide then travels
in the bloodstream and when the blood reaches the pulmonary capillaries, the dissolved carbon dioxide diffuses across the
respiratory membrane into the alveoli, where it is then exhaled during pulmonary ventilation.

Bicarbonate Buffer

A large fraction—about 70 percent—of the carbon dioxide molecules that diffuse into the blood is transported to the
lungs as bicarbonate. Most bicarbonate is produced in erythrocytes after carbon dioxide diffuses into the capillaries, and
subsequently into red blood cells. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) causes carbon dioxide and water to form carbonic acid

(H2CO3), which dissociates into two ions: bicarbonate (HCO3 ) and hydrogen (H*).
