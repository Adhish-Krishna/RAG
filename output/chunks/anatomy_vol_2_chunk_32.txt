The nervous system is a very complex organ system. In Peter D. Kramer’s book Listening to Prozac, a pharmaceutica
researcher is quoted as saying, “If the human brain were simple enough for us to understand, we would be too simple to
understand it” (1994). That quote is from the early 1990s; in the two decades since, progress has continued at an amazing
rate within the scientific disciplines of neuroscience.
