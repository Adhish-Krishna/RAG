detail.

 Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) consists of an aggregate of lymphoid follicles directly associated
with the mucous membrane epithelia. MALT makes up dome-shaped structures found underlying the mucosa of the
gastrointestinal tract, breast tissue, lungs, and eyes. Peyer’s patches, a type of MALT in the small intestine, are especially
important for immune responses against ingested substances (Figure 21.11). Peyer’s patches contain specialized endothelial
cells called M (or microfold) cells that sample material from the intestinal lumen and transport it to nearby follicles so that
adaptive immune responses to potential pathogens can be mounted.
