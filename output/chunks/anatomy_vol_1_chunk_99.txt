In the technique, a patient lies on a motorized platform while a computerized
axial tomography (CAT) scanner rotates 360 degrees around the patient, taking X-ray images. A computer combines these
images into a two-dimensional view of the scanned area, or “slice.”

Figure 1.19 Medical Imaging Techniques (a) The results of a CT scan of the head are shown as successive
transverse sections. (b) An MRI machine generates a magnetic field around a patient. (c) PET scans use
radiopharmaceuticals to create images of active blood flow and physiologic activity of the organ or organs being
targeted. (d) Ultrasound technology is used to monitor pregnancies because it is the least invasive of imaging
techniques and uses no electromagnetic radiation. (credit a: Akira Ohgaki/flickr; credit b: “Digital Cate”/flickr; credit c:

Since 1970, the development of more powerful computers and more sophisticated software has made CT scanning
routine for many types of diagnostic evaluations.
