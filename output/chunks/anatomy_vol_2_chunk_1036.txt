Occasional occurances are generally transitory and nonlife threatening, but if the condition becomes chronic, it
may lead to either an arrhythmia, a deviation from the normal pattern of impulse conduction and contraction, or to
fibrillation, an uncoordinated beating of the heart.

 While interpretation of an ECG is possible and extremely valuable after some training, a full understanding of
the complexities and intricacies generally requires several years of experience. In general, the size of the electrical
variations, the duration of the events, and detailed vector analysis provide the most comprehensive picture of cardiac
function. For example, an amplified P wave may indicate enlargement of the atria, an enlarged Q wave may indicate
a MI, and an enlarged suppressed or inverted Q wave often indicates enlarged ventricles. T waves often appear flatter
when insufficient oxygen is being delivered to the myocardium. An elevation of the ST segment above baseline is
often seen in patients with an acute MI, and may appear depressed below the baseline when hypoxia is occurring.
