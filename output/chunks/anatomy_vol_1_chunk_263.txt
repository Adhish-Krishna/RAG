The
glycocalyces found in a person’s body are products of that person’s genetic makeup. They give each of the individual’s
trillions of cells the “identity” of belonging in the person’s body. This identity is the primary way that a person’s immune
defense cells “know” not to attack the person’s own body cells, but it also is the reason organs donated by another person
might be rejected.

 Peripheral proteins are typically found on the inner or outer surface of the lipid bilayer but can also be attached to
the internal or external surface of an integral protein. These proteins typically perform a specific function for the cell. Some
peripheral proteins on the surface of intestinal cells, for example, act as digestive enzymes to break down nutrients to sizes
that can pass through the cells and into the bloodstream.
