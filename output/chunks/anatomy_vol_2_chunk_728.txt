Its primary function is anabolic; it promotes protein synthesis and tissue building through
direct and indirect mechanisms (Figure 17.10). GH levels are controlled by the release of GHRH and GHIH (also known
as somatostatin) from the hypothalamus.

 702 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

1) Release of growth hormone:
* Hypothalamus releases
growth hormone-releasing
hormone (GHRH)
 * GHRH stimulates the anterior
Pituitary to release growth
hormone (GH)

GH release

2a) Glucose-sparing effect:

* Stimulates adipose cells

to break down stored fat,
fueling growth effects

GHBH release 3) Inhibition of growth hormone:

* High IGF-1 levels perceived by
hypothalamus

* Growth hormone-inhibiting
hormone (GHIH) is released to
inhibit GH release

* GHIH inhibits GH release in the
anterior pituitary

GHIH release
