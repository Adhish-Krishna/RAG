Spatial and temporal summation can act together, as
well.

Figure 12.26 Postsynaptic Potential Summation The result of summation of postsynaptic potentials is the overall
change in the membrane potential. At point A, several different excitatory postsynaptic potentials add up to a large

depolarization. At point B, a mix of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials result in a different end result for
the membrane potential.

 Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/summation) to learn about summation. The process of converting
electrical signals to chemical signals and back requires subtle changes that can result in transient increases or decreases
in membrane voltage. To cause a lasting change in the target cell, multiple signals are usually added together, or
summated.
