Primary Lymphoid Organs and Lymphocyte Development

Understanding the differentiation and development of B and T cells is critical to the understanding of the adaptive immune
response. It is through this process that the body (ideally) learns to destroy only pathogens and leaves the bodyâ€™s own cells
relatively intact. The primary lymphoid organs are the bone marrow, spleen, and thymus gland. The lymphoid organs are
where lymphocytes mature, proliferate, and are selected, which enables them to attack pathogens without harming the cells
of the body.
