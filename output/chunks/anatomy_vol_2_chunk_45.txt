The CNS and the PNS both contribute to the same functions, but those functions can be attributed to different
regions of the brain (such as the cerebral cortex or the hypothalamus) or to different ganglia in the periphery. The problem
with trying to fit functional differences into anatomical divisions is that sometimes the same structure can be part of several
functions. For example, the optic nerve carries signals from the retina that are either used for the conscious perception
of visual stimuli, which takes place in the cerebral cortex, or for the reflexive responses of smooth muscle tissue that are
processed through the hypothalamus.

 There are two ways to consider how the nervous system is divided functionally. First, the basic functions of the nervous
system are sensation, integration, and response. Secondly, control of the body can be somatic or autonomicâ€”divisions that
are largely defined by the structures that are involved in the response.
