At fertilization, the chromosomes in one male gamete, called a sperm (or spermatozoon), combine
with the chromosomes in one female gamete, called an oocyte. The function of the male reproductive system (Figure 27.2)
is to produce sperm and transfer them to the female reproductive tract. The paired testes are a crucial component in this
process, as they produce both sperm and androgens, the hormones that support male reproductive physiology. In humans,
the most important male androgen is testosterone. Several accessory organs and ducts aid the process of sperm maturation
and transport the sperm and other seminal components to the penis, which delivers sperm to the female reproductive tract.
 In this section, we examine each of these different structures, and discuss the process of sperm production and transport.
