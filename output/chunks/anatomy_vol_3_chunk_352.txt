The six-carbon citrate molecule is systematically converted to a five-carbon molecule and then a four-carbon molecule,
ending with oxaloacetate, the beginning of the cycle. Along the way, each citrate molecule will produce one ATP, one
FADHg, and three NADH. The FADH2 and NADH will enter the oxidative phosphorylation system located in the inner
mitochondrial membrane. In addition, the Krebs cycle supplies the starting materials to process and break down proteins
and fats.

To start the Krebs cycle, citrate synthase combines acetyl CoA and oxaloacetate to form a six-carbon citrate molecule;
CoA is subsequently released and can combine with another pyruvate molecule to begin the cycle again. The aconitase
enzyme converts citrate into isocitrate. In two successive steps of oxidative decarboxylation, two molecules of CO2 and
two NADH molecules are produced when isocitrate dehydrogenase converts isocitrate into the five-carbon a-ketoglutarate,
which is then catalyzed and converted into the four-carbon succinyl CoA by a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.
