Like blood cells, mast cells are derived from hematopoietic stem cells and are part of the
immune system.

 Connective Tissue Fibers and Ground Substance

Three main types of fibers are secreted by fibroblasts: collagen fibers, elastic fibers, and reticular fibers. Collagen fiber is
made from fibrous protein subunits linked together to form a long and straight fiber. Collagen fibers, while flexible, have
great tensile strength, resist stretching, and give ligaments and tendons their characteristic resilience and strength. These
fibers hold connective tissues together, even during the movement of the body.

 Elastic fiber contains the protein elastin along with lesser amounts of other proteins and glycoproteins. The main
property of elastin is that after being stretched or compressed, it will return to its original shape. Elastic fibers are prominent
in elastic tissues found in skin and the elastic ligaments of the vertebral column.

 Reticular fiber is also formed from the same protein subunits as collagen fibers; however, these fibers remain narrow
and are arrayed in a branching network.
