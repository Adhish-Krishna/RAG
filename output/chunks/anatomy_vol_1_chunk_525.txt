In addition, they may refer patients to an oncologist if skin cancer that has metastasized is
suspected. Recently, cosmetic procedures have also become a prominent part of dermatology. Botox injections, laser
treatments, and collagen and dermal filler injections are popular among patients, hoping to reduce the appearance of
skin aging.

 Dermatology is a competitive specialty in medicine. Limited openings in dermatology residency programs mean
that many medical students compete for a few select spots. Dermatology is an appealing specialty to many prospective
doctors, because unlike emergency room physicians or surgeons, dermatologists generally do not have to work
excessive hours or be “on-call” weekends and holidays. Moreover, the popularity of cosmetic dermatology has made
it a growing field with many lucrative opportunities. It is not unusual for dermatology clinics to market themselves
exclusively as cosmetic dermatology centers, and for dermatologists to specialize exclusively in these procedures.
