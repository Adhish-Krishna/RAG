Each muscle is segmented by
three transverse bands of collagen fibers called the tendinous intersections. This results in the look of “six-pack abs,” as
each segment hypertrophies on individuals at the gym who do many sit-ups.

 The posterior abdominal wall is formed by the lumbar vertebrae, parts of the ilia of the hip bones, psoas major and
iliacus muscles, and quadratus lumborum muscle. This part of the core plays a key role in stabilizing the rest of the body
and maintaining posture.

Physical Therapists

Those who have a muscle or joint injury will most likely be sent to a physical therapist (PT) after seeing their regular
doctor. PTs have a master’s degree or doctorate, and are highly trained experts in the mechanics of body movements.
 Many PTs also specialize in sports injuries.

 If you injured your shoulder while you were kayaking, the first thing a physical therapist would do during your
first visit is to assess the functionality of the joint.
