CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE 481

Microglia are, as the name implies, smaller than most of the other glial cells. Ongoing research into these cells,
although not entirely conclusive, suggests that they may originate as white blood cells, called macrophages, that become
part of the CNS during early development. While their origin is not conclusively determined, their function is related to
what macrophages do in the rest of the body. When macrophages encounter diseased or damaged cells in the rest of the
body, they ingest and digest those cells or the pathogens that cause disease. Microglia are the cells in the CNS that can do
this in normal, healthy tissue, and they are therefore also referred to as CNS-resident macrophages.
