The third corner is occupied by the glenoid cavity. Posteriorly,
the spine separates the supraspinous and infraspinous fossae, and then extends laterally as the acromion. The subscapular
fossa is located on the anterior surface of the scapula. The coracoid process projects anteriorly, passing inferior to the lateral
end of the clavicle.

 8.2 Bones of the Upper Limb

Each upper limb is divided into three regions and contains a total of 30 bones. The upper arm is the region located between
the shoulder and elbow joints. This area contains the humerus. The proximal humerus consists of the head, which articulates
with the scapula at the glenohumeral joint, the greater and lesser tubercles separated by the intertubercular (bicipital) groove,
and the anatomical and surgical necks. The humeral shaft has the roughened area of the deltoid tuberosity on its lateral side.
 The distal humerus is flattened, forming a lateral supracondylar ridge that terminates at the small lateral epicondyle.
