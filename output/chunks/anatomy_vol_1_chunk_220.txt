The
most common secondary structure is a spiral called an alpha-helix. If you were to take a length of string and simply twist it
into a spiral, it would not hold the shape. Similarly, a strand of amino acids could not maintain a stable spiral shape without
the help of hydrogen bonds, which create bridges between different regions of the same strand (see Figure 2.26b). Less
commonly, a polypeptide chain can form a beta-pleated sheet, in which hydrogen bonds form bridges between different
regions of a single polypeptide that has folded back upon itself, or between two or more adjacent polypeptide chains.

 The secondary structure of proteins further folds into a compact three-dimensional shape, referred to as the proteinâ€™s
tertiary structure (see Figure 2.26c). In this configuration, amino acids that had been very distant in the primary chain can
be brought quite close via hydrogen bonds or, in proteins containing cysteine, via disulfide bonds.
