 Figure 22.29 Development of the Lower Respiratory System

Weeks 7-16

Bronchial buds continue to branch as development progresses until all of the segmental bronchi have been formed.
 Beginning around week 13, the lumens of the bronchi begin to expand in diameter. By week 16, respiratory bronchioles
form. The fetus now has all major lung structures involved in the airway.

 Weeks 16-24

Once the respiratory bronchioles form, further development includes extensive vascularization, or the development of
the blood vessels, as well as the formation of alveolar ducts and alveolar precursors.
