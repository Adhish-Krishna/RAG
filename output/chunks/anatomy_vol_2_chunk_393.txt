There are two main regions that surround the primary cortex that are usually referred to as areas V2 and V3 (the
primary visual cortex is area V1). These surrounding areas are the visual association cortex. The visual association regions
develop more complex visual perceptions by adding color and motion information. The information processed in these areas
is then sent to regions of the temporal and parietal lobes. Visual processing has two separate streams of processing: one into
the temporal lobe and one into the parietal lobe. These are the ventral and dorsal streams, respectively (Figure 14.26). The
ventral stream identifies visual stimuli and their significance. Because the ventral stream uses temporal lobe structures, it
begins to interact with the non-visual cortex and may be important in visual stimuli becoming part of memories. The dorsal
stream locates objects in space and helps in guiding movements of the body in response to visual inputs. The dorsal stream
enters the parietal lobe, where it interacts with somatosensory cortical areas that are important for our perception of the
body and its movements.
