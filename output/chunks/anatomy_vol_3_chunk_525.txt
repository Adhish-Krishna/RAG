Under conditions of stress, sympathetic
nervous activity increases, resulting in the direct vasoconstriction of afferent arterioles (norepinephrine effect) as wel
as stimulation of the adrenal medulla. The adrenal medulla, in turn, produces a generalized vasoconstriction through the
release of epinephrine. This includes vasoconstriction of the afferent arterioles, further reducing the volume of blood
flowing through the kidneys. This process redirects blood to other organs with more immediate needs. If blood pressure
falls, the sympathetic nerves will also stimulate the release of renin. Additional renin increases production of the powerful
vasoconstrictor angiotensin IJ. Angiotensin II, as discussed above, will also stimulate aldosterone production to augment

blood volume through retention of more Na‚Äù and water. Only a 10 mm Hg pressure differential across the glomerulus is
required for normal GFR, so very small changes in afferent arterial pressure significantly increase or decrease GFR.
