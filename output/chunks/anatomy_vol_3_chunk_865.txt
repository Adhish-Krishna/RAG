The prolactin-mediated synthesis of milk changes with time. Frequent milk removal by breastfeeding (or pumping)
will maintain high circulating prolactin levels for several months. However, even with continued breastfeeding, baseline
prolactin will decrease over time to its pre-pregnancy level. In addition to prolactin and oxytocin, growth hormone, cortisol,
parathyroid hormone, and insulin contribute to lactation, in part by facilitating the transport of maternal amino acids, fatty
acids, glucose, and calcium to breast milk.

 Changes in the Composition of Breast Milk

In the final weeks of pregnancy, the alveoli swell with colostrum, a thick, yellowish substance that is high in protein but
contains less fat and glucose than mature breast milk (Table 28.3). Before childbirth, some women experience leakage of
colostrum from the nipples. In contrast, mature breast milk does not leak during pregnancy and is not secreted until several
days after childbirth.
