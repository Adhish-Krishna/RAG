From the dorsal venous arch, blood supply drains into the anterior and posterior tibial veins. The
anterior tibial vein drains the area near the tibialis anterior muscle and combines with the posterior tibial vein and the
â€˜ibular vein to form the popliteal vein. The posterior tibial vein drains the posterior surface of the tibia and joins the
popliteal vein. The fibular vein drains the muscles and integument in proximity to the fibula and also joins the popliteal
vein. The small saphenous vein located on the lateral surface of the leg drains blood from the superficial regions of the
lower leg and foot, and flows into to the popliteal vein. As the popliteal vein passes behind the knee in the popliteal region,
it becomes the femoral vein. It is palpable in patients without excessive adipose tissue.

 Close to the body wall, the great saphenous vein, the deep femoral vein, and the femoral circumflex vein drain into the
emoral vein.
