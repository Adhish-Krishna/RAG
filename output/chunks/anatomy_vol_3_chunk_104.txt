In contrast, a higher, or more
basic, pH inhibits oxygen dissociation from hemoglobin. The greater the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood, the more
molecules that must be converted, which in turn generates hydrogen ions and thus lowers blood pH. Furthermore, blood
pH may become more acidic when certain byproducts of cell metabolism, such as lactic acid, carbonic acid, and carbon
dioxide, are released into the bloodstream.

 Hemoglobin of the Fetus

The fetus has its own circulation with its own erythrocytes; however, it is dependent on the mother for oxygen. Blood is
supplied to the fetus by way of the umbilical cord, which is connected to the placenta and separated from maternal blood
by the chorion. The mechanism of gas exchange at the chorion is similar to gas exchange at the respiratory membrane.
 However, the partial pressure of oxygen is lower in the maternal blood in the placenta, at about 35 to 50 mm Hg, than it is
in maternal arterial blood.
