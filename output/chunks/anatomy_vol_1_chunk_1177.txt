Figure 11.17 Muscles of the Diaphragm The diaphragm separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities.

 Defecating, urination, and even childbirth involve cooperation between the diaphragm and abdominal muscles (this
cooperation is referred to as the “Valsalva maneuver”). You hold your breath by a steady contraction of the diaphragm; this
stabilizes the volume and pressure of the peritoneal cavity. When the abdominal muscles contract, the pressure cannot push
the diaphragm up, so it increases pressure on the intestinal tract (defecation), urinary tract (urination), or reproductive tract
(childbirth).

 The inferior surface of the pericardial sac and the inferior surfaces of the pleural membranes (parietal pleura) fuse onto
the central tendon of the diaphragm. To the sides of the tendon are the skeletal muscle portions of the diaphragm, which

six ribs and their cartilages laterally, and the lumbar vertebrae and 12th ribs posteriorly.
