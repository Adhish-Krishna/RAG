Figure 8.19 Bones of the Foot The bones of the foot are divided into three groups. The posterior foot is formed by
the seven tarsal bones. The mid-foot has the five metatarsal bones. The toes contain the phalanges.

 The cuboid bone articulates with the anterior end of the calcaneus bone. The cuboid has a deep groove running across
its inferior surface, which provides passage for a muscle tendon. The talus bone articulates anteriorly with the navicular
bone, which in turn articulates anteriorly with the three cuneiform (“wedge-shaped”) bones. These bones are the medial
cuneiform, the intermediate cuneiform, and the lateral cuneiform. Each of these bones has a broad superior surface and
a narrow inferior surface, which together produce the transverse (medial-lateral) curvature of the foot.
