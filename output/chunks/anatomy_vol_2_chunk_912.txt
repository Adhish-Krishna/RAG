Until that point, physicians did not understand that death
sometimes followed blood transfusions, when the type of donor blood infused into the patient was incompatible with the
patient’s own blood. Blood groups are determined by the presence or absence of specific marker molecules on the plasma
membranes of erythrocytes. With their discovery, it became possible for the first time to match patient-donor blood types
and prevent transfusion reactions and deaths.

 Antigens, Antibodies, and Transfusion Reactions

Antigens are substances that the body does not recognize as belonging to the “self” and that therefore trigger a defensive
response from the leukocytes of the immune system. (Seek more content for additional information on immunity.) Here,
