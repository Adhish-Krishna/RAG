The ciliated epithelium of your airway forms a mucociliary escalator that sweeps particles of dust and
pathogens trapped in the secreted mucous toward the throat. It is called an escalator because it continuously pushes mucous
with trapped particles upward. In contrast, nasal cilia sweep the mucous blanket down towards your throat. In both cases,
the transported materials are usually swallowed, and end up in the acidic environment of your stomach.

 Cell to Cell Junctions

Cells of epithelia are closely connected and are not separated by intracellular material. Three basic types of connections
allow varying degrees of interaction between the cells: tight junctions, anchoring junctions, and gap junctions (Figure 4.5).
