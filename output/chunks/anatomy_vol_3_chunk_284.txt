 Carbohydrate Digestion

The average American diet is about 50 percent carbohydrates, which may be classified according to the number of
monomers they contain of simple sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides) and/or complex sugars (polysaccharides).
 Glucose, galactose, and fructose are the three monosaccharides that are commonly consumed and are readily absorbed. Your
digestive system is also able to break down the disaccharide sucrose (regular table sugar: glucose + fructose), lactose (milk
sugar: glucose + galactose), and maltose (grain sugar: glucose + glucose), and the polysaccharides glycogen and starch
(chains of monosaccharides).
