The relationship
of these two types of glial cells to ganglia and nerves in the PNS is seen in Figure 12.12.

 Myelin

The insulation for axons in the nervous system is provided by glial cells, oligodendrocytes in the CNS, and Schwann cells
in the PNS. Whereas the manner in which either cell is associated with the axon segment, or segments, that it insulates is
different, the means of myelinating an axon segment is mostly the same in the two situations. Myelin is a lipid-rich sheath
that surrounds the axon and by doing so creates a myelin sheath that facilitates the transmission of electrical signals along
the axon. The lipids are essentially the phospholipids of the glial cell membrane. Myelin, however, is more than just the
membrane of the glial cell.
