You obtain these elements from the foods you eat and the air you breathe. The smallest unit of an element that
retains all of the properties of that element is an atom. But, atoms themselves contain many subatomic particles, the three
most important of which are protons, neutrons, and electrons. These particles do not vary in quality from one element to
another; rather, what gives an element its distinctive identification is the quantity of its protons, called its atomic number.
 Protons and neutrons contribute nearly all of an atom’s mass; the number of protons and neutrons is an element’s mass
number. Heavier and lighter versions of the same element can occur in nature because these versions have different numbers
of neutrons. Different versions of an element are called isotopes.

 The tendency of an atom to be stable or to react readily with other atoms is largely due to the behavior of the electrons
within the atom’s outermost electron shell, called its valence shell.
