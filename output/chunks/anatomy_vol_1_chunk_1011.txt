Ca** also is required for the contraction of smooth muscle, although its role is different: here Ca**
activates enzymes, which in turn activate myosin heads. All muscles require adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to continue the

process of contracting, and they all relax when the Ca’* is removed and the actin-binding sites are re-shielded.

CHAPTER 10| MUSCLE TISSUE 379

A muscle can return to its original length when relaxed due to a quality of muscle tissue called elasticity. It can recoil
back to its original length due to elastic fibers. Muscle tissue also has the quality of extensibility; it can stretch or extend.
 Contractility allows muscle tissue to pull on its attachment points and shorten with force.

 Differences among the three muscle types include the microscopic organization of their contractile proteins—actin and
myosin. The actin and myosin proteins are arranged very regularly in the cytoplasm of individual muscle cells (referred
to as fibers) in both skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, which creates a pattern, or stripes, called striations.
