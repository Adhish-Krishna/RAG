Figure 24.18 Urea Cycle Nitrogen is transaminated, creating ammonia and intermediates of the Krebs cycle.
 Ammonia is processed in the urea cycle to produce urea that is eliminated through the kidneys.

 Amino acids can also be used as a source of energy, especially in times of starvation. Because the processing of amino
acids results in the creation of metabolic intermediates, including pyruvate, acetyl CoA, acetoacyl CoA, oxaloacetate, and
a-ketoglutarate, amino acids can serve as a source of energy production through the Krebs cycle (Figure 24.19). Figure
24.20 summarizes the pathways of catabolism and anabolism for carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins.
