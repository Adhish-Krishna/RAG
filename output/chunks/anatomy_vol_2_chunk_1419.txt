This is one explanation for the rising incidence of allergies in developed countries, where the response to nonpathogens
like pollen, shrimp, and cat dander cause allergic responses while not serving any protective function.

CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 953

The Mucosal Immune Response

Mucosal tissues are major barriers to the entry of pathogens into the body. The IgA (and sometimes IgM) antibodies in
mucus and other secretions can bind to the pathogen, and in the cases of many viruses and bacteria, neutralize them.
 Neutralization is the process of coating a pathogen with antibodies, making it physically impossible for the pathogen to
bind to receptors. Neutralization, which occurs in the blood, lymph, and other body fluids and secretions, protects the body
constantly. Neutralizing antibodies are the basis for the disease protection offered by vaccines. Vaccinations for diseases
that commonly enter the body via mucous membranes, such as influenza, are usually formulated to enhance IgA production.
