However, the term clonal selection is not a complete
description of the theory, as clonal expansion goes hand in glove with the selection process. The main tenet of the theory
is that a typical individual has a multitude (1014) of different types of T cell clones based on their receptors. In this use, a
clone is a group of lymphocytes that share the same antigen receptor. Each clone is necessarily present in the body in low
numbers. Otherwise, the body would not have room for lymphocytes with so many specificities.

 Only those clones of lymphocytes whose receptors are activated by the antigen are stimulated to proliferate. Keep in
mind that most antigens have multiple antigenic determinants, so a T cell response to a typical antigen involves a polyclonal
response. A polyclonal response is the stimulation of multiple T cell clones. Once activated, the selected clones increase in
number and make many copies of each cell type, each clone with its unique receptor.
