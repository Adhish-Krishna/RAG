Resistance training is especially important to slow down the eventual
bone loss due to aging and for preventing osteoporosis.

 Nutrition and Bone Tissue

The vitamins and minerals contained in all of the food we consume are important for all of our organ systems. However,
there are certain nutrients that affect bone health.

 Calcium and Vitamin D

You already know that calcium is a critical component of bone, especially in the form of calcium phosphate and calcium
carbonate. Since the body cannot make calcium, it must be obtained from the diet. However, calcium cannot be absorbed
from the small intestine without vitamin D. Therefore, intake of vitamin D is also critical to bone health. In addition to
vitamin Dâ€™s role in calcium absorption, it also plays a role, though not as clearly understood, in bone remodeling.

 Milk and other dairy foods are not the only sources of calcium. This important nutrient is also found in green leafy
vegetables, broccoli, and intact salmon and canned sardines with their soft bones.
