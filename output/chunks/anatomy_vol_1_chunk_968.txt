Movements at the subtalar joint, between the talus and calcaneus bones, combined with motions
at other intertarsal joints, enables eversion/inversion movements of the foot. Ligaments that unite the medial or lateral
malleolus with the talus and calcaneus bones serve to support the talocrural joint and to resist excess eversion or
inversion of the foot.

The ankle is the most frequently injured joint in the body, with the most common injury being an inversion ankle sprain.
 A sprain is the stretching or tearing of the supporting ligaments. Excess inversion causes the talus bone to tilt laterally,
thus damaging the ligaments on the lateral side of the ankle.
