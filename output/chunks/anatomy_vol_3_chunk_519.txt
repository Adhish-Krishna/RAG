The movement of Na” out of the lumen

of the collecting duct creates a negative charge that promotes the movement of Cl” out of the lumen into the interstitial
space by a paracellular route across tight junctions. Peritubular capillaries receive the solutes and water, returning them to
the circulation.

 Cells of the DCT also recover Ca** from the filtrate. Receptors for parathyroid hormone (PTH) are found in DCT cells
and when bound to PTH, induce the insertion of calcium channels on their luminal surface. The channels enhance Ca**
recovery from the forming urine. In addition, as Na* is pumped out of the cell, the resulting electrochemical gradient attracts
Ca** into the cell. Finally, calcitriol (1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, the active form of vitamin D) is very important for calcium

recovery. It induces the production of calcium-binding proteins that transport Ca** into the cell. These binding proteins
are also important for the movement of calcium inside the cell and aid in exocytosis of calcium across the basolateral

membrane.
