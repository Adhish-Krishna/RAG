* The least abundant plasma protein is fibrinogen. Like albumin and the alpha and beta globulins, fibrinogen is
produced by the liver. It is essential for blood clotting, a process described later in this chapter. Fibrinogen accounts

for about 7 percent of the total plasma protein volume, in clinica

Other Plasma Solutes

levels of 0.2-0.45 g/dL blood.

 In addition to proteins, plasma contains a wide variety of other substances. These include various electrolytes, such as
sodium, potassium, and calcium ions; dissolved gases, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen; various organic
nutrients, such as vitamins, lipids, glucose, and amino acids; and metabolic wastes. All of these nonprotein solutes combined

contribute approximately 1 percent to the total volume of plasma.
