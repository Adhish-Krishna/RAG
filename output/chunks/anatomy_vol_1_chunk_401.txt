Stratified cuboidal epithelium and
stratified columnar epithelium can also be found in certain glands and ducts, but are uncommon in the human body.

 Another kind of stratified epithelium is transitional epithelium, so-called because of the gradual changes in the shapes
of the apical cells as the bladder fills with urine. It is found only in the urinary system, specifically the ureters and urinary
bladder. When the bladder is empty, this epithelium is convoluted and has cuboidal apical cells with convex, umbrella
shaped, apical surfaces. As the bladder fills with urine, this epithelium loses its convolutions and the apical cells transition
from cuboidal to squamous. It appears thicker and more multi-layered when the bladder is empty, and more stretched out
and less stratified when the bladder is full and distended. Figure 4.8 summarizes the different categories of epithelial cell
tissue cells.
