As contraction starts, it is used up in
seconds. More ATP is generated from creatine phosphate for about 15 seconds. (b) Each glucose molecule produces

two ATP and two molecules of pyruvic acid, which can be used in

aerobic respiration or converted to lactic acid. If

oxygen is not available, pyruvic acid is converted to lactic acid, which may contribute to muscle fatigue. This occurs
during strenuous exercise when high amounts of energy are needed but oxygen cannot be sufficiently delivered to
muscle. (c) Aerobic respiration is the breakdown of glucose in the presence of oxygen (O2) to produce carbon dioxide,
water, and ATP. Approximately 95 percent of the ATP required for resting or moderately active muscles is provided by

aerobic respiration, which takes place in mitochondria.

 As the ATP produced by creatine phosphate is depleted, muscles turn to glycolysis as an ATP source. Glycolysis is an
anaerobic (non-oxygen-dependent) process that breaks down glucose (sugar) to produce ATP; however, glycolysis cannot
generate ATP as quickly as creatine phosphate.
