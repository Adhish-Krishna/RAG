Here, the extent of
movement is the point of the test. The examiner is watching for conjugate movements representing proper function of the
related nuclei and the MLF. Failure of one eye to abduct while the other adducts in a horizontal movement is referred to
as internuclear ophthalmoplegia. When this occurs, the patient will experience diplopia, or double vision, as the two
eyes are temporarily pointed at different stimuli. Diplopia is not restricted to failure of the lateral rectus, because any of the
extraocular muscles may fail to move one eye in perfect conjugation with the other.

 The final aspect of testing eye movements is to move the tip of the pen in toward the patientâ€™s face. As visual stimuli
move closer to the face, the two medial recti muscles cause the eyes to move in the one nonconjugate movement that is part
of gaze control.
