At the
same time that aldosterone causes increased recovery of Na’, it also causes greater loss of K*. Progesterone is a steroid
that is structurally similar to aldosterone. It binds to the aldosterone receptor and weakly stimulates Na’ reabsorption and

increased water recovery. This process is unimportant in men due to low levels of circulating progesterone. It may cause
increased retention of water during some periods of the menstrual cycle in women when progesterone levels increase.

 Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH)

Diuretics are drugs that can increase water loss by interfering with the recapture of solutes and water from the forming
urine. They are often prescribed to lower blood pressure. Coffee, tea, and alcoholic beverages are familiar diuretics. ADH,
a 9-amino acid peptide released by the posterior pituitary, works to do the exact opposite. It promotes the recovery of water,
decreases urine volume, and maintains plasma osmolarity and blood pressure.
