The patient would be asked in what direction the stimulus is moving. All of these tests are
repeated in distal and proximal locations and for different dermatomes to assess the spatial specificity of perception. The
sense of position and motion, proprioception, is tested by moving the fingers or toes and asking the patient if they sense the
movement. If the distal locations are not perceived, the test is repeated at increasingly proximal joints.

 The various stimuli used to test sensory input assess the function of the major ascending tracts of the spinal cord.
 The dorsal column pathway conveys fine touch, vibration, and proprioceptive information, whereas the spinothalamic
pathway primarily conveys pain and temperature. Testing these stimuli provides information about whether these two major
ascending pathways are functioning properly. Within the spinal cord, the two systems are segregated. The dorsal column
information ascends ipsilateral to the source of the stimulus and decussates in the medulla, whereas the spinothalamic
pathway decussates at the level of entry and ascends contralaterally.
