The ligaments are the iliofemoral ligament, pubofemoral
ligament, and ischiofemoral ligament, all of which spiral around the head and neck of the femur. The ligaments are
tightened by extension at the hip, thus pulling the head of the femur tightly into the acetabulum when in the upright,
standing position. Very little additional extension of the thigh is permitted beyond this vertical position. These ligaments
thus stabilize the hip joint and allow you to maintain an upright standing position with only minimal muscle contraction.
 Inside of the articular capsule, the ligament of the head of the femur (ligamentum teres) spans between the acetabulum
and femoral head. This intracapsular ligament is normally slack and does not provide any significant joint support, but it
does provide a pathway for an important artery that supplies the head of the femur.

 The hip is prone to osteoarthritis, and thus was the first joint for which a replacement prosthesis was developed.
