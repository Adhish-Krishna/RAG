For example, the sight, smell, and taste of food
initiate long reflexes that begin with a sensory neuron delivering a signal to the medulla oblongata. The response to the
signal is to stimulate cells in the stomach to begin secreting digestive juices in preparation for incoming food. In contrast,
food that distends the stomach initiates short reflexes that cause cells in the stomach wall to increase their secretion of
digestive juices.

CHAPTER 23| THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 1031

Hormonal Controls

A variety of hormones are involved in the digestive process. The main digestive hormone of the stomach is gastrin, which
is secreted in response to the presence of food. Gastrin stimulates the secretion of gastric acid by the parietal cells of the
stomach mucosa. Other GI hormones are produced and act upon the gut and its accessory organs. Hormones produced by
the duodenum include secretin, which stimulates a watery secretion of bicarbonate by the pancreas; cholecystokinin (CCK),
which stimulates the secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile from the liver and release of bile from the gallbladder; and
gastric inhibitory peptide, which inhibits gastric secretion and slows gastric emptying and motility.
