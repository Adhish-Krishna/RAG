The most common treatment is defibrillation, which uses special paddles to apply a charge to the heart
from an external electrical source in an attempt to establish a normal sinus rhythm (Figure 19.26). A defibrillator
effectively stops the heart so that the SA node can trigger a normal conduction cycle. Because of their effectiveness
in reestablishing a normal sinus rhythm, external automated defibrillators (EADs) are being placed in areas frequented
by large numbers of people, such as schools, restaurants, and airports. These devices contain simple and direct verbal
instructions that can be followed by nonmedical personnel in an attempt to save a life.

A heart block refers to an interruption in the normal conduction pathway.
