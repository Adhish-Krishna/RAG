This strategy is in stark contrast to the approach used by the adaptive immune system, which uses
large numbers of different receptors, each highly specific to a particular pathogen.

 Should the cells of the innate immune system come into contact with a species of pathogen they recognize, the cell
will bind to the pathogen and initiate phagocytosis (or cellular apoptosis in the case of an intracellular pathogen) in an effort
to destroy the offending microbe. Receptors vary somewhat according to cell type, but they usually include receptors for
bacterial components and for complement, discussed below.

 Soluble Mediators of the Innate Immune Response

The previous discussions have alluded to chemical signals that can induce cells to change various physiological
characteristics, such as the expression of a particular receptor. These soluble factors are secreted during innate or early
induced responses, and later during adaptive immune responses.

 Cytokines and Chemokines

A cytokine is signaling molecule that allows cells to communicate with each other over short distances.
