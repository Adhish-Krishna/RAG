37 Tendons of the infraspinatus, supraspinatus, teres minor, and the subscapularis form the
rotator cuff, which forms a foundation on which the arms and shoulders can be stabilized and move. 38 The muscles that make up
the shoulders and upper limbs include the muscles that position the pelvic girdle, the muscles that move the humerus, the muscles
that move the forearm, and the muscles that move the wrists, hands, and fingers. 39 The biceps femoris, semimembranosus, and
semitendinosus form the hamstrings. The hamstrings flex the leg at the knee joint. 40 The rectus femoris, vastus medialis, vastus
lateralis, and vastus intermedius form the quadriceps. The quadriceps muscles extend the leg at the knee joint.

be seen clearly in these images.
