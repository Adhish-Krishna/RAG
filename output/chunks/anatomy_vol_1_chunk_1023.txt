(c) Can you give an
example of each? (d) Why is the neurotransmitter acetylcholine degraded after binding to its receptor?

Excitation-Contraction Coupling

All living cells have membrane potentials, or electrical gradients across their membranes. The inside of the membrane
is usually around -60 to -90 mV, relative to the outside. This is referred to as a cellâ€™s membrane potential. Neurons and
muscle cells can use their membrane potentials to generate electrical signals. They do this by controlling the movement of
charged particles, called ions, across their membranes to create electrical currents. This is achieved by opening and closing

specialized proteins in the membrane called ion channels. Although the currents generated by ions moving through these
channel proteins are very small, they form the basis of both neural signaling and muscle contraction.
