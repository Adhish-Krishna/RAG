Their ability to hold
this much blood is due to their high capacitance, that is, their capacity to distend (expand) readily to store a high volume
of blood, even at a low pressure. The large lumens and relatively thin walls of veins make them far more distensible than
arteries; thus, they are said to be capacitance vessels.

Figure 20.9 Distribution of Blood Flow

When blood flow needs to be redistributed to other portions of the body, the vasomotor center located in the medulla
oblongata sends sympathetic stimulation to the smooth muscles in the walls of the veins, causing constrictionâ€”or in this
case, venoconstriction.
