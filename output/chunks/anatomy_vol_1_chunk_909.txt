Ball-and-Socket Joint

The joint with the greatest range of motion is the ball-and-socket joint. At these joints, the rounded head of one bone
(the ball) fits into the concave articulation (the socket) of the adjacent bone (see Figure 9.10f). The hip joint and the
glenohumeral (shoulder) joint are the only ball-and-socket joints of the body. At the hip joint, the head of the femur
articulates with the acetabulum of the hip bone, and at the shoulder joint, the head of the humerus articulates with the
glenoid cavity of the scapula.

 Ball-and-socket joints are classified functionally as multiaxial joints. The femur and the humerus are able to move
in both anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions and they can also rotate around their long axis. The shallow socket
formed by the glenoid cavity allows the shoulder joint an extensive range of motion.
