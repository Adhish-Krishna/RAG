The cross-bridges can only form where thin and thick filaments already overlap, so that the length
of the sarcomere has a direct influence on the force generated when the sarcomere shortens. This is called the length-tension
relationship.

 The ideal length of a sarcomere to produce maximal tension occurs at 80 percent to 120 percent of its resting length,
with 100 percent being the state where the medial edges of the thin filaments are just at the most-medial myosin heads of the
thick filaments (Figure 10.14). This length maximizes the overlap of actin-binding sites and myosin heads. If a sarcomere
is stretched past this ideal length (beyond 120 percent), thick and thin filaments do not overlap sufficiently, which results in
less tension produced. If a sarcomere is shortened beyond 80 percent, the zone of overlap is reduced with the thin filaments
jutting beyond the last of the myosin heads and shrinks the H zone, which is normally composed of myosin tails.
