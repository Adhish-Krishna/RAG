19.3 Cardiac Cycle

The cardiac cycle comprises a complete relaxation and contraction of both the atria and ventricles, and lasts approximately
0.8 seconds. Beginning with all chambers in diastole, blood flows passively from the veins into the atria and past the
atrioventricular valves into the ventricles. The atria begin to contract (atrial systole), following depolarization of the atria,
and pump blood into the ventricles. The ventricles begin to contract (ventricular systole), raising pressure within the
ventricles. When ventricular pressure rises above the pressure in the atria, blood flows toward the atria, producing the first
heart sound, S or lub. As pressure in the ventricles rises above two major arteries, blood pushes open the two semilunar
valves and moves into the pulmonary trunk and aorta in the ventricular ejection phase. Following ventricular repolarization,
the ventricles begin to relax (ventricular diastole), and pressure within the ventricles drops. As ventricular pressure drops,
there is a tendency for blood to flow back into the atria from the major arteries, producing the dicrotic notch in the ECG and
closing the two semilunar valves.
