The manubrium is joined to the body of the sternum at the sternal angle,
which is also the site for attachment of the second rib costal cartilages. The body receives the costal cartilage attachments for ribs
3-7. The small xiphoid process forms the inferior tip of the sternum. 40 A typical rib is a flattened, curved bone. The head o.
rib is attached posteriorly to the costal facets of the thoracic vertebrae. The rib tubercle articulates with the transverse process 0:
horacic vertebra. The angle is the area of greatest rib curvature and forms the largest portion of the thoracic cage. The body (sha
of a rib extends anteriorly and terminates at the attachment to its costal cartilage. The shallow costal groove runs along the inferi
margin of a rib and carries blood vessels and a nerve. 41 Ribs are classified based on if and how their costal cartilages attach
the sternum. True (vertebrosternal) ribs are ribs 1-7. The costal cartilage for each of these attaches directly to the sternum.
