If that graded potential is strong enough to reach threshold, the second neuron generates
an action potential at its axon hillock. The target of this neuron is another neuron in the thalamus of the brain, the part
of the CNS that acts as a relay for sensory information. At another synapse, neurotransmitter is released and binds to its
receptor. The thalamus then sends the sensory information to the cerebral cortex, the outermost layer of gray matter in the
brain, where conscious perception of that water temperature begins.

 Within the cerebral cortex, information is processed among many neurons, integrating the stimulus of the water
temperature with other sensory stimuli, with your emotional state (you just aren't ready to wake up; the bed is calling to
you), memories (perhaps of the lab notes you have to study before a quiz).
