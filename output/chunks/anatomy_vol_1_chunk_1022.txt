The Sarcomere The sarcomere, the region from one Z-line to the next Z-line, is the functional unit of a
skeletal muscle fiber.

 The Neuromuscular Junction

Another specialization of the skeletal muscle is the site where a motor neuron’s terminal meets the muscle fiber—called
the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). This is where the muscle fiber first responds to signaling by the motor neuron. Every
skeletal muscle fiber in every skeletal muscle is innervated by a motor neuron at the NMJ. Excitation signals from the
neuron are the only way to functionally activate the fiber to contract.

Every skeletal muscle fiber is supplied by a motor neuron at the NMJ. Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/
\/skelmuscfiber) to learn more about what happens at the NMJ. (a) What is the definition of a motor unit? (b) What
is the structural and functional difference between a large motor unit and a small motor unit?
