In addition

to lipid synthesis, the smooth ER also sequesters (i.e., stores) and regulates the concentration of cellular Ca**, a function

extremely important in cells of the nervous system where Ca”” is the trigger for neurotransmitter release. The smooth ER
additionally metabolizes some carbohydrates and performs a detoxification role, breaking down certain toxins.

 In contrast with the smooth ER, the primary job of the rough ER is the synthesis and modification of proteins destined
for the cell membrane or for export from the cell. For this protein synthesis, many ribosomes attach to the ER (giving it the
studded appearance of rough ER). Typically, a protein is synthesized within the ribosome and released inside the channel of
the rough ER, where sugars can be added to it (by a process called glycosylation) before it is transported within a vesicle to
the next stage in the packaging and shipping process: the Golgi apparatus.
