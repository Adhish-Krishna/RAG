Some cases of fluid in excess of one liter within the pericardial cavity have been reported. Rapid
accumulation of as little as 100 mL of fluid following trauma may trigger cardiac tamponade. Other common causes
include myocardial rupture, pericarditis, cancer, or even cardiac surgery. Removal of this excess fluid requires insertion
of drainage tubes into the pericardial cavity. Premature removal of these drainage tubes, for example, following cardiac
surgery, or clot formation within these tubes are causes of this condition. Untreated, cardiac tamponade can lead to
death.

 Surface Features of the Heart

Inside the pericardium, the surface features of the heart are visible, including the four chambers. There is a superficial leaf-
like extension of the atria near the superior surface of the heart, one on each side, called an auricle—a name that means “ear
like”—because its shape resembles the external ear of a human (Figure 19.6).
