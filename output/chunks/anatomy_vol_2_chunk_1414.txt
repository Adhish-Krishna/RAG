To become fully activated, the B cell must receive two signals from the native antigen and the T cell's
cytokines.

21.5 | The Immune Response against Pathogens

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 ¢ Explain the development of immunological competence
¢ Describe the mucosal immune response
¢ Discuss immune responses against bacterial, viral, fungal, and animal pathogens

* Describe different ways pathogens evade immune responses

Now that you understand the development of mature, naive B cells and T cells, and some of their major functions, how do all
of these various cells, proteins, and cytokines come together to actually resolve an infection?
