The device is also so noisy that, even with earplugs, patients can become
anxious or even fearful. These problems have been overcome somewhat with the development of “open” MRI scanning,
which does not require the patient to be entirely enclosed in the metal tube. Patients with iron-containing metallic implants
(internal sutures, some prosthetic devices, and so on) cannot undergo MRI scanning because it can dislodge these implants.
 Functional MRIs (f{MRIs), which detect the concentration of blood flow in certain parts of the body, are increasingly
being used to study the activity in parts of the brain during various body activities. This has helped scientists learn more
about the locations of different brain functions and more about brain abnormalities and diseases.

Positron Emission Tomography

Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique involving the use of so-called radiopharmaceuticals,
substances that emit radiation that is short-lived and therefore relatively safe to administer to the body.
