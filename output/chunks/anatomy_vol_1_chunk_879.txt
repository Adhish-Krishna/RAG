Each disc allows for limited movement between the vertebrae and thus functionally forms an amphiarthrosis
type of joint. Intervertebral discs are made of fibrocartilage and thereby structurally form a symphysis type of
cartilaginous joint.

 Diarthrosis

A freely mobile joint is classified as a diarthrosis. These types of joints include all synovial joints of the body, which
provide the majority of body movements. Most diarthrotic joints are found in the appendicular skeleton and thus give the
limbs a wide range of motion. These joints are divided into three categories, based on the number of axes of motion provided
by each. An axis in anatomy is described as the movements in reference to the three anatomical planes: transverse, frontal,

and sagittal. Thus, diarthroses are classified as uniaxial (for movement in one plane), biaxial (for movement in two planes),
or multiaxial joints (for movement in all three anatomical planes).
