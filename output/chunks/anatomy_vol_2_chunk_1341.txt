The micrograph of the lymph nodes shows a germinal center, which consists of rapidly
dividing B cells surrounded by a layer of T cells and other accessory cells. LM x 128. (Micrograph provided by the

 The major routes into the lymph node are via afferent lymphatic vessels (see Figure 21.8). Cells and lymph fluid that
leave the lymph node may do so by another set of vessels known as the efferent lymphatic vessels. Lymph enters the lymph
node via the subcapsular sinus, which is occupied by dendritic cells, macrophages, and reticular fibers. Within the cortex of
the lymph node are lymphoid follicles, which consist of germinal centers of rapidly dividing B cells surrounded by a layer
of T cells and other accessory cells.
