Natriuretic hormones, released primarily from the atria of the heart in response to stretching of the atrial walls, stimulate

Na’ excretion and thereby decrease blood pressure. PTH stimulates the final step in the formation of active vitamin D3 and

reduces phosphate reabsorption, resulting in higher circulating Ca** levels.
 25.9 Regulation of Fluid Volume and Composition

The major hormones regulating body fluids are ADH, aldosterone and ANH. Progesterone is similar in structure to
aldosterone and can bind to and weakly stimulate aldosterone receptors, providing a similar but diminished response. Blood
pressure is a reflection of blood volume and is monitored by baroreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinuses. When
blood pressure increases, more action potentials are sent to the central nervous system, resulting in greater vasodilation,
greater GFR, and more water lost in the urine. ANH is released by the cardiomyocytes when blood pressure increases,

causing Na” and water loss. ADH at high levels causes vasoconstriction in addition to its action on the collecting ducts to
recover more water.
