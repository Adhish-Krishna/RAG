ECG Abnormalities

Occassionally, an area of the heart other than the SA node will initiate an impulse that will be followed by a premature
contraction. Such an area, which may actually be a component of the conduction system or some other contractile
cells, is known as an ectopic focus or ectopic pacemaker. An ectopic focus may be stimulated by localized ischemia;
exposure to certain drugs, including caffeine, digitalis, or acetylcholine; elevated stimulation by both sympathetic
or parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system; or a number of disease or pathological conditions.
