HCl in the stomach aids in proteolysis, and hormones secreted by intestinal cells direct the digestive
processes.

 In order to avoid breaking down the proteins that make up the pancreas and small intestine, pancreatic enzymes are
released as inactive proenzymes that are only activated in the small intestine. In the pancreas, vesicles store trypsin and
chymotrypsin as trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen. Once released into the small intestine, an enzyme found in the wal.
of the small intestine, called enterokinase, binds to trypsinogen and converts it into its active form, trypsin. Trypsin then
binds to chymotrypsinogen to convert it into the active chymotrypsin. Trypsin and chymotrypsin break down large proteins
into smaller peptides, a process called proteolysis. These smaller peptides are catabolized into their constituent amino acids,
which are transported across the apical surface of the intestinal mucosa in a process that is mediated by sodium-amino acid
transporters.
