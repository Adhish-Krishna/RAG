Many fractures result from a hard fall onto an outstretched hand. The resulting
transmission of force up the limb may result in a fracture of the humerus, radius, or scaphoid bones. These injuries are
especially common in elderly people whose bones are weakened due to osteoporosis.

 Falls onto the hand or elbow, or direct blows to the arm, can result in fractures of the humerus (Figure 8.11).
 Following a fall, fractures at the surgical neck, the region at which the expanded proximal end of the humerus joins
with the shaft, can result in an impacted fracture, in which the distal portion of the humerus is driven into the proximal
portion. Falls or blows to the arm can also produce transverse or spiral fractures of the humeral shaft.

 In children, a fall onto the tip of the elbow frequently results in a distal humerus fracture. In these, the olecranon
of the ulna is driven upward, resulting in a fracture across the distal humerus, above both epicondyles (supracondylar
fracture), or a fracture between the epicondyles, thus separating one or both of the epicondyles from the body of the
humerus (intercondylar fracture).
