By the twelfth week, a primary ossification center will have appeared in the diaphysis (shaft) region of the long
bones, initiating the process that converts the cartilage model into bone. A secondary ossification center will appear in each
epiphysis (expanded end) of these bones at a later time, usually after birth. The primary and secondary ossification centers
are separated by the epiphyseal plate, a layer of growing hyaline cartilage. This plate is located between the diaphysis and
each epiphysis. It continues to grow and is responsible for the lengthening of the bone. The epiphyseal plate is retained for
many years, until the bone reaches its final, adult size, at which time the epiphyseal plate disappears and the epiphysis fuses
to the diaphysis. (Seek additional content on ossification in the chapter on bone tissue.)
 Small bones, such as the phalanges, will develop only one secondary ossification center and will thus have only a single
epiphyseal plate.
