Digestive System: From Appetite Suppression to Constipation

Age-related changes in the digestive system begin in the mouth and can affect virtually every aspect of the digestive
system. Taste buds become less sensitive, so food isn’t as appetizing as it once was. A slice of pizza is a challenge,
not a treat, when you have lost teeth, your gums are diseased, and your salivary glands aren’t producing enough saliva.
 Swallowing can be difficult, and ingested food moves slowly through the alimentary canal because of reduced strength
and tone of muscular tissue. Neurosensory feedback is also dampened, slowing the transmission of messages that
stimulate the release of enzymes and hormones.

 Pathologies that affect the digestive organs—such as hiatal hernia, gastritis, and peptic ulcer disease—can occur
at greater frequencies as you age. Problems in the small intestine may include duodenal ulcers, maldigestion, and
malabsorption. Problems in the large intestine include hemorrhoids, diverticular disease, and constipation.
