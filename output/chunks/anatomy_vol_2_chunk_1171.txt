Atherosclerosis can result from plaques formed by the buildup of fatty, calcified
deposits in an artery. (b) Plaques can also take other forms, as shown in this micrograph of a coronary artery
that has a buildup of connective tissue within the artery wall. LM x 40. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of

Sometimes a plaque can rupture, causing microscopic tears in the artery wall that allow blood to leak into the
tissue on the other side. When this happens, platelets rush to the site to clot the blood. This clot can further obstruct the
artery and—if it occurs in a coronary or cerebral artery—cause a sudden heart attack or stroke. Alternatively, plaque
can break off and travel through the bloodstream as an embolus until it blocks a more distant, smaller artery.

 Even without total blockage, vessel narrowing leads to ischemia—reduced blood flow—to the tissue region
“downstream” of the narrowed vessel.
