This causes more hydrogen ions to be produced, causing the blood pH to drop. When the body is resting, oxygen levels
are higher, carbon dioxide levels are lower, more hydrogen is bound, and pH rises. (Seek additional content for more detail
about pH.)
The chemoreceptors respond to increasing carbon dioxide and hydrogen ion levels (falling pH) by stimulating the
cardioaccelerator and vasomotor centers, increasing cardiac output and constricting peripheral vessels. The cardioinhibitor
centers are suppressed. With falling carbon dioxide and hydrogen ion levels (increasing pH), the cardioinhibitor centers
are stimulated, and the cardioaccelerator and vasomotor centers are suppressed, decreasing cardiac output and causing
peripheral vasodilation. In order to maintain adequate supplies of oxygen to the cells and remove waste products such as
carbon dioxide, it is essential that the respiratory system respond to changing metabolic demands. In turn, the cardiovascular
system will transport these gases to the lungs for exchange, again in accordance with metabolic demands.
