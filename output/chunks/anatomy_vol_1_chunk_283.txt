The CFTR requires ATP in order to function, making its Cl transport a form of active transport. This

characteristic puzzled researchers for a long time because the Cl ions are actually flowing down their concentration
gradient when transported out of cells. Active transport generally pumps ions against their concentration gradient, but
the CFTR presents an exception to this rule.

 In normal lung tissue, the movement of Cl‚Äù out of the cell maintains a Cl -rich, negatively charged environment
immediately outside of the cell. This is particularly important in the epithelial lining of the respiratory system.
 Respiratory epithelial cells secrete mucus, which serves to trap dust, bacteria, and other debris. A cilium (plural = cilia)
is one of the hair-like appendages found on certain cells. Cilia on the epithelial cells move the mucus and its trapped
particles up the airways away from the lungs and toward the outside. In order to be effectively moved upward, the

mucus cannot be too viscous; rather it must have a thin, watery consistency.
