Furthermore, when descending inputs from the hypothalamus stimulate this area, the sympathetic system can increase
activity in the cardiovascular system, such as in response to anxiety or stress. The preganglionic sympathetic fibers that
are responsible for increasing heart rate are referred to as the cardiac accelerator nerves, whereas the preganglionic
sympathetic fibers responsible for constricting blood vessels compose the vasomotor nerves.

 Several brain stem nuclei are important for the visceral control of major organ systems. One brain stem nucleus
involved in cardiovascular function is the solitary nucleus. It receives sensory input about blood pressure and cardiac
function from the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves, and its output will activate sympathetic stimulation of the heart or
blood vessels through the upper thoracic lateral horn. Another brain stem nucleus important for visceral control is the dorsal
motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, which is the motor nucleus for the parasympathetic functions ascribed to the vagus
nerve, including decreasing the heart rate, relaxing bronchial tubes in the lungs, and activating digestive function through
the enteric nervous system.
