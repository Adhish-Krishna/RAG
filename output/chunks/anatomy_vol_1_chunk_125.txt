In other words, an atom
of hydrogen is a unit of hydrogen—the smallest amount of hydrogen that can exist. As you might guess, atoms are almost
unfathomably small. The period at the end of this sentence is millions of atoms wide.

 Atomic Structure and Energy

Atoms are made up of even smaller subatomic particles, three types of which are important: the proton, neutron, and
electron. The number of positively-charged protons and non-charged (“neutral”) neutrons, gives mass to the atom, and the
number of each in the nucleus of the atom determine the element. The number of negatively-charged electrons that “spin”
around the nucleus at close to the speed of light equals the number of protons. An electron has about 1/2000th the mass of
a proton or neutron.

 Figure 2.3 shows two models that can help you imagine the structure of an atom—in this case, helium (He).
