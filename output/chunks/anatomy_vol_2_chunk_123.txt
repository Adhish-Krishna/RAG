A stimulus of longer

durations causes a longer
lasting depolarization, but
not of any greater strength
than the previous stimulus

Threshold Alarger stimulus that
depolarizes above the
threshold may trigger
an action potential in a

postsynaptic neuron

Some stimuli result
in hyperpolarization,
which depends on
the specific ion
channels activated
in the cell membrane

Figure 12.25 Graded Potentials Graded potentials are temporary changes in the membrane voltage, the
characteristics of which depend on the size of the stimulus.
