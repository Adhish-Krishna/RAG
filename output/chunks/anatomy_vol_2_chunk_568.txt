He compared the size, shape, and number

pose the primary somatosensory cortex. Within this area, finer separation can be made on the basis of the

concept of the sensory homunculus, as well as the different submodalities of somatosensation such as touch, vibration, pain,

temperature,

or proprioception. Today, we more frequently refer to these regions by their function (i.e., primary sensory

cortex) than

by the number Brodmann assigned to them, but in some situations the use of Brodmann numbers persists.
