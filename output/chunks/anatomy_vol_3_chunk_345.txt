Aldolase then breaks down this fructose-1-6-bisphosphate into
two three-carbon molecules, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The triosephosphate isomerase
enzyme then converts dihydroxyacetone phosphate into a second glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate molecule. Therefore, by
the end of this chemical-priming or energy-consuming phase, one glucose molecule is broken down into two
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate molecules.

 The second phase of glycolysis, the energy-yielding phase, creates the energy that is the product of glycolysis.
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase converts each three-carbon glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate produced during the

energy-consuming phase into 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. This reaction releases an electron that is then picked up by NAD* to
create an NADH molecule. NADH is a high-energy molecule, like ATP, but unlike ATP, it is not used as energy currency by
the cell. Because there are two glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate molecules, two NADH molecules are synthesized during this
step.
