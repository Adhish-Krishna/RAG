Vitamin K also supports bone mineralization and may have a synergistic role with vitamin D in the regulation of bone
growth. Green leafy vegetables are a good source of vitamin K.

The minerals magnesium and fluoride may also play a role in supporting bone health. While magnesium is only found
in trace amounts in the human body, more than 60 percent of it is in the skeleton, suggesting it plays a role in the structure
of bone. Fluoride can displace the hydroxyl group in boneâ€™s hydroxyapatite crystals and form fluorapatite. Similar to its
effect on dental enamel, fluorapatite helps stabilize and strengthen bone mineral. Fluoride can also enter spaces within
hydroxyapatite crystals, thus increasing their density.

 Omega-3 fatty acids have long been known to reduce inflammation in various parts of the body. Inflammation can
interfere with the function of osteoblasts, so consuming omega-3 fatty acids, in the diet or in supplements, may also help
enhance production of new osseous tissue.
