sample in greater detail.

 Smooth muscle fibers are spindle-shaped (wide in the middle and tapered at both ends, somewhat like a football)
and have a single nucleus; they range from about 30 to 200 mm (thousands of times shorter than skeletal muscle fibers),
and they produce their own connective tissue, endomysium.
