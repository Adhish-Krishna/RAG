Ependymal cells (one of the types of glial cells described in the introduction to the nervous system)
surround blood capillaries and filter the blood to make CSF. The fluid is a clear solution with a limited amount of the
constituents of blood. It is essentially water, small molecules, and electrolytes. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are dissolved
into the CSF, as they are in blood, and can diffuse between the fluid and the nervous tissue.

 Cerebrospinal Fluid Circulation

The choroid plexuses are found in all four ventricles. Observed in dissection, they appear as soft, fuzzy structures that may
still be pink, depending on how well the circulatory system is cleared in preparation of the tissue. The CSF is produced from
components extracted from the blood, so its flow out of the ventricles is tied to the pulse of cardiovascular circulation.
 From the lateral ventricles, the CSF flows into the third ventricle, where more CSF is produced, and then through the
cerebral aqueduct into the fourth ventricle where even more CSF is produced.
