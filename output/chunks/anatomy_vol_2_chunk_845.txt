These practices are considered illegal in virtually all sports and run the
risk of infection, significantly increasing the viscosity of the blood and the potential for transmission of blood-borne
pathogens if the blood was collected from another individual.

 With the development of synthetic EPO in the 1980s, it became possible to provide additional RBCs by artificially
stimulating RBC production in the bone marrow. Originally developed to treat patients suffering from anemia, renal
failure, or cancer treatment, large quantities of EPO can be generated by recombinant DNA technology. Synthetic EPO
is injected under the skin and can increase hematocrit for many weeks. It may also induce polycythemia and raise
hematocrit to 70 or greater. This increased viscosity raises the resistance of the blood and forces the heart to pump
more powerfully; in extreme cases, it has resulted in death. Other drugs such as cobalt II chloride have been shown
to increase natural EPO gene expression. Blood doping has become problematic in many sports, especially cycling.
