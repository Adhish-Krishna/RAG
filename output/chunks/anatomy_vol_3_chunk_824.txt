However, space restrictions limit these movements and typically force the
growing fetus into the “fetal position,” with the arms crossed and the legs bent at the knees. Sebaceous glands coat the skin
with a waxy, protective substance called vernix caseosa that protects and moisturizes the skin and may provide lubrication
during childbirth. A silky hair called lanugo also covers the skin during weeks 17—20, but it is shed as the fetus continues
to grow. Extremely premature infants sometimes exhibit residual lanugo.

 Developmental weeks 21-30 are characterized by rapid weight gain, which is important for maintaining a stable body
temperature after birth. The bone marrow completely takes over erythrocyte synthesis, and the axons of the spinal cord
begin to be myelinated, or coated in the electrically insulating glial cell sheaths that are necessary for efficient nervous
system functioning.
