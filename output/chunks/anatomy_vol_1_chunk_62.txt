Controlled Hypothermia

As you have learned, the body continuously engages in coordinated physiological processes to maintain a stable
temperature. In some cases, however, overriding this system can be useful, or even life-saving. Hypothermia is the
clinical term for an abnormally low body temperature (hypo- = “below” or “under”). Controlled hypothermia is
clinically induced hypothermia performed in order to reduce the metabolic rate of an organ or of a person’s entire body.

 Controlled hypothermia often is used, for example, during open-heart surgery because it decreases the metabolic
needs of the brain, heart, and other organs, reducing the risk of damage to them. When controlled hypothermia is used
clinically, the patient is given medication to prevent shivering. The body is then cooled to 25-32°C (79-89°F).
