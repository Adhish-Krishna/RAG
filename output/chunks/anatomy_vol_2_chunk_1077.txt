However, massive releases of these hormones coupled with sympathetic stimulation may
actually lead to arrhythmias. There is no parasympathetic stimulation to the adrenal medulla.

Thyroid Hormones

In general, increased levels of thyroid hormone, or thyroxin, increase cardiac rate and contractility. The impact of thyroid
hormone is typically of a much longer duration than that of the catecholamines. The physiologically active form of thyroid
hormone, T3 or triiodothyronine, has been shown to directly enter cardiomyocytes and alter activity at the level of the
genome. It also impacts the beta adrenergic response similar to epinephrine and NE described above. Excessive levels of
thyroxin may trigger tachycardia.

 Calcium

Calcium ion levels have great impacts upon both HR and contractility; as the levels of calcium ions increase, so do HR
and contractility. High levels of calcium ions (hypercalcemia) may be implicated in a short QT interval and a widened T
wave in the ECG.
