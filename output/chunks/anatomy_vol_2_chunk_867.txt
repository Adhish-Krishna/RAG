Clinicians often use two groupings in diagnosis: The kinetic approach
focuses on evaluating the production, destruction, and removal of RBCs, whereas the morphological approach examines the

RBCs themselves, paying particular emphasis to their size. A common test is the mean corpuscle volume (MCV), which
measures size. Normal-sized cells are referred to as normocytic, smaller-than-normal cells are referred to as microcytic, and
larger-than-normal cells are referred to as macrocytic. Reticulocyte counts are also important and may reveal inadequate
production of RBCs. The effects of the various anemias are widespread, because reduced numbers of RBCs or hemoglobin
will result in lower levels of oxygen being delivered to body tissues. Since oxygen is required for tissue functioning, anemia
produces fatigue, lethargy, and an increased risk for infection.
