The
most severe form is called Cooley’s anemia.

 ° Lead exposure from industrial sources or even dust from paint chips of iron-containing paints or pottery that has
not been properly glazed may also lead to destruction of the red marrow.

 * Various disease processes also can lead to anemias. These include chronic kidney diseases often associated with a
decreased production of EPO, hypothyroidism, some forms of cancer, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.
 In contrast to anemia, an elevated RBC count is called polycythemia and is detected in a patient’s elevated hematocrit.
 It can occur transiently in a person who is dehydrated; when water intake is inadequate or water losses are excessive,
the plasma volume falls. As a result, the hematocrit rises. For reasons mentioned earlier, a mild form of polycythemia is
chronic but normal in people living at high altitudes. Some elite athletes train at high elevations specifically to induce this
phenomenon. Finally, a type of bone marrow disease called polycythemia vera (from the Greek vera = “true”) causes an
excessive production of immature erythrocytes.
