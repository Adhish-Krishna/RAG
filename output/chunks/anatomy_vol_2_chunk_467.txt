The receptors are named for, and differentiated by, other
molecules that bind to them. Whereas nicotine will bind to the nicotinic receptor, and muscarine will bind to the muscarinic
receptor, there is no cross-reactivity between the receptors. The situation is similar to locks and keys. Imagine two
locks—one for a classroom and the other for an office—that are opened by two separate keys. The classroom key will
not open the office door and the office key will not open the classroom door. This is similar to the specificity of nicotine
and muscarine for their receptors. However, a master key can open multiple locks, such as a master key for the Biology
Department that opens both the classroom and the office doors. This is similar to ACh that binds to both types of receptors.
 The molecules that define these receptors are not crucial—they are simply tools for researchers to use in the laboratory.
