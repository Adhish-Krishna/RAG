¢ The clinician places the stethoscope on the patient’s antecubital region and, while gradually allowing air within the
cuff to escape, listens for the Korotkoff sounds.
 Although there are five recognized Korotkoff sounds, only two are normally recorded. Initially, no sounds are heard
since there is no blood flow through the vessels, but as air pressure drops, the cuff relaxes, and blood flow returns to the arm.
 As shown in Figure 20.12, the first sound heard through the stethoscope—the first Korotkoff sound—indicates systolic
pressure. As more air is released from the cuff, blood is able to flow freely through the brachial artery and all sounds
disappear. The point at which the last sound is heard is recorded as the patient’s diastolic pressure.
