The cell cycle is the sequence of events in the life
of the cell from the moment it is created at the end of a previous cycle of cell division until it then divides itself, generating
two new cells.

 The Cell Cycle

One “turn” or cycle of the cell cycle consists of two general phases: interphase, followed by mitosis and cytokinesis.
 Interphase is the period of the cell cycle during which the cell is not dividing. The majority of cells are in interphase
most of the time. Mitosis is the division of genetic material, during which the cell nucleus breaks down and two new, fully
functional, nuclei are formed. Cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm into two distinctive cells.

 Interphase

A cell grows and carries out all normal metabolic functions and processes in a period called G1 (Figure 3.30). G1 phase
(gap 1 phase) is the first gap, or growth phase in the cell cycle.
