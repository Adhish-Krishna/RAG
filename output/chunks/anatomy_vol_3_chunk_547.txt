Drugs that are structurally small can be filtered by the glomerulus
with the filtrate. Large drug molecules such as heparin or those that are bound to plasma proteins cannot be filtered and
are not readily eliminated. Some drugs can be eliminated by carrier proteins that enable secretion of the drug into the
tubule lumen. There are specific carriers that eliminate basic (such as dopamine or histamine) or acidic drugs (such as
penicillin or indomethacin). As is the case with other substances, drugs may be both filtered and reabsorbed passively along
a concentration gradient.
