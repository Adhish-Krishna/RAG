A gene on the maleâ€™s Y
chromosome called SRY is critical in stimulating a cascade of events that simultaneously stimulate testis development and
repress the development of female structures. Testosterone produced by Leydig cells in the embryonic testis stimulates the
development of male sexual organs. If testosterone is not present, female sexual organs will develop.

 Whereas the gonads and some other reproductive tissues are considered bipotential, the tissue that forms the internal
reproductive structures stems from ducts that will develop into only male (Wolffian) or female (Miillerian) structures. To be
able to reproduce as an adult, one of these systems must develop properly and the other must degrade.

 Further development of the reproductive systems occurs at puberty. The initiation of the changes that occur in puberty
is the result of a decrease in sensitivity to negative feedback in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, and an increase in
sensitivity of the gonads to FSH and LH stimulation.
