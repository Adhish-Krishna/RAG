Often, the action potentials occur so rapidly that watching a screen to see them occur is not helpful. A
speaker is powered by the signals recorded from a neuron and it “pops” each time the neuron fires an action potential.
 These action potentials are firing so fast that it sounds like static on the radio. Electrophysiologists can recognize the
patterns within that static to understand what is happening. Why is the leech model used for measuring the electrical
activity of neurons instead of using humans?

12.5 | Communication Between Neurons

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 ¢ Explain the differences between the types of graded potentials
* Categorize the major neurotransmitters by chemical type and effect

The electrical changes taking place within a neuron, as described in the previous section, are similar to a light switch being
turned on.
