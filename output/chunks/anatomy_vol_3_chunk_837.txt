These changes can sometimes prompt
symptoms often referred to collectively as the common discomforts of pregnancy.

 Digestive and Urinary System Changes

Nausea and vomiting, sometimes triggered by an increased sensitivity to odors, are common during the first few weeks
to months of pregnancy. This phenomenon is often referred to as “morning sickness,” although the nausea may persist all
day. The source of pregnancy nausea is thought to be the increased circulation of pregnancy-related hormones, specifically
circulating estrogen, progesterone, and hCG. Decreased intestinal peristalsis may also contribute to nausea. By about week
12 of pregnancy, nausea typically subsides.

 A common gastrointestinal complaint during the later stages of pregnancy is gastric reflux, or heartburn, which results
from the upward, constrictive pressure of the growing uterus on the stomach. The same decreased peristalsis that may
contribute to nausea in early pregnancy is also thought to be responsible for pregnancy-related constipation as pregnancy
progresses.
