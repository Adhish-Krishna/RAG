Younger and immature neutrophils begin to develop
lobes and are known as “bands.”

 Neutrophils are rapid responders to the site of infection and are efficient phagocytes with a preference for bacteria.
 Their granules include lysozyme, an enzyme capable of lysing, or breaking down, bacterial cell walls; oxidants such as
hydrogen peroxide; and defensins, proteins that bind to and puncture bacterial and fungal plasma membranes, so that
the cell contents leak out. Abnormally high counts of neutrophils indicate infection and/or inflammation, particularly
triggered by bacteria, but are also found in burn patients and others experiencing unusual stress. A burn injury increases the
proliferation of neutrophils in order to fight off infection that can result from the destruction of the barrier of the skin. Low
counts may be caused by drug toxicity and other disorders, and may increase an individual’s susceptibility to infection.

 Eosinophils typically represent 2-4 percent of total leukocyte count. They are also 10-12 ym in diameter.
