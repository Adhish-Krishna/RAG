This reabsorption causes a reduction of the osmolarity of the
blood, diluting the blood to the appropriate level. The regulation of blood glucose is another example. High blood glucose
levels cause the release of insulin from the pancreas, which increases glucose uptake by cells and liver storage of glucose
as glycogen.

 An endocrine gland may also secrete a hormone in response to the presence of another hormone produced by a different
endocrine gland. Such hormonal stimuli often involve the hypothalamus, which produces releasing and inhibiting hormones
that control the secretion of a variety of pituitary hormones.

 In addition to these chemical signals, hormones can also be released in response to neural stimuli. A common example
of neural stimuli is the activation of the fight-or-flight response by the sympathetic nervous system. When an individual
perceives danger, sympathetic neurons signal the adrenal glands to secrete norepinephrine and epinephrine. The two
hormones dilate blood vessels, increase the heart and respiratory rate, and suppress the digestive and immune systems.
