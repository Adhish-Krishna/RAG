Serotonin is transported back into the presynaptic cell for repackaging.

 Other biogenic amines are made from tyrosine, and include dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Dopamine
is part of its own system, the dopaminergic system, which has dopamine receptors. Dopamine is removed from the
synapse by transport proteins in the presynaptic cell membrane. Norepinephrine and epinephrine belong to the adrenergic
neurotransmitter system. The two molecules are very similar and bind to the same receptors, which are referred to as
pha and beta receptors. Norepinephrine and epinephrine are also transported back into the presynaptic cell. The chemical
epinephrine (epi- = “on”; “-nephrine” = kidney) is also known as adrenaline (renal = “kidney”), and norepinephrine is
sometimes referred to as noradrenaline. The adrenal gland produces epinephrine and norepinephrine to be released into the
blood stream as hormones.

 A neuropeptide is a neurotransmitter molecule made up of chains of amino acids connected by peptide bonds.
