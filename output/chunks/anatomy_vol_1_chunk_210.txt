Lipoproteins are compounds in which the hydrophobic triglycerides are packaged in protein envelopes for transport in body
fluids.

 Phospholipids

As its name suggests, a phospholipid is a bond between the glycerol component of a lipid and a phosphorous molecule.
 In fact, phospholipids are similar in structure to triglycerides. However, instead of having three fatty acids, a phospholipid
is generated from a diglyceride, a glycerol with just two fatty acid chains (Figure 2.23). The third binding site on the
glycerol is taken up by the phosphate group, which in turn is attached to a polar “head” region of the molecule. Recall that
triglycerides are nonpolar and hydrophobic. This still holds for the fatty acid portion of a phospholipid compound. However,
the phosphate-containing group at the head of the compound is polar and thereby hydrophilic. In other words, one end of
the molecule can interact with oil, and the other end with water.
