If it is the mother who is affected, all of her children—male or female—would have a 50 percent chance of
inheriting the disorder because she can only pass an X chromosome on to her children (see Figure 28.28b). For an affected
female, the inheritance pattern would be identical to that of an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern in which one parent
is heterozygous and the other is homozygous for the normal gene.
