The cell membrane is a phospholipid bilayer, so only substances that can pass
directly through the hydrophobic core can diffuse through unaided. Charged particles, which are hydrophilic by definition,
cannot pass through the cell membrane without assistance (Figure 12.17). Transmembrane proteins, specifically channel
proteins, make this possible. Several channels, as well as specialized energy dependent “ion-pumps,” are necessary to
generate a transmembrane potential and to generate an action potential. Of special interest is the carrier protein referred to as

the sodium/potassium pump that moves sodium ions (Na*) out of a cell and potassium ions (K*) into a cell, thus regulating
ion concentration on both sides of the cell membrane.

bilayer and has many transmembrane proteins, including different types of channel proteins that serve as ion channels.
