Thrombophilia,
also called hypercoagulation, is a condition in which there is a tendency to form thrombosis. This may be familial (genetic)
or acquired. Acquired forms include the autoimmune disease lupus, immune reactions to heparin, polycythemia vera,
thrombocytosis, sickle cell disease, pregnancy, and even obesity. A thrombus can seriously impede blood flow to or from a
region and will cause a local increase in blood pressure. If flow is to be maintained, the heart will need to generate a greater
pressure to overcome the resistance.

 When a portion of a thrombus breaks free from the vessel wall and enters the circulation, it is referred to as an embolus.
 An embolus that is carried through the bloodstream can be large enough to block a vessel critical to a major organ. When
it becomes trapped, an embolus is called an embolism. In the heart, brain, or lungs, an embolism may accordingly cause a
heart attack, a stroke, or a pulmonary embolism.
