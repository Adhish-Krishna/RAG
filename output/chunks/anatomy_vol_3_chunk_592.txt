It is most common in the soft tissues of the extremities.
 The physiological causes of edema include water leakage from blood capillaries. Edema is almost always caused by
an underlying medical condition, by the use of certain therapeutic drugs, by pregnancy, by localized injury, or by an
allergic reaction. In the limbs, the symptoms of edema include swelling of the subcutaneous tissues, an increase in the
normal size of the limb, and stretched, tight skin. One quick way to check for subcutaneous edema localized in a limb
is to press a finger into the suspected area. Edema is likely if the depression persists for several seconds after the finger
is removed (which is called “pitting”).

 Pulmonary edema is excess fluid in the air sacs of the lungs, a common symptom of heart and/or kidney
failure. People with pulmonary edema likely will experience difficulty breathing, and they may experience chest pain.
 Pulmonary edema can be life threatening, because it compromises gas exchange in the lungs, and anyone having
symptoms should immediately seek medical care.
