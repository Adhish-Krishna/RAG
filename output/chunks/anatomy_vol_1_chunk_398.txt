Its primary function is to provide a smooth and protective surface. Mesothelial cells are squamous epithelial cells
that secrete a fluid that lubricates the mesothelium.

 In simple cuboidal epithelium, the nucleus of the box-like cells appears round and is generally located near the center
of the cell. These epithelia are active in the secretion and absorptions of molecules. Simple cuboidal epithelia are observed
in the lining of the kidney tubules and in the ducts of glands.

 In simple columnar epithelium, the nucleus of the tall column-like cells tends to be elongated and located in the
basal end of the cells. Like the cuboidal epithelia, this epithelium is active in the absorption and secretion of molecules.
 Simple columnar epithelium forms the lining of some sections of the digestive system and parts of the female reproductive
tract. Ciliated columnar epithelium is composed of simple columnar epithelial cells with cilia on their apical surfaces. These
epithelial cells are found in the lining of the fallopian tubes and parts of the respiratory system, where the beating of the
cilia helps remove particulate matter.
