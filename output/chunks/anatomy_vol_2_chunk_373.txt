Figure 14.20 Auditory Brain Stem Mechanisms of Sound Localization Localizing sound in the horizontal plane is
achieved by processing in the medullary nuclei of the auditory system. Connections between neurons on either side
are able to compare very slight differences in sound stimuli that arrive at either ear and represent interaural time and
intensity differences.

 Auditory processing continues on to a nucleus in the midbrain called the inferior colliculus. Axons from the inferior
colliculus project to two locations, the thalamus and the superior colliculus. The medial geniculate nucleus of the
thalamus receives the auditory information and then projects that information to the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe of
the cerebral cortex. The superior colliculus receives input from the visual and somatosensory systems, as well as the ears,
to initiate stimulation of the muscles that turn the head and neck toward the auditory stimulus.

 Balance is coordinated through the vestibular system, the nerves of which are composed of axons from the vestibular
ganglion that carries information from the utricle, saccule, and semicircular canals.
