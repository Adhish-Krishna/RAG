By the time blood has passed through capillaries and entered venules, the pressure initially exerted upon it by heart
contractions has diminished. In other words, in comparison to arteries, venules and veins withstand a much lower pressure
from the blood that flows through them. Their walls are considerably thinner and their lumens are correspondingly larger
in diameter, allowing more blood to flow with less vessel resistance. In addition, many veins of the body, particularly those
of the limbs, contain valves that assist the unidirectional flow of blood toward the heart. This is critical because blood flow
becomes sluggish in the extremities, as a result of the lower pressure and the effects of gravity.

 The walls of arteries and veins are largely composed of living cells and their products (including collagenous and
elastic fibers); the cells require nourishment and produce waste.
