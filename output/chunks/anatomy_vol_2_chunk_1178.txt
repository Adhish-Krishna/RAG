This pressure gradient drives blood back toward the heart. Again,
the presence of one-way valves and the skeletal muscle and respiratory pumps contribute to this increased flow. Since
approximately 64 percent of the total blood volume resides in systemic veins, any action that increases the flow of blood
through the veins will increase venous return to the heart. Maintaining vascular tone within the veins prevents the veins
from merely distending, dampening the flow of blood, and as you will see, vasoconstriction actually enhances the flow.

 The Role of Venoconstriction in Resistance, Blood Pressure, and Flow

As previously discussed, vasoconstriction of an artery or arteriole decreases the radius, increasing resistance and pressure,
but decreasing flow. Venoconstriction, on the other hand, has a very different outcome. The walls of veins are thin but
irregular; thus, when the smooth muscle in those walls constricts, the lumen becomes more rounded.
