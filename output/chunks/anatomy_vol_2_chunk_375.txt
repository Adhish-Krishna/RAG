To assist the visual system, fibers of the vestibular nuclei project to the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nuclei to
influence signals sent along the cranial nerves. These connections constitute the pathway of the vestibulo-ocular reflex
(VOR), which compensates for head and body movement by stabilizing images on the retina (Figure 14.21). Finally, the
vestibular nuclei project to the thalamus to join the proprioceptive pathway of the dorsal column system, allowing conscious
perception of equilibrium.
