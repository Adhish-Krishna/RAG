The round ligament attaches to the uterus near the uterine tubes, and extends to the labia majora. Finally,
the uterosacral ligament stabilizes the uterus posteriorly by its connection from the cervix to the pelvic wall.

1224 CHAPTER 27 | THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM

The wall of the uterus is made up of three layers. The most superficial layer is the serous membrane, or perimetrium,
which consists of epithelial tissue that covers the exterior portion of the uterus. The middle layer, or myometrium, is a thick
layer of smooth muscle responsible for uterine contractions. Most of the uterus is myometrial tissue, and the muscle fibers
run horizontally, vertically, and diagonally, allowing the powerful contractions that occur during labor and the less powerful
contractions (or cramps) that help to expel menstrual blood during a womanâ€™s period.
