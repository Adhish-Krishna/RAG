Oxytocin is continually released throughout childbirth
through a positive feedback mechanism. As noted earlier, oxytocin prompts uterine contractions that push the fetal head
toward the cervix. In response, cervical stretching stimulates additional oxytocin to be synthesized by the hypothalamus
and released from the pituitary. This increases the intensity and effectiveness of uterine contractions and prompts additional
dilation of the cervix. The feedback loop continues until birth.

 Although the mother’s high blood levels of oxytocin begin to decrease immediately following birth, oxytocin continues
to play a role in maternal and newborn health. First, oxytocin is necessary for the milk ejection reflex (commonly referred to
as “let-down”) in breastfeeding women. As the newborn begins suckling, sensory receptors in the nipples transmit signals to
the hypothalamus. In response, oxytocin is secreted and released into the bloodstream. Within seconds, cells in the mother’s
milk ducts contract, ejecting milk into the infant’s mouth.
