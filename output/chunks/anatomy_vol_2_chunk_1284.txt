In addition to blood supply from the external and internal iliac veins, the middle sacral vein drains the
sacral region into the common iliac vein. Similar to the common iliac arteries, the common iliac veins come together at the
level of L5 to form the inferior vena cava.

 Figure 20.42 is a flow chart of veins flowing into the lower limb. Table 20.16 summarizes the major veins of the lower
limbs.
