CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 811

Everyday CONNECTION

External Automated Defibrillators

In the event that the electrical activity of the heart is severely disrupted, cessation of electrical activity or fibrillation
may occur. In fibrillation, the heart beats in a wild, uncontrolled manner, which prevents it from being able to pump
effectively. Atrial fibrillation (see Figure 19.25b) is a serious condition, but as long as the ventricles continue to pump
blood, the patient’s life may not be in immediate danger. Ventricular fibrillation (see Figure 19.25d) is a medical
emergency that requires life support, because the ventricles are not effectively pumping blood. In a hospital setting,
it is often described as “code blue.” If untreated for as little as a few minutes, ventricular fibrillation may lead to
brain death.
