The diverting of resources away
from the adaptive immune response, however, causes its own share of problems in fighting disease.

 Chronic stress, unlike short-term stress, may inhibit immune responses even in otherwise healthy adults. The
suppression of both innate and adaptive immune responses is clearly associated with increases in some diseases, as
seen when individuals lose a spouse or have other long-term stresses, such as taking care of a spouse with a fatal

to make exciting advances in our understanding of how the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems have evolved
together and communicate with each other.

964 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM

KEY TERMS
active immunity immunity developed from an individualâ€™s own immune system
acute inflammation inflammation occurring for a limited time period; rapidly developing

adaptive immune response relatively slow but very specific and effective immune response controlled by
lymphocytes

afferent lymphatic vessels lead into a lymph node
antibody antigen-specific protein secreted by plasma cells; immunoglobulin

antigen presentation binding of processed antigen to the protein-binding cleft of a major histocompatibility complex
molecule

antigen processing internalization and digestion of antigen in an antigen-presenting cell
antigen receptor two-chain receptor by which lymphocytes recognize antigen
antigen molecule recognized by the receptors of B and T lymphocytes

antigenic determinant (also, epitope)
