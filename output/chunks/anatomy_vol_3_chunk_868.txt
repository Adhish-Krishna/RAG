As the infant goes
through growth spurts, the milk supply constantly adjusts to accommodate changes in demand. A woman can continue to
lactate for years, but once breastfeeding is stopped for approximately 1 week, any remaining milk will be reabsorbed; in
most cases, no more will be produced, even if suckling or pumping is resumed.

 Mature milk changes from the beginning to the end of a feeding. The early milk, called foremilk, is watery, translucent,
and rich in lactose and protein. Its purpose is to quench the infant’s thirst. Hindmilk is delivered toward the end of a feeding.
 It is opaque, creamy, and rich in fat, and serves to satisfy the infant’s appetite.

 During the first days of a newborn’s life, it is important for meconium to be cleared from the intestines and for bilirubin
to be kept low in the circulation.
