During isometric contractions, muscle length does not change because the load exceeds the tension the muscle can
generate.

 All of these muscle activities are under the exquisite control of the nervous system. Neural control regulates concentric,
eccentric and isometric contractions, muscle fiber recruitment, and muscle tone. A crucial aspect of nervous system control
of skeletal muscles is the role of motor units.

 Motor Units

As you have learned, every skeletal muscle fiber must be innervated by the axon terminal of a motor neuron in order
to contract. Each muscle fiber is innervated by only one motor neuron. The actual group of muscle fibers in a muscle
innervated by a single motor neuron is called a motor unit. The size of a motor unit is variable depending on the nature of
the muscle.

 A small motor unit is an arrangement where a single motor neuron supplies a small number of muscle fibers in a
muscle.
