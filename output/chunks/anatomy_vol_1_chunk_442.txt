High levels of NSAIDs reduce inflammation. Antihistamines decrease allergies by blocking histamine receptors and as a
result the histamine response.
 After containment of an injury, the tissue repair phase starts with removal of toxins and waste products. Clotting
(coagulation) reduces blood loss from damaged blood vessels and forms a network of fibrin proteins that trap blood cells
and bind the edges of the wound together. A scab forms when the clot dries, reducing the risk of infection. Sometimes
a mixture of dead leukocytes and fluid called pus accumulates in the wound. As healing progresses, fibroblasts from the
surrounding connective tissues replace the collagen and extracellular material lost by the injury. Angiogenesis, the growth
of new blood vessels, results in vascularization of the new tissue known as granulation tissue. The clot retracts pulling the
edges of the wound together, and it slowly dissolves as the tissue is repaired. When a large amount of granulation tissue
forms and capillaries disappear, a pale scar is often visible in the healed area.
