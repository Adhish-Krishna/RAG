A more complex exchange reaction might be:
AB+CD — AC + BD. Another example might be: AB +CD > AD+BC.

 In theory, any chemical reaction can proceed in either direction under the right conditions. Reactants may synthesize
into a product that is later decomposed. Reversibility is also a quality of exchange reactions. For instance,
A+BC— AB+C could then reverse to AB +C — A+BC. This reversibility of a chemical reaction is indicated
with a double arrow: A+ BC 2 AB+C. Still, in the human body, many chemical reactions do proceed in a predictable
direction, either one way or the other. You can think of this more predictable path as the path of least resistance because,
ypically, the alternate direction requires more energy.

Factors Influencing the Rate of Chemical Reactions

If you pour vinegar into baking soda, the reaction is instantaneous; the concoction will bubble and fizz.
