When two hydrogen atoms each share their single electron with
oxygen, covalent bonds are formed, resulting in a molecule of water, H20.

 In nature, atoms of one element tend to join with atoms of other elements in characteristic ways. For example, carbon
commonly fills its valence shell by linking up with four atoms of hydrogen. In so doing, the two elements form the simplest
of organic molecules, methane, which also is one of the most abundant and stable carbon-containing compounds on Earth.
 As stated above, another example is water; oxygen needs two electrons to fill its valence shell. It commonly interacts

with two atoms of hydrogen, forming H20. Incidentally, the name “hydrogen” reflects its contribution to water (hydro- =
“water”; -gen = “maker”).
