As
another example, bones contain long threads of a protein called collagen that acts as scaffolding upon which bone minerals
are deposited. These elongated proteins, called fibrous proteins, are strong and durable and typically hydrophobic.

 In contrast, globular proteins are globes or spheres that tend to be highly reactive and are hydrophilic. The hemoglobin
proteins packed into red blood cells are an example (see Figure 2.26d); however, globular proteins are abundant throughout
the body, playing critical roles in most body functions. Enzymes, introduced earlier as protein catalysts, are examples of
this. The next section takes a closer look at the action of enzymes.

Proteins Function as Enzymes

If you were trying to type a paper, and every time you hit a key on your laptop there was a delay of six or seven minutes
before you got a response, you would probably get a new laptop.
