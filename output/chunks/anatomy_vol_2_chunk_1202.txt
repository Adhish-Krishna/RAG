Figure 20.19 Hormones Involved in Renal Contro! of Blood Pressure In the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
mechanism, increasing angiotensin II will stimulate the production of antidiuretic hormone and aldosterone. In addition
to renin, the kidneys produce erythropoietin, which stimulates the production of red blood cells, further increasing blood
volume.

 Erythropoietin

Erythropoietin (EPO) is released by the kidneys when blood flow and/or oxygen levels decrease. EPO stimulates the
production of erythrocytes within the bone marrow. Erythrocytes are the major formed element of the blood and may
contribute 40 percent or more to blood volume, a significant factor of viscosity, resistance, pressure, and flow.
