The kidney
can function normally under a wide range of blood pressures due to the autoregulatory nature of smooth muscle.

25.6 Tubular Reabsorption

The kidney regulates water recovery and blood pressure by producing the enzyme renin. It is renin that starts a series of
reactions, leading to the production of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II and the salt-retaining steroid aldosterone. Water
recovery is also powerfully and directly influenced by the hormone ADH. Even so, it only influences the last 10 percent of
water available for recovery after filtration at the glomerulus, because 90 percent of water is recovered before reaching the
collecting ducts. Depending on the bodyâ€™s fluid status at any given time, the collecting ducts can recover none or almost all
of the water reaching them.

 Mechanisms of solute recovery include active transport, simple diffusion, and facilitated diffusion. Most filtered
substances are reabsorbed. Urea, NH3, creatinine, and some drugs are filtered or secreted as wastes.
