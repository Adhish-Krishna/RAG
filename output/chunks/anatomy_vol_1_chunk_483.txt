In addition, the papillary layer contains phagocytes, defensive cells that help fight
bacteria or other infections that have breached the skin. This layer also contains lymphatic capillaries, nerve fibers, and
touch receptors called the Meissner corpuscles.

 Reticular Layer

Underlying the papillary layer is the much thicker reticular layer, composed of dense, irregular connective tissue. This
layer is well vascularized and has a rich sensory and sympathetic nerve supply. The reticular layer appears reticulated (net-
like) due to a tight meshwork of fibers. Elastin fibers provide some elasticity to the skin, enabling movement. Collagen
fibers provide structure and tensile strength, with strands of collagen extending into both the papillary layer and the
hypodermis. In addition, collagen binds water to keep the skin hydrated. Collagen injections and Retin-A creams help
restore skin turgor by either introducing collagen externally or stimulating blood flow and repair of the dermis, respectively.

Hypodermis

The hypodermis (also called the subcutaneous layer or superficial fascia) is a layer directly below the dermis and serves
to connect the skin to the underlying fascia (fibrous tissue) of the bones and muscles.
