A synchondrosis may be temporary or permanent. A temporary synchondrosis is
the epiphyseal plate (growth plate) of a growing long bone. The epiphyseal plate is the region of growing hyaline cartilage
that unites the diaphysis (shaft) of the bone to the epiphysis (end of the bone). Bone lengthening involves growth of the
epiphyseal plate cartilage and its replacement by bone, which adds to the diaphysis. For many years during childhood
growth, the rates of cartilage growth and bone formation are equal and thus the epiphyseal plate does not change in overall
thickness as the bone lengthens. During the late teens and early 20s, growth of the cartilage slows and eventually stops. The
epiphyseal plate is then completely replaced by bone, and the diaphysis and epiphysis portions of the bone fuse together
to form a single adult bone. This fusion of the diaphysis and epiphysis is a synostosis. Once this occurs, bone lengthening
ceases. For this reason, the epiphyseal plate is considered to be a temporary synchondrosis.
