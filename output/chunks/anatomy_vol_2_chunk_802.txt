In contrast,
hydrophilic hormones must interact with cell membrane receptors. These are typically associated with a G protein, which
becomes activated when the hormone binds the receptor. This initiates a signaling cascade that involves a second messenger,
such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Second messenger systems greatly amplify the hormone signal, creating
a broader, more efficient, and faster response.
 Hormones are released upon stimulation that is of either chemical or neural origin. Regulation of hormone release is
primarily achieved through negative feedback. Various stimuli may cause the release of hormones, but there are three major

types. Humoral stimuli are changes in ion or nutrient levels in the blood. Hormonal stimuli are changes in hormone levels
that initiate or inhibit the secretion of another hormone. Finally, a neural stimulus occurs when a nerve impulse prompts the
secretion or inhibition of a hormone.
