The marginal arteries supply blood to the superficial portions of the right ventricle. On the
posterior surface of the heart, the right coronary artery gives rise to the posterior interventricular artery, also known as
the posterior descending artery. It runs along the posterior portion of the interventricular sulcus toward the apex of the heart,
giving rise to branches that supply the interventricular septum and portions of both ventricles. Figure 19.15 presents views
of the coronary circulation from both the anterior and posterior views.
