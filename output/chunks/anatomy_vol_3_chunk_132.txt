Typically, intrapleural pressure is lower, or negative to, intra-alveolar pressure. The difference
in pressure between intrapleural and intra-alveolar pressures is called transpulmonary pressure. In addition, intra-alveolar
pressure will equalize with the atmospheric pressure. Pressure is determined by the volume of the space occupied by a gas
and is influenced by resistance. Air flows when a pressure gradient is created, from a space of higher pressure to a space of
lower pressure. Boyleâ€™s law describes the relationship between volume and pressure. A gas is at lower pressure in a larger
volume because the gas molecules have more space to in which to move. The same quantity of gas in a smaller volume
results in gas molecules crowding together, producing increased pressure.

 Resistance is created by inelastic surfaces, as well as the diameter of the airways. Resistance reduces the flow of gases.
 The surface tension of the alveoli also influences pressure, as it opposes the expansion of the alveoli.
