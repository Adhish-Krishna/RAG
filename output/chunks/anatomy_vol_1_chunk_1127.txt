 There are also skeletal muscles that do not pull against the skeleton for movements. For example, there are the muscles
that produce facial expressions. The insertions and origins of facial muscles are in the skin, so that certain individual
muscles contract to form a smile or frown, form sounds or words, and raise the eyebrows. There also are skeletal muscles
in the tongue, and the external urinary and anal sphincters that allow for voluntary regulation of urination and defecation,
respectively.
