In addition, the thick intervertebral disc provides cushioning between the vertebrae, which
is important when carrying heavy objects or during high-impact activities such as running or jumping.

 9.4 | Synovial Joints

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the structural features of a synovial joint
¢ Discuss the function of additional structures associated with synovial joints
 ¢ List the six types of synovial joints and give an example of each

Synovial joints are the most common type of joint in the body (Figure 9.8). A key structural characteristic for a synovial
joint that is not seen at fibrous or cartilaginous joints is the presence of a joint cavity. This fluid-filled space is the site at
which the articulating surfaces of the bones contact each other. Also unlike fibrous or cartilaginous joints, the articulating
bone surfaces at a synovial joint are not directly connected to each other with fibrous connective tissue or cartilage.
