What are the functions of the articular cartilage?

Hip Joint

The hip joint is a multiaxial ball-and-socket joint between the head of the femur and the acetabulum of the hip bone (Figure
9.18). The hip carries the weight of the body and thus requires strength and stability during standing and walking. For these
reasons, its range of motion is more limited than at the shoulder joint.

 The acetabulum is the socket portion of the hip joint. This space is deep and has a large articulation area for the femoral
head, thus giving stability and weight bearing ability to the joint. The acetabulum is further deepened by the acetabular
labrum, a fibrocartilage lip attached to the outer margin of the acetabulum. The surrounding articular capsule is strong,
with several thickened areas forming intrinsic ligaments. These ligaments arise from the hip bone, at the margins of the
acetabulum, and attach to the femur at the base of the neck.
