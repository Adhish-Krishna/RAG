Most absorption occurs in the small intestine.

 Chemical Digestion

Large food molecules (for example, proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and starches) must be broken down into subunits that are
small enough to be absorbed by the lining of the alimentary canal. This is accomplished by enzymes through hydrolysis.
 The many enzymes involved in chemical digestion are summarized in Table 23.8.
