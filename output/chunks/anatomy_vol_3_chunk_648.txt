Body fluids are aqueous solutions with differing concentrations of materials, called solutes.
 An appropriate balance of water and solute concentrations must be maintained to ensure cellular functions. If the cytosol
becomes too concentrated due to water loss, cell functions deteriorate. If the cytosol becomes too dilute due to water
intake by cells, cell membranes can be damaged, and the cell can burst. Hydrostatic pressure is the force exerted by a fluid
against a wall and causes movement of fluid between compartments. Fluid can also move between compartments along
an osmotic gradient. Active transport processes require ATP to move some solutes against their concentration gradients
between compartments. Passive transport of a molecule or ion depends on its ability to pass easily through the membrane,
as well as the existence of a high to low concentration gradient.

 26.2 Water Balance

Homeostasis requires that water intake and output be balanced. Most water intake comes through the digestive tract via
liquids and food, but roughly 10 percent of water available to the body is generated at the end of aerobic respiration during
cellular metabolism.
