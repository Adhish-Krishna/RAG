The atria begin to contract following depolarization of the atria and pump blood into
the ventricles. The ventricles begin to contract, raising pressure within the ventricles. When ventricular pressure rises above the
pressure in the two major arteries, blood pushes open the two semilunar valves and moves into the pulmonary trunk and aorta in
the ventricular ejection phase. Following ventricular repolarization, the ventricles begin to relax, and pressure within the ventricles
drops. When the pressure falls below that of the atria, blood moves from the atria into the ventricles, opening the atrioventricular
valves and marking one complete heart cycle. 34 Increasing EDV increases the sarcomeresâ€™ lengths within the cardiac muscle
cells, allowing more cross bridge formation between the myosin and actin and providing for a more powerful contraction. This
relationship is described in the Frank-Starling mechanism. 35 Afterload represents the resistance within the arteries to the flow of
blood ejected from the ventricles. If uncompensated, if afterload increases, flow will decrease.
