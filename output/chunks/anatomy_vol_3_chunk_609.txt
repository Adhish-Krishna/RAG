Hyponatremia is a lower-than-normal concentration of sodium, usually associated with excess water accumulation in
the body, which dilutes the sodium. An absolute loss of sodium may be due to a decreased intake of the ion coupled with
its continual excretion in the urine. An abnormal loss of sodium from the body can result from several conditions, including
excessive sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea; the use of diuretics; excessive production of urine, which can occur in diabetes;
and acidosis, either metabolic acidosis or diabetic ketoacidosis.

 A relative decrease in blood sodium can occur because of an imbalance of sodium in one of the bodyâ€™s other fluid
compartments, like IF, or from a dilution of sodium due to water retention related to edema or congestive heart failure.
 At the cellular level, hyponatremia results in increased entry of water into cells by osmosis, because the concentration of
solutes within the cell exceeds the concentration of solutes in the now-diluted ECF.
