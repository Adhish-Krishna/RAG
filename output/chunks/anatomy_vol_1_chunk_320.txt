The interpretation of genes works in the following way. Recall that proteins are polymers, or chains, of many amino
acid building blocks. The sequence of bases in a gene (that is, its sequence of A, T, C, G nucleotides) translates to an amino
acid sequence. A triplet is a section of three DNA bases in a row that codes for a specific amino acid. Similar to the way in
which the three-letter code d-o-g signals the image of a dog, the three-letter DNA base code signals the use of a particular
amino acid. For example, the DNA triplet CAC (cytosine, adenine, and cytosine) specifies the amino acid valine. Therefore,

a gene, which is composed of multiple triplets in a unique sequence, provides the code to build an entire protein, with
multiple amino acids in the proper sequence (Figure 3.25).
