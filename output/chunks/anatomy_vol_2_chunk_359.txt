The three types of cone opsins, being sensitive to different wavelengths of light, provide us with color vision. By
comparing the activity of the three different cones, the brain can extract color information from visual stimuli. For example,
a bright blue light that has a wavelength of approximately 450 nm would activate the “red” cones minimally, the “green”
cones marginally, and the “blue” cones predominantly. The relative activation of the three different cones is calculated by
the brain, which perceives the color as blue. However, cones cannot react to low-intensity light, and rods do not sense the
color of light. Therefore, our low-light vision is—in essence—in grayscale. In other words, in a dark room, everything
appears as a shade of gray. If you think that you can see colors in the dark, it is most likely because your brain knows what
color something is and is relying on that memory.
