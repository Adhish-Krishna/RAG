There are two major
subtypes of cytokines known as colony-stimulating factors and interleukins.

 ° Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) are glycoproteins that act locally, as autocrine or paracrine factors. Some
trigger the differentiation of myeloblasts into granular leukocytes, namely, neutrophils, eosinophils, and
basophils. These are referred to as granulocyte CSFs. A different CSF induces the production of monocytes,
called monocyte CSFs. Both granulocytes and monocytes are stimulated by GM-CSF; granulocytes, monocytes,
platelets, and erythrocytes are stimulated by multi-CSF. Synthetic forms of these hormones are often administered
to patients with various forms of cancer who are receiving chemotherapy to revive their WBC counts.

 ° Interleukins are another class of cytokine signaling molecules important in hemopoiesis. They were initially
thought to be secreted uniquely by leukocytes and to communicate only with other leukocytes, and were named
accordingly, but are now known to be produced by a variety of cells including bone marrow and endothelium.
