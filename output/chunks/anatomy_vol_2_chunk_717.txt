By the end of this section, you will be able to:

¢ Explain the interrelationships of the anatomy and functions of the hypothalamus and the posterior and anterior lobes
of the pituitary gland

¢ Identify the two hormones released from the posterior pituitary, their target cells, and their principal actions

¢ Identify the six hormones produced by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, their target cells, their principal
actions, and their regulation by the hypothalamus

The hypothalamus-pituitary complex can be thought of as the “command center” of the endocrine system.
