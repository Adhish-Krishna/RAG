This section will examine the gross anatomy of bone first and then move on to its histology.

Gross Anatomy of Bone

The structure of a long bone allows for the best visualization of all of the parts of a bone (Figure 6.7). A long bone has two
parts: the diaphysis and the epiphysis. The diaphysis is the tubular shaft that runs between the proximal and distal ends of
the bone. The hollow region in the diaphysis is called the medullary cavity, which is filled with yellow marrow. The walls
of the diaphysis are composed of dense and hard compact bone.
