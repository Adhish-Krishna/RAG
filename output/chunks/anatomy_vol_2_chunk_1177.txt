This in turn promotes the return of blood from the
thoracic veins to the atria. During exhalation, when air pressure increases within the thoracic cavity, pressure in the thoracic
veins increases, speeding blood flow into the heart while valves in the veins prevent blood from flowing backward from the
thoracic and abdominal veins.

 Pressure Relationships in the Venous System

Although vessel diameter increases from the smaller venules to the larger veins and eventually to the venae cavae (singular
= vena cava), the total cross-sectional area actually decreases (see Figure 20.15a and b). The individual veins are larger in
diameter than the venules, but their total number is much lower, so their total cross-sectional area is also lower.

 Also notice that, as blood moves from venules to veins, the average blood pressure drops (see Figure 20.15c), but
the blood velocity actually increases (see Figure 20.15).
