All o
these articulations are enclosed within a single articular capsule. The knee functions as a hinge joint, allowing flexion and
extension of the leg. This action is generated by both rolling and gliding motions of the femur on the tibia. In addition, some
rotation of the leg is available when the knee is flexed, but not when extended. The knee is well constructed for weight
bearing in its extended position, but is vulnerable to injuries associated with hyperextension, twisting, or blows to the medial
or lateral side of the joint, particularly while weight bearing.

 At the femoropatellar joint, the patella slides vertically within a groove on the distal femur. The patella is a sesamoid
bone incorporated into the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle, the large muscle of the anterior thigh. The patella serves
to protect the quadriceps tendon from friction against the distal femur. Continuing from the patella to the anterior tibia just
below the knee is the patellar ligament.
