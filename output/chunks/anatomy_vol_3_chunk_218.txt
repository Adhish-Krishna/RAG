The stomach wall is adapted for the functions of the stomach. In the
epithelium, gastric pits lead to gastric glands that secrete gastric juice. The gastric glands (one gland is shown enlarged
on the right) contain different types of cells that secrete a variety of enzymes, including hydrochloride acid, which

activates the protein-digesting enzyme pepsin.

1042 CHAPTER 23 | THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM

The stomach mucosaâ€™s epithelial lining consists only of surface mucus cells, which secrete a protective coat of alkaline
mucus. A vast number of gastric pits dot the surface of the epithelium, giving it the appearance of a well-used pincushion,
and mark the entry to each gastric gland, which secretes a complex digestive fluid referred to as gastric juice.

 Although the walls of the gastric pits are made up primarily of mucus cells, the gastric glands are made up of different
types of cells.
