Mean is a statistical concept and is calculated by taking the sum of the values
divided by the number of values. Although complicated to measure directly and complicated to calculate, MAP can be
approximated by adding the diastolic pressure to one-third of the pulse pressure or systolic pressure minus the diastolic
pressure:

MAP = diastolic BP + (systolic astole BP)

In Figure 20.10, this value is approximately 80 + (120 â€” 80) / 3, or 93.33. Normally, the MAP falls within the range of
70-110 mm Hg. If the value falls below 60 mm Hg for an extended time, blood pressure will not be high enough to ensure
circulation to and through the tissues, which results in ischemia, or insufficient blood flow. A condition called hypoxia,
inadequate oxygenation of tissues, commonly accompanies ischemia. The term hypoxemia refers to low levels of oxygen in
systemic arterial blood. Neurons are especially sensitive to hypoxia and may die or be damaged if blood flow and oxygen
supplies are not quickly restored.
