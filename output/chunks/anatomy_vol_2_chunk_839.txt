Hemopoiesis begins when the hemopoietic stem cell is exposed to appropriate chemical stimuli collectively called
hemopoietic growth factors, which prompt it to divide and differentiate. One daughter cell remains a hemopoietic stem
cell, allowing hemopoiesis to continue. The other daughter cell becomes either of two types of more specialized stem cells
(Figure 18.4):

Â¢ Lymphoid stem cells give rise to a class of leukocytes known as lymphocytes, which include the various T cells,

B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, all of which function in immunity. However, hemopoiesis of lymphocytes

progresses somewhat differently from the process for the other formed elements. In brief, lymphoid stem cells quickly

migrate from the bone marrow to lymphatic tissues, including the lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus, where their
production and differentiation continues. B cells are so named since they mature in the bone marrow, while T cells
mature in the thymus.
