Finally, physical exertion stimulates proprioceptors, which are receptors located within the muscles,
joints, and tendons, which sense movement and stretching; proprioceptors thus create a stimulus that may also trigger
the respiratory centers of the brain. These neural factors are consistent with the sudden increase in ventilation that is
observed immediately as exercise begins. Because the respiratory centers are stimulated by psychological, motor neuron,
and proprioceptor inputs throughout exercise, the fact that there is also a sudden decrease in ventilation immediately after
the exercise ends when these neural stimuli cease, further supports the idea that they are involved in triggering the changes
of ventilation.

 High Altitude Effects

An increase in altitude results in a decrease in atmospheric pressure. Although the proportion of oxygen relative to gases in
the atmosphere remains at 21 percent, its partial pressure decreases (Table 22.4). As a result, it is more difficult for a body to
achieve the same level of oxygen saturation at high altitude than at low altitude, due to lower atmospheric pressure.
