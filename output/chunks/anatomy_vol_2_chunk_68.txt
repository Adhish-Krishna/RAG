Today, research into nervous tissue has shown that there are
many deeper roles that these cells play. And research may find much more about them in the future.

 There are six types of glial cells. Four of them are found in the CNS and two are found in the PNS. Table 12.2 outlines
some common characteristics and functions.

Glial Cells of the CNS

One cell providing support to neurons of the CNS is the astrocyte, so named because it appears to be star-shaped under the
microscope (astro- =
