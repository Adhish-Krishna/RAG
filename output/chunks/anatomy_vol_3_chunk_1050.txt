These enzymes are activated
in the duodenum. 48 The hepatocytes are the main cell type of the liver. They process, store, and release nutrients into the blood.
 Radiating out from the central vein, they are tightly packed around the hepatic sinusoids, allowing the hepatocytes easy access to
the blood flowing through the sinusoids. 49 Bile salts and lecithin can emulsify large lipid globules because they are amphipathic;
they have a nonpolar (hydrophobic) region that attaches to the large fat molecules as well as a polar (hydrophilic) region that
interacts with the watery chime in the intestine. 50 Intrinsic factor secreted in the stomach binds to the large B12 compound,
creating a combination that can bind to mucosal receptors in the ileum.
