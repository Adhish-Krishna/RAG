Although blood cells are not exchanged, the chorionic villi provide ample surface area for the two-way exchange
of substances between maternal and fetal blood. The rate of exchange increases throughout gestation as the villi become
thinner and increasingly branched. The placenta is permeable to lipid-soluble fetotoxic substances: alcohol, nicotine,
barbiturates, antibiotics, certain pathogens, and many other substances that can be dangerous or fatal to the developing
embryo or fetus. For these reasons, pregnant women should avoid fetotoxic substances. Alcohol consumption by pregnant
women, for example, can result in a range of abnormalities referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). These
include organ and facial malformations, as well as cognitive and behavioral disorders.
