Parkinson’s disease is linked to an increase in a protein known as alpha-synuclein that is toxic to the cells of
the substantia nigra nucleus in the midbrain.

 For proteins to function correctly, they are dependent on their three-dimensional shape. The linear sequence of
amino acids folds into a three-dimensional shape that is based on the interactions between and among those amino
acids. When the folding is disturbed, and proteins take on a different shape, they stop functioning correctly. But the
disease is not necessarily the result of functional loss of these proteins; rather, these altered proteins start to accumulate
and may become toxic. For example, in Alzheimer’s, the hallmark of the disease is the accumulation of these amyloid
plaques in the cerebral cortex. The term coined to describe this sort of disease is “proteopathy” and it includes other
diseases. Creutzfeld-Jacob disease, the human variant of the prion disease known as mad cow disease in the bovine,
also involves the accumulation of amyloid plaques, similar to Alzheimer’s.
