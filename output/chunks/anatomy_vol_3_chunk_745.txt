Depending on the individual, these
symptoms can be entirely absent, moderate, or severe.

 After menopause, lower amounts of estrogens can lead to other changes. Cardiovascular disease becomes as

prevalent in women as in men, possibly because estrogens reduce the amount of cholesterol in the blood vessels. When
estrogen is lacking, many women find that they suddenly have problems with high cholesterol and the cardiovascular
issues that accompany it. Osteoporosis is another problem because bone density decreases rapidly in the first years
after menopause. The reduction in bone density leads to a higher incidence of fractures.
 Hormone therapy (HT), which employs medication (synthetic estrogens and progestins) to increase estrogen and
progestin levels, can alleviate some of the symptoms of menopause. In 2002, the Womenâ€™s Health Initiative began a
study to observe women for the long-term outcomes of hormone replacement therapy over 8.5 years.
