The vertebrae are divided into three regions: cervical C1—-C7 vertebrae, thoracic T1-T12 vertebrae, and lumbar L1-L5
vertebrae. The vertebral column is curved, with two primary curvatures (thoracic and sacrococcygeal curves) and two
secondary curvatures (cervical and lumbar curves).

 Regions of the Vertebral Column

The vertebral column originally develops as a series of 33 vertebrae, but this number is eventually reduced to 24 vertebrae,
plus the sacrum and coccyx. The vertebral column is subdivided into five regions, with the vertebrae in each area named for
that region and numbered in descending order. In the neck, there are seven cervical vertebrae, each designated with the letter
“C” followed by its number. Superiorly, the C1 vertebra articulates (forms a joint) with the occipital condyles of the skull.
 Inferiorly, C1 articulates with the C2 vertebra, and so on. Below these are the 12 thoracic vertebrae, designated T1-T12.
