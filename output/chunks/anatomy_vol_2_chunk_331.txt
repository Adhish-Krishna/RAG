The basilar membrane is the thin membrane that extends from the central
core of the cochlea to the edge. What is anchored to this membrane so that they can be activated by movement of the
fluids within the cochlea?

As stated above, a given region of the basilar membrane will only move if the incoming sound is at a specific
frequency. Because the tectorial membrane only moves where the basilar membrane moves, the hair cells in this region
will also only respond to sounds of this specific frequency. Therefore, as the frequency of a sound changes, different hair
cells are activated all along the basilar membrane. The cochlea encodes auditory stimuli for frequencies between 20 and
20,000 Hz, which is the range of sound that human ears can detect. The unit of Hertz measures the frequency of sound
waves in terms of cycles produced per second. Frequencies as low as 20 Hz are detected by hair cells at the apex, or tip, of
the cochlea.
