Inferiorly, the talus articulates with the calcaneus (heel bone), the largest bone of the foot, which
forms the heel. Body weight is transferred from the tibia to the talus to the calcaneus, which rests on the ground. The medial
calcaneus has a prominent bony extension called the sustentaculum tali (“support for the talus”) that supports the medial
side of the talus bone.
