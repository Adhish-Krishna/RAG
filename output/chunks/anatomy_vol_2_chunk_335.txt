The stereocilia of the hair cells extend into a viscous gel called the otolith (Figure 14.11).
 The otolith contains calcium carbonate crystals, making it denser and giving it greater inertia than the macula. Therefore,
gravity will cause the otolith to move separately from the macula in response to head movements. Tilting the head causes
the otolith to slide over the macula in the direction of gravity. The moving otolith layer, in turn, bends the sterocilia to cause
some hair cells to depolarize as others hyperpolarize. The exact tilt of the head is interpreted by the brain on the basis of the
pattern of hair-cell depolarization.
