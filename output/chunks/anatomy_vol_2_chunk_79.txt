A single Schwann cell insulates a segment of a peripheral nerve, whereas in the CNS,
an oligodendrocyte may provide insulation for a few separate axon segments. EM x 1,460,000. (Micrograph provided

Several diseases can result from the demyelination of axons. The causes of these diseases are not the same; some have
genetic causes, some are caused by pathogens, and others are the result of autoimmune disorders. Though the causes
are varied, the results are largely similar. The myelin insulation of axons is compromised, making electrical signaling
slower.

 Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one such disease. It is an example of an autoimmune disease. The antibodies produced
by lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) mark myelin as something that should not be in the body.
