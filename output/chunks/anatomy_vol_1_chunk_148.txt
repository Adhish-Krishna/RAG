An atom that has an electrical
charge—whether positive or negative—is an ion.

repulsion of charges. What happens to the charged electroscope when a conductor is moved between its plastic sheets,
and why?

Potassium (K), for instance, is an important element in all body cells. Its atomic number is 19. It has just one electron
in its valence shell. This characteristic makes potassium highly likely to participate in chemical reactions in which it donates
one electron. (It is easier for potassium to donate one electron than to gain seven electrons.) The loss will cause the positive
charge of potassium’s protons to be more influential than the negative charge of potassium’s electrons. In other words, the
resulting potassium ion will be slightly positive. A potassium ion is written K’, indicating that it has lost a single electron.
