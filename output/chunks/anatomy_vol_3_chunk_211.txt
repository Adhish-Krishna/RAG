The laryngeal muscles also constrict to prevent aspiration of
food into the trachea. At this point, deglutition apnea takes place, which means that breathing ceases for a very brief time.
 Contractions of the pharyngeal constrictor muscles move the bolus through the oropharynx and laryngopharynx. Relaxation
of the upper esophageal sphincter then allows food to enter the esophagus.


1040 CHAPTER 23 | THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM

The Esophageal Phase

The entry of food into the esophagus marks the beginning of the esophageal phase of deglutition and the initiation of
peristalsis. As in the previous phase, the complex neuromuscular actions are controlled by the medulla oblongata. Peristalsis
propels the bolus through the esophagus and toward the stomach. The circular muscle layer of the muscularis contracts,
pinching the esophageal wall and forcing the bolus forward. At the same time, the longitudinal muscle layer of the
muscularis also contracts, shortening this area and pushing out its walls to receive the bolus.
