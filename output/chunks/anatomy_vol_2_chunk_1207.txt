Powerful generalized n/a
vasoconstrictor; also stimulates
release of aldosterone and ADH
ANH (peptide) na Powerful generalized vasodilator;
also promotes loss of fluid volume
from kidneys, hence reducing
blood volume, pressure, and flow
ADH Moderately strong generalized n/a
vasoconstrictor; also causes body
to retain more fluid via kidneys,
increasing blood volume and pressure
Other factors | Decreasing levels of oxygen Vasodilation, also opens
precapillary sphincters
Increasing levels of potassium
fon

Increasing levels of NO

Increasing levels of lactic acid
and other metabolites
Increasing levels of endothelins

Increasing levels of platelet
secretions

Increasing hyperthermia
Stretching of vascular wall
(myogenic)

Increasing levels of histamines
from basophils and mast cells

Effect of Exercise on Vascular Homeostasis

The heart is a muscle and, like any muscle, it responds dramatically to exercise.
