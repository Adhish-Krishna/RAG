A region higher in solute concentration (and
lower in water concentration) draws water across a semipermeable membrane from a region higher in water concentration
(and lower in solute concentration).

 As we discuss osmotic pressure in blood and tissue fluid, it is important to recognize that the formed elements of blood
do not contribute to osmotic concentration gradients. Rather, it is the plasma proteins that play the key role. Solutes also
move across the capillary wall according to their concentration gradient, but overall, the concentrations should be similar
and not have a significant impact on osmosis. Because of their large size and chemical structure, plasma proteins are not
truly solutes, that is, they do not dissolve but are dispersed or suspended in their fluid medium, forming a colloid rather than
a solution.
