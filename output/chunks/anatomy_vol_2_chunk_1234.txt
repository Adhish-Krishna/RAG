Like their counterparts
in the aortic sinuses, the information provided by these receptors is critical to maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis (see
Figure 20.23).

 The internal carotid arteries along with the vertebral arteries are the two primary suppliers of blood to the human
brain. Given the central role and vital importance of the brain to life, it is critical that blood supply to this organ remains
uninterrupted. Recall that blood flow to the brain is remarkably constant, with approximately 20 percent of blood flow
directed to this organ at any given time. When blood flow is interrupted, even for just a few seconds, a transient ischemic
attack (TIA), or mini-stroke, may occur, resulting in loss of consciousness or temporary loss of neurological function. In
some cases, the damage may be permanent. Loss of blood flow for longer periods, typically between 3 and 4 minutes,
will likely produce irreversible brain damage or a stroke, also called a cerebrovascular accident (CVA).
