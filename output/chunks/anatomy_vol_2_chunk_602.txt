Figure 16.8 Pituitary Tumor The pituitary gland is located in the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone within the cranial
floor, placing it immediately inferior to the optic chiasm. If the pituitary gland develops a tumor, it can press against the
fibers crossing in the chiasm. Those fibers are conveying peripheral visual information to the opposite side of the brain,
so the patient will experience “tunnel vision’—meaning that only the central visual field will be perceived.

 The vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) carries both equilibrium and auditory sensations from the inner ear to the
medulla. Though the two senses are not directly related, anatomy is mirrored in the two systems. Problems with balance,
such as vertigo, and deficits in hearing may both point to problems with the inner ear.
