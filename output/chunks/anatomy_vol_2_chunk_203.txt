This input is to the striatum, or the caudate and putamen. In
the direct pathway, the striatum projects to the internal segment of the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra pars
reticulata (GPi/SNr). This is an inhibitory pathway, in which GABA is released at the synapse, and the target cells
are hyperpolarized and less likely to fire. The output from the basal nuclei is to the thalamus, which is an inhibitory
projection using GABA.

 The switch between the two pathways is the substantia nigra pars compacta, which projects to the striatum and
releases the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine receptors are either excitatory (D1-type receptors) or inhibitory (D2-type
receptors). The direct pathway is activated by dopamine, and the indirect pathway is inhibited by dopamine. When the
substantia nigra pars compacta is firing, it signals to the basal nuclei that the body is in an active state, and movement will
be more likely.
