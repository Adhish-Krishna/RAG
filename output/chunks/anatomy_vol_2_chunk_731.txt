These proteins enhance cellular proliferation and inhibit apoptosis, or
programmed cell death. IGFs stimulate cells to increase their uptake of amino acids from the blood for protein synthesis.
 Skeletal muscle and cartilage cells are particularly sensitive to stimulation from IGFs.

 Dysfunction of the endocrine system’s control of growth can result in several disorders. For example, gigantism is
a disorder in children that is caused by the secretion of abnormally large amounts of GH, resulting in excessive growth.
 A similar condition in adults is acromegaly, a disorder that results in the growth of bones in the face, hands, and feet in
response to excessive levels of GH in individuals who have stopped growing. Abnormally low levels of GH in children can
cause growth impairment—a disorder called pituitary dwarfism (also known as growth hormone deficiency).

 Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone

The activity of the thyroid gland is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), also called thyrotropin.
