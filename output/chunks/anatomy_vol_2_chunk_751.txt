 Ty r

The parathyroid glands produce and secrete PTH, a peptide hormone, in response to low blood calcium levels (Figure
17.16). PTH secretion causes the release of calcium from the bones by stimulating osteoclasts, which secrete enzymes
that degrade bone and release calcium into the interstitial fluid. PTH also inhibits osteoblasts, the cells involved in bone
deposition, thereby sparing blood calcium. PTH causes increased reabsorption of calcium (and magnesium) in the kidney
tubules from the urine filtrate.
