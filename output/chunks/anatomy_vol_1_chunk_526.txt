 Injuries

Because the skin is the part of our bodies that meets the world most directly, it is especially vulnerable to injury. Injuries
include burns and wounds, as well as scars and calluses. They can be caused by sharp objects, heat, or excessive pressure
or friction to the skin.

 Skin injuries set off a healing process that occurs in several overlapping stages. The first step to repairing damaged
skin is the formation of a blood clot that helps stop the flow of blood and scabs over with time. Many different types of
cells are involved in wound repair, especially if the surface area that needs repair is extensive. Before the basal stem cells
of the stratum basale can recreate the epidermis, fibroblasts mobilize and divide rapidly to repair the damaged tissue by
collagen deposition, forming granulation tissue.
