Local intercellular communication is the province of the paracrine, also called a paracrine factor, which is a chemical
that induces a response in neighboring cells. Although paracrines may enter the bloodstream, their concentration is generally
too low to elicit a response from distant tissues. A familiar example to those with asthma is histamine, a paracrine that
is released by immune cells in the bronchial tree. Histamine causes the smooth muscle cells of the bronchi to constrict,
narrowing the airways. Another example is the neurotransmitters of the nervous system, which act only locally within the
synaptic cleft.
