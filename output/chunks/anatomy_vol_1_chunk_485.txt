Fat distribution changes as our bodies mature and age.
 Men tend to accumulate fat in different areas (neck, arms, lower back, and abdomen) than do women (breasts, hips,
thighs, and buttocks). The body mass index (BMI) is often used as a measure of fat, although this measure is, in fact,
derived from a mathematical formula that compares body weight (mass) to height. Therefore, its accuracy as a health
indicator can be called into question in individuals who are extremely physically fit.

 In many animals, there is a pattern of storing excess calories as fat to be used in times when food is not
readily available. In much of the developed world, insufficient exercise coupled with the ready availability and
consumption of high-calorie foods have resulted in unwanted accumulations of adipose tissue in many people.
