Figure 11.29 Hip and Thigh Muscles The large and powerful muscles of the hip that move the femur generally
originate on the pelvic girdle and insert into the femur. The muscles that move the lower leg typically originate on the
femur and insert into the bones of the knee joint. The anterior muscles of the femur extend the lower leg but also
aid in flexing the thigh. The posterior muscles of the femur flex the lower leg but also aid in extending the thigh. A
combination of gluteal and thigh muscles also adduct, abduct, and rotate the thigh and lower leg.
