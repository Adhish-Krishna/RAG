Whereas the basic circuit is a reflex arc, there are differences in the structure of
those reflexes for the somatic and autonomic systems.

 The Structure of Reflexes

One difference between a somatic reflex, such as the withdrawal reflex, and a visceral reflex, which is an autonomic reflex,
is in the efferent branch. The output of a somatic reflex is the lower motor neuron in the ventral horn of the spinal cord
that projects directly to a skeletal muscle to cause its contraction. The output of a visceral reflex is a two-step pathway
starting with the preganglionic fiber emerging from a lateral horn neuron in the spinal cord, or a cranial nucleus neuron in
the brain stem, to a ganglionâ€”followed by the postganglionic fiber projecting to a target effector.
