In contrast, the
ICF has elevated amounts of potassium, phosphate, magnesium, and protein. Overall, the ICF contains high concentrations

of potassium and phosphate (HPO? ~ ), whereas both plasma and the ECF contain high concentrations of sodium and

chloride.

Figure 26.5 The Concentrations of Different Elements in Key Bodily Fluids The graph shows the composition of
the ICF, IF, and plasma. The compositions of plasma and IF are similar to one another but are quite different from the

composition of the ICF.
