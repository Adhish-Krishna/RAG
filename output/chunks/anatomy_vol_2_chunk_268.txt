The nerves in the periphery are
not straight continuations of the spinal nerves, but rather the reorganization of the axons in those nerves to follow different
courses. Axons from different spinal nerves will come together into a systemic nerve. This occurs at four places along
the length of the vertebral column, each identified as a nerve plexus, whereas the other spinal nerves directly correspond
to nerves at their respective levels. In this instance, the word plexus is used to describe networks of nerve fibers with no
associated cell bodies.

 Of the four nerve plexuses, two are found at the cervical level, one at the lumbar level, and one at the sacral level
(Figure 13.24). The cervical plexus is composed of axons from spinal nerves C1 through C5 and branches into nerves
in the posterior neck and head, as well as the phrenic nerve, which connects to the diaphragm at the base of the thoracic
cavity.
