The trial showed that the drug was not effective at treating
heart conditions, but many men experienced erection and priapism (erection lasting longer than 4 hours). Because of
this, a clinical trial was started to investigate the ability of sildenafil to promote erections in men suffering from ED.
 In 1998, the FDA approved the drug, marketed as Viagra®. Since approval of the drug, sildenafil and similar PDE
inhibitors now generate over a billion dollars a year in sales, and are reported to be effective in treating approximately
70 to 85 percent of cases of ED. Importantly, men with health problems—especially those with cardiac disease taking
nitrates—should avoid Viagra or talk to their physician to find out if they are a candidate for the use of this drug, as
deaths have been reported for at-risk users.
