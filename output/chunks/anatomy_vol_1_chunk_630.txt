Each bone of the body serves a particular function, and therefore bones vary in size, shape, and strength based on
these functions. For example, the bones of the lower back and lower limb are thick and strong to support your body weight.
 Similarly, the size of a bony landmark that serves as a muscle attachment site on an individual bone is related to the strength
of this muscle. Muscles can apply very strong pulling forces to the bones of the skeleton. To resist these forces, bones have
enlarged bony landmarks at sites where powerful muscles attach. This means that not only the size of a bone, but also its
shape, is related to its function. For this reason, the identification of bony landmarks is important during your study of the
skeletal system.

 Bones are also dynamic organs that can modify their strength and thickness in response to changes in muscle strength
or body weight.
