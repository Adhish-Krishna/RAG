Overall height decreases as the
bones lose calcium and other minerals. With age, fluid decreases in the fibrous cartilage disks intercalated between the
vertebrae in the spine. Joints lose cartilage and stiffen. Many tissues, including those in muscles, lose mass through a
process called atrophy. Lumps and rigidity become more widespread. As a consequence, the passageways, blood vessels,
and airways become more rigid. The brain and spinal cord lose mass. Nerves do not transmit impulses with the same speed
and frequency as in the past. Some loss of thought clarity and memory can accompany aging. More severe problems are not
necessarily associated with the aging process and may be symptoms of underlying illness.

 As exterior signs of aging increase, so do the interior signs, which are not as noticeable. The incidence of heart diseases,
respiratory syndromes, and type 2 diabetes increases with age, though these are not necessarily age-dependent effects.
