causing shortness of breath, or dyspnea. During the last several weeks of pregnancy, the pelvis becomes more elastic, and
the fetus descends lower in a process called lightening. This typically ameliorates dyspnea.

 The respiratory mucosa swell in response to increased blood flow during pregnancy, leading to nasal congestion and
nose bleeds, particularly when the weather is cold and dry. Humidifier use and increased fluid intake are often recommended
to counteract congestion.

 Integumentary System Changes

The dermis stretches extensively to accommodate the growing uterus, breast tissue, and fat deposits on the thighs and hips.
 Torn connective tissue beneath the dermis can cause striae (stretch marks) on the abdomen, which appear as red or purple
marks during pregnancy that fade to a silvery white color in the months after childbirth.
