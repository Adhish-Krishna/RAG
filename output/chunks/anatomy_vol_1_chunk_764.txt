The scapula (shoulder blade) lies on the posterior aspect of the shoulder. It is supported by the clavicle, which also
articulates with the humerus (arm bone) to form the shoulder joint. The scapula is a flat, triangular-shaped bone with a
prominent ridge running across its posterior surface. This ridge extends out laterally, where it forms the bony tip of the
shoulder and joins with the lateral end of the clavicle. By following along the clavicle, you can palpate out to the bony tip
of the shoulder, and from there, you can move back across your posterior shoulder to follow the ridge of the scapula. Move
your shoulder around and feel how the clavicle and scapula move together as a unit. Both of these bones serve as important
attachment sites for muscles that aid with movements of the shoulder and arm.

 The right and left pectoral girdles are not joined to each other, allowing each to operate independently.
