The overall drainage system of the body is asymmetrical (see Figure 21.4). The right lymphatic duct receives lymph
from only the upper right side of the body. The lymph from the rest of the body enters the bloodstream through the thoracic
duct via all the remaining lymphatic trunks. In general, lymphatic vessels of the subcutaneous tissues of the skin, that is, the
superficial lymphatics, follow the same routes as veins, whereas the deep lymphatic vessels of the viscera generally follow
the paths of arteries.

 The Organization of Immune Function

The immune system is a collection of barriers, cells, and soluble proteins that interact and communicate with each other in
extraordinarily complex ways. The modern model of immune function is organized into three phases based on the timing of
their effects. The three temporal phases consist of the following:
¢ Barrier defenses such as the skin and mucous membranes, which act instantaneously to prevent pathogenic invasion
into the body tissues
¢
