The Thyroid Gland

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Describe the location and anatomy of the thyroid gland
* Discuss the synthesis of triiodothyronine and thyroxine
¢ Explain the role of thyroid hormones in the regulation of basal metabolism
¢ Identify the hormone produced by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid

A butterfly-shaped organ, the thyroid gland is located anterior to the trachea, just inferior to the larynx (Figure 17.12). The
medial region, called the isthmus, is flanked by wing-shaped left and right lobes. Each of the thyroid lobes are embedded
with parathyroid glands, primarily on their posterior surfaces. The tissue of the thyroid gland is composed mostly of thyroid
follicles. The follicles are made up of a central cavity filled with a sticky fluid called colloid. Surrounded by a wall of
epithelial follicle cells, the colloid is the center of thyroid hormone production, and that production is dependent on the
hormones’ essential and unique component: iodine.
