Testosterone

Testosterone, an androgen, is a steroid hormone produced by Leydig cells. The alternate term for Leydig cells, interstitial
cells, reflects their location between the seminiferous tubules in the testes. In male embryos, testosterone is secreted
by Leydig cells by the seventh week of development, with peak concentrations reached in the second trimester. This
early release of testosterone results in the anatomical differentiation of the male sexual organs. In childhood, testosterone
concentrations are low. They increase during puberty, activating characteristic physical changes and initiating
spermatogenesis.

Functions of Testosterone

The continued presence of testosterone is necessary to keep the male reproductive system working properly, and Leydig
cells produce approximately 6 to 7 mg of testosterone per day. Testicular steroidogenesis (the manufacture of androgens,
including testosterone) results in testosterone concentrations that are 100 times higher in the testes than in the circulation.
