Excessive exposure to radioactive isotopes can damage human cells and even cause cancer and
birth defects, but when exposure is controlled, some radioactive isotopes can be useful in medicine. For more information,

Interventional Radiologist

The controlled use of radioisotopes has advanced medical diagnosis and treatment of disease. Interventional
radiologists are physicians who treat disease by using minimally invasive techniques involving radiation. Many
conditions that could once only be treated with a lengthy and traumatic operation can now be treated non-surgically,
reducing the cost, pain, length of hospital stay, and recovery time for patients. For example, in the past, the only options
for a patient with one or more tumors in the liver were surgery and chemotherapy (the administration of drugs to treat
cancer).
