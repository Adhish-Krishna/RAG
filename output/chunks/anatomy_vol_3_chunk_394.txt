In response to a drop in blood glucose concentration, the hormone glucagon is released from the alpha cells of the
pancreas. Glucagon acts upon the liver cells, where it inhibits the synthesis of glycogen and stimulates the breakdown of

stored glycogen back into glucose. This glucose is released from the liver to be used by the peripheral tissues and the brain.
 As a result, blood glucose levels begin to rise. Gluconeogenesis will also begin in the liver to replace the glucose that has
been used by the peripheral tissues.

 After ingestion of food, fats and proteins are processed as described previously; however, the glucose processing
changes a bit. The peripheral tissues preferentially absorb glucose. The liver, which normally absorbs and processes glucose,
will not do so after a prolonged fast. The gluconeogenesis that has been ongoing in the liver will continue after fasting to
replace the glycogen stores that were depleted in the liver.
