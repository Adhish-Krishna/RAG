Without these stimuli, the Miillerian duct will develop and the Wolffian duct
will degrade, resulting in a female embryo. 31 If the SRY gene were not functional, the XY individual would be genetically a
male, but would develop female reproductive structures.

1 The first structure shown is the morula. The blastocoel appears at approximately 20 seconds. The movie ends with the hatching
of the conceptus. 2 Neurulation starts in week 4. 3 A regular heartbeat can be detected at approximately 8 weeks. 4C 5A 6

makes the sperm membrane more fragile. This enables it to release its digestive enzymes during the acrosomal reaction. When
capacitation is inadequate, sperm cannot reach the oocyte membrane. 33 Sherriseâ€™s concern is valid. Sperm may be viable for
up to 4 days; therefore, it is entirely possible that capacitated sperm are still residing in her uterine tubes and could fertilize the
oocyte she has just ovulated.
