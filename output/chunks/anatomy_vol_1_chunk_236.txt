Molecules with polar
covalent bonds have “poles”—regions of weakly positive and negative charge—and have a triangular three-dimensional
shape. An atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen form water molecules by means of polar covalent bonds. Hydrogen
bonds link hydrogen atoms already participating in polar covalent bonds to anions or electronegative regions of other polar
molecules. Hydrogen bonds link water molecules, resulting in the properties of water that are important to living things.

2.3 Chemical Reactions

Chemical reactions, in which chemical bonds are broken and formed, require an initial investment of energy. Kinetic energy,
the energy of matter in motion, fuels the collisions of atoms, ions, and molecules that are necessary if their old bonds are to
break and new ones to form. All molecules store potential energy, which is released when their bonds are broken.

 Four forms of energy essential to human functioning are: chemical energy, which is stored and released as chemical
bonds are formed and broken; mechanical energy, which directly powers physical activity; radiant energy, emitted as waves
such as in sunlight; and electrical energy, the power of moving electrons.
