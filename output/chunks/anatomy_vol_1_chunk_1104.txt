Skeletal muscle fibers are long, multinucleated cells. The membrane of the cell is the sarcolemma; the cytoplasm of the
cell is the sarcoplasm. The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is a form of endoplasmic reticulum. Muscle fibers are composed of
myofibrils. The striations are created by the organization of actin and myosin resulting in the banding pattern of myofibrils.

 10.3 Muscle Fiber Contraction and Relaxation

A sarcomere is the smallest contractile portion of a muscle. Myofibrils are composed of thick and thin filaments. Thick
filaments are composed of the protein myosin; thin filaments are composed of the protein actin. Troponin and tropomyosin
are regulatory proteins.

 Muscle contraction is described by the sliding filament model of contraction. ACh is the neurotransmitter that binds at
the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) to trigger depolarization, and an action potential travels along the sarcolemma to trigger

calcium release from SR.
