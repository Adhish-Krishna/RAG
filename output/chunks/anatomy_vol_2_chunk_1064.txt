Elevated rates in an exercising or resting patient are
normal and expected. Resting rate should always be taken after recovery from exercise. Treatment depends upon the
underlying cause but may include medications, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, ablation, or surgery.

 Correlation Between Heart Rates and Cardiac Output

Initially, physiological conditions that cause HR to increase also trigger an increase in SV. During exercise, the rate of blood
returning to the heart increases. However as the HR rises, there is less time spent in diastole and consequently less time
or the ventricles to fill with blood. Even though there is less filling time, SV will initially remain high. However, as HR
continues to increase, SV gradually decreases due to decreased filling time. CO will initially stabilize as the increasing HR
compensates for the decreasing SV, but at very high rates, CO will eventually decrease as increasing rates are no longer able
to compensate for the decreasing SV.
