The function of respiration
is to provide oxygen for use by body cells during cellular respiration and to eliminate carbon dioxide, a waste product of
cellular respiration, from the body. In order for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide to occur, both gases must be
transported between the external and internal respiration sites. Although carbon dioxide is more soluble than oxygen in
blood, both gases require a specialized transport system for the majority of the gas molecules to be moved between the
lungs and other tissues.

 Oxygen Transport in the Blood

Even though oxygen is transported via the blood, you may recall that oxygen is not very soluble in liquids. A small amount
of oxygen does dissolve in the blood and is transported in the bloodstream, but it is only about 1.5% of the total amount. The
majority of oxygen molecules are carried from the lungs to the body’s tissues by a specialized transport system, which relies
on the erythrocyte—the red blood cell.
