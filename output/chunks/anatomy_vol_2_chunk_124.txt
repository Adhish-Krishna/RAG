Some types of stimuli cause depolarization of the
membrane, whereas others cause hyperpolarization. It depends on the specific ion channels that are activated in the
cell membrane.

 Types of Graded Potentials

For the unipolar cells of sensory neurons—both those with free nerve endings and those within encapsulations—graded
potentials develop in the dendrites that influence the generation of an action potential in the axon of the same cell. This
is called a generator potential. For other sensory receptor cells, such as taste cells or photoreceptors of the retina, graded
potentials in their membranes result in the release of neurotransmitters at synapses with sensory neurons. This is called a
receptor potential.

 A postsynaptic potential (PSP) is the graded potential in the dendrites of a neuron that is receiving synapses from
other cells. Postsynaptic potentials can be depolarizing or hyperpolarizing. Depolarization in a postsynaptic potential is
called an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) because it causes the membrane potential to move toward threshold.
