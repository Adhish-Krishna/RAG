Steps 1 and 2 of bicarbonate conservation are indicated.

 It is also possible that salts in the filtrate, such as sulfates, phosphates, or ammonia, will capture hydrogen ions. If
this occurs, the hydrogen ions will not be available to combine with bicarbonate ions and produce COz. In such cases,
bicarbonate ions are not conserved from the filtrate to the blood, which will also contribute to a pH imbalance and acidosis.

 The hydrogen ions also compete with potassium to exchange with sodium in the renal tubules. If more potassium
is present than normal, potassium, rather than the hydrogen ions, will be exchanged, and increased potassium enters the
filtrate. When this occurs, fewer hydrogen ions in the filtrate participate in the conversion of bicarbonate into CO2 and less
bicarbonate is conserved. If there is less potassium, more hydrogen ions enter the filtrate to be exchanged with sodium and
more bicarbonate is conserved.
