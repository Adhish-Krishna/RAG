Structurally, ATP molecules consist of an adenine, a ribose, and three phosphate groups (Figure 24.2). The chemical
bond between the second and third phosphate groups, termed a high-energy bond, represents the greatest source of energy
in a cell. It is the first bond that catabolic enzymes break when cells require energy to do work. The products of this reaction
are a molecule of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and a lone phosphate group (Pj). ATP, ADP, and Pj are constantly being
cycled through reactions that build ATP and store energy, and reactions that break down ATP and release energy.
