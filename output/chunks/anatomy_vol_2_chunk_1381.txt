T Cell Development and Differentiation

The process of eliminating T cells that might attack the cells of one’s own body is referred to as T cell tolerance. While
thymocytes are in the cortex of the thymus, they are referred to as “double negatives,” meaning that they do not bear the
CD4 or CD8 molecules that you can use to follow their pathways of differentiation (Figure 21.18).
