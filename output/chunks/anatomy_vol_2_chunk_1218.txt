Treatments depend upon the underlying cause and, in addition to administering
fluids intravenously, often include the administration of anticoagulants, removal of fluid from the pericardial cavity,
or air from the thoracic cavity, and surgery as required. The most common cause is a pulmonary embolism, a clot that
lodges in the pulmonary vessels and interrupts blood flow. Other causes include stenosis of the aortic valve; cardiac
tamponade, in which excess fluid in the pericardial cavity interferes with the ability of the heart to fully relax and fill
with blood (resulting in decreased preload); and a pneumothorax, in which an excessive amount of air is present in the

thoracic cavity, outside of the lungs, which interferes with venous return, pulmonary function, and delivery of oxygen
to the tissues.

20.5 | Circulatory Pathways

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
Â¢ Identify the vessels through which blood travels within the pulmonary circuit, beginning from the right ventricle of
the heart and ending at the left atrium
* Create a flow chart showing the major systemic arteries through which blood travels from the aorta and its major
branches, to the most significant arteries feeding into the right and left upper and lower limbs
* Create a flow chart showing the major systemic veins through which blood travels from the feet to the right atrium
of the heart

Virtually every cell, tissue, organ, and system in the body is impacted by the circulatory system.
