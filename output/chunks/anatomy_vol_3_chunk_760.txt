The fluid continues through the
prostatic urethra, where secretions from the prostate are added to form semen. These secretions help the sperm to travel
through the urethra and into the female reproductive tract. Secretions from the bulbourethral glands protect sperm and
cleanse and lubricate the penile (spongy) urethra.
 The penis is the male organ of copulation. Columns of erectile tissue called the corpora cavernosa and corpus
pongiosum fill with blood when sexual arousal activates vasodilatation in the blood vessels of the penis. Testosterone
regulates and maintains the sex organs and sex drive, and induces the physical changes of puberty. Interplay between the
testes and the endocrine system precisely control the production of testosterone with a negative feedback loop.

27.2 Anatomy and Physiology of the Female Reproductive System

The external female genitalia are collectively called the vulva. The vagina is the pathway into and out of the uterus. The
manâ€™s penis is inserted into the vagina to deliver sperm, and the baby exits the uterus through the vagina during childbirth.
