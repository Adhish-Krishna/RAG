Since blood passes through the larger vessels relatively
quickly, there is limited opportunity for blood in the lumen of the vessel to provide nourishment to or remove waste from the
vessel’s cells. Further, the walls of the larger vessels are too thick for nutrients to diffuse through to all of the cells. Larger
arteries and veins contain small blood vessels within their walls known as the vasa vasorum—literally “vessels of the
vessel”—to provide them with this critical exchange. Since the pressure within arteries is relatively high, the vasa vasorum
must function in the outer layers of the vessel (see Figure 20.3) or the pressure exerted by the blood passing through the
vessel would collapse it, preventing any exchange from occurring. The lower pressure within veins allows the vasa vasorum
to be located closer to the lumen. The restriction of the vasa vasorum to the outer layers of arteries is thought to be one
reason that arterial diseases are more common than venous diseases, since its location makes it more difficult to nourish the
cells of the arteries and remove waste products.
