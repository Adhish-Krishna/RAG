The periosteum contains blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatic vessels that
nourish compact bone. Tendons and ligaments also attach to bones at the periosteum. The periosteum covers the entire outer
surface except where the epiphyses meet other bones to form joints (Figure 6.8). In this region, the epiphyses are covered
with articular cartilage, a thin layer of cartilage that reduces friction and acts as a shock absorber.
