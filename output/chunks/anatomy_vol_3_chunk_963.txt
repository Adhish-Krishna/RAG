clavicle extends laterally across the anterior shoulder and can be palpated along its entire length. At its lateral end, the clavicle
articulates with the acromion of the scapula, which forms the bony tip of the shoulder. The acromion is continuous with the spine
of the scapula, which can be palpated medially and posteriorly along its length. Together, the clavicle, acromion, and spine of the
scapula form a V-shaped line that serves as an important area for muscle attachment. 34 A blow to the shoulder or falling onto
an outstretched hand passes strong forces through the scapula to the clavicle and sternum. A hard fall may thus cause a fracture of
the clavicle (broken collarbone) or may injure the ligaments of the acromioclavicular joint. In a severe case, the coracoclavicular
ligament may also rupture, resulting in complete dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint (a “shoulder separation”).
