Moreover, iodine deficiency is the primary cause
of preventable mental retardation worldwide. Neonatal hypothyroidism (cretinism) is characterized by cognitive
deficits, short stature, and sometimes deafness and muteness in children and adults born to mothers who were iodine-
deficient during pregnancy.

 In areas of the world with access to iodized salt, dietary deficiency is rare. Instead, inflammation of the thyroid
gland is the more common cause of low blood levels of thyroid hormones. Called hypothyroidism, the condition
is characterized by a low metabolic rate, weight gain, cold extremities, constipation, reduced libido, menstrual
irregularities, and reduced mental activity. In contrast, hyperthyroidism—an abnormally elevated blood level of
thyroid hormones—is often caused by a pituitary or thyroid tumor. In Graves’ disease, the hyperthyroid state results
from an autoimmune reaction in which antibodies overstimulate the follicle cells of the thyroid gland.
