The anterior and posterior surfaces of the sacrum have a series of paired openings called sacral foramina
(singular = foramen) that connect to the sacral canal. Each of these openings is called a posterior (dorsal) sacral foramen
or anterior (ventral) sacral foramen. These openings allow for the anterior and posterior branches of the sacral spinal
nerves to exit the sacrum. The superior articular process of the sacrum, one of which is found on either side of the
superior opening of the sacral canal, articulates with the inferior articular processes from the L5 vertebra.

 The coccyx, or tailbone, is derived from the fusion of four very small coccygeal vertebrae (see Figure 7.29). It
articulates with the inferior tip of the sacrum. It is not weight bearing in the standing position, but may receive some body
weight when sitting.

are indicated by the transverse ridges.
