Antigens from different classes of pathogens,
however, use different MHC classes and take different routes through the cell to get to the surface for presentation. The
basic mechanism, though, is the same. Antigens are processed by digestion, are brought into the endomembrane system of
the cell, and then are expressed on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell for antigen recognition by a T cell. Intracellular
antigens are typical of viruses, which replicate inside the cell, and certain other intracellular parasites and bacteria. These
antigens are processed in the cytosol by an enzyme complex known as the proteasome and are then brought into the
endoplasmic reticulum by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) system, where they interact with class I
MHC molecules and are eventually transported to the cell surface by a transport vesicle.
