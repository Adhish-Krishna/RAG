This chapter begins by examining elements and how the structures of atoms, the
basic units of matter, determine the characteristics of elements by the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in the
atoms. The chapter then builds the framework of life from there.

2.1 | Elements and Atoms: The Building Blocks of Matter

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 ¢ Discuss the relationships between matter, mass, elements, compounds, atoms, and subatomic particles
¢ Distinguish between atomic number and mass number
¢ Identify the key distinction between isotopes of the same element
¢ Explain how electrons occupy electron shells and their contribution to an atom’s relative stability

The substance of the universe—from a grain of sand to a star—is called matter. Scientists define matter as anything that
occupies space and has mass. An object’s mass and its weight are related concepts, but not quite the same.
