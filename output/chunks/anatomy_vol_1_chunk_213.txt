Like other lipids, cholesterolâ€™s hydrocarbons make it hydrophobic;

however, it has a polar hydroxyl] head that is hydrophilic. Cholesterol is an important component of bile acids, compounds
that help emulsify dietary fats. In fact, the word root chole- refers to bile. Cholesterol is also a building block of many
hormones, signaling molecules that the body releases to regulate processes at distant sites. Finally, like phospholipids,
cholesterol molecules are found in the cell membrane, where their hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions help regulate the
flow of substances into and out of the cell.

 Prostaglandins

Like a hormone, a prostaglandin is one of a group of signaling molecules, but prostaglandins are derived from unsaturated
fatty acids (see Figure 2.23c). One reason that the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish are beneficial is that they stimulate
the production of certain prostaglandins that help regulate aspects of blood pressure and inflammation, and thereby reduce
the risk for heart disease.
