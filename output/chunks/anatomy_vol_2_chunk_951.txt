Given the size difference between most members of the sexes, the weight of a female heart is approximately
250-300 grams (9 to 11 ounces), and the weight of a male heart is approximately 300-350 grams (11 to 12 ounces).
 The heart of a well-trained athlete, especially one specializing in aerobic sports, can be considerably larger than this.
 Cardiac muscle responds to exercise in a manner similar to that of skeletal muscle. That is, exercise results in the addition
of protein myofilaments that increase the size of the individual cells without increasing their numbers, a concept called
hypertrophy. Hearts of athletes can pump blood more effectively at lower rates than those of nonathletes. Enlarged hearts
are not always a result of exercise; they can result from pathologies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The cause
of an abnormally enlarged heart muscle is unknown, but the condition is often undiagnosed and can cause sudden death in
apparently otherwise healthy young people.
