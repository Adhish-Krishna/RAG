The acrosome is oval and somewhat flattened.

 Sperm Transport

To fertilize an egg, sperm must be moved from the seminiferous tubules in the testes, through the epididymis, and—later
during ejaculation—along the length of the penis and out into the female reproductive tract.

 Role of the Epididymis

From the lumen of the seminiferous tubules, the immotile sperm are surrounded by testicular fluid and moved to the
epididymis (plural = epididymides), a coiled tube attached to the testis where newly formed sperm continue to mature (see
Figure 27.4). Though the epididymis does not take up much room in its tightly coiled state, it would be approximately 6
m (20 feet) long if straightened. It takes an average of 12 days for sperm to move through the coils of the epididymis, with
the shortest recorded transit time in humans being one day.
