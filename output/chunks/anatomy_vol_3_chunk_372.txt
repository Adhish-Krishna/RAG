CHAPTER 24 | METABOLISM AND NUTRITION 1101

Ketogenesis

If excessive acetyl CoA is created from the oxidation of fatty acids and the Krebs cycle is overloaded and cannot handle it,
the acetyl CoA is diverted to create ketone bodies. These ketone bodies can serve as a fuel source if glucose levels are too
low in the body. Ketones serve as fuel in times of prolonged starvation or when patients suffer from uncontrolled diabetes
and cannot utilize most of the circulating glucose. In both cases, fat stores are liberated to generate energy through the Krebs
cycle and will generate ketone bodies when too much acetyl CoA accumulates.

 In this ketone synthesis reaction, excess acetyl CoA is converted into hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA (HMG CoA).
 HMG CoA is a precursor of cholesterol and is an intermediate that is subsequently converted into B-hydroxybutyrate, the
primary ketone body in the blood (Figure 24.14).
