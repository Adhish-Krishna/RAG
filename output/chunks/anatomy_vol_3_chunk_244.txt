When most of the chyme has been absorbed, the small intestinal wall becomes less distended. At this point, the
localized segmentation process is replaced by transport movements. The duodenal mucosa secretes the hormone motilin,
which initiates peristalsis in the form of a migrating motility complex. These complexes, which begin in the duodenum,
force chyme through a short section of the small intestine and then stop. The next contraction begins a little bit farther down
than the first, forces chyme a bit farther through the small intestine, then stops. These complexes move slowly down the
small intestine, forcing chyme on the way, taking around 90 to 120 minutes to finally reach the end of the ileum. At this
point, the process is repeated, starting in the duodenum.

 The ileocecal valve, a sphincter, is usually in a constricted state, but when motility in the ileum increases, this sphincter
relaxes, allowing food residue to enter the first portion of the large intestine, the cecum.
