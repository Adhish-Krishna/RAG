A strong blow to this region can fracture the bones around the pterion.
 If the underlying artery is damaged, bleeding can cause the formation of a hematoma (collection of blood) between
the brain and interior of the skull. As blood accumulates, it will put pressure on the brain. Symptoms associated with
a hematoma may not be apparent immediately following the injury, but if untreated, blood accumulation will exert
increasing pressure on the brain and can result in death within a few hours.

View this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/headblow) to see how a blow to the head may produce a
contrecoup (counterblow) fracture of the basilar portion of the occipital bone on the base of the skull. Why may a
basilar fracture be life threatening?

Facial Bones of the Skull

The facial bones of the skull form the upper and lower jaws, the nose, nasal cavity and nasal septum, and the orbit.
