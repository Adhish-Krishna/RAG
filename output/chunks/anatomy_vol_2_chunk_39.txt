Figure 12.3 Gray Matter and White Matter A brain removed during an autopsy, with a partial section removed,
shows white matter surrounded by gray matter. Gray matter makes up the outer cortex of the brain. (credit: modification

 Regardless of the appearance of stained or unstained tissue, the cell bodies of neurons or axons can be located in
discrete anatomical structures that need to be named. Those names are specific to whether the structure is central or
peripheral. A localized collection of neuron cell bodies in the CNS is referred to as a nucleus. In the PNS, a cluster of
neuron cell bodies is referred to as a ganglion. Figure 12.4 indicates how the term nucleus has a few different meanings
within anatomy and physiology. It is the center of an atom, where protons and neutrons are found; it is the center of a cell,
where the DNA is found; and it is a center of some function in the CNS.
