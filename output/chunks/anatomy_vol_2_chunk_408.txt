Appendicular Control

The lateral corticospinal tract is composed of the fibers that cross the midline at the pyramidal decussation (see Figure
14.28). The axons cross over from the anterior position of the pyramids in the medulla to the lateral column of the spinal
cord. These axons are responsible for controlling appendicular muscles.

 This influence over the appendicular muscles means that the lateral corticospinal tract is responsible for moving the
muscles of the arms and legs. The ventral horn in both the lower cervical spinal cord and the lumbar spinal cord both
have wider ventral horns, representing the greater number of muscles controlled by these motor neurons. The cervical
enlargement is particularly large because there is greater control over the fine musculature of the upper limbs, particularly
