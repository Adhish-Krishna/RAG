This is because the fovea is where the least amount of incoming light is absorbed by other retinal structures (see
Figure 14.15). As one moves in either direction from this central point of the retina, visual acuity drops significantly. In
addition, each photoreceptor cell of the fovea is connected to a single RGC. Therefore, this RGC does not have to integrate
inputs from multiple photoreceptors, which reduces the accuracy of visual transduction. Toward the edges of the retina,
several photoreceptors converge on RGCs (through the bipolar cells) up to a ratio of 50 to 1. The difference in visual acuity
between the fovea and peripheral retina is easily evidenced by looking directly at a word in the middle of this paragraph.
 The visual stimulus in the middle of the field of view falls on the fovea and is in the sharpest focus. Without moving your
eyes off that word, notice that words at the beginning or end of the paragraph are not in focus.
