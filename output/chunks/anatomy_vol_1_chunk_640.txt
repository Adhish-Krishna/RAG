Lateral View of Skull

A view of the lateral skull is dominated by the large, rounded brain case above and the upper and lower jaws with their
teeth below (Figure 7.5). Separating these areas is the bridge of bone called the zygomatic arch. The zygomatic arch is the
bony arch on the side of skull that spans from the area of the cheek to just above the ear canal. It is formed by the junction
of two bony processes: a short anterior component, the temporal process of the zygomatic bone (the cheekbone) and a
longer posterior portion, the zygomatic process of the temporal bone, extending forward from the temporal bone. Thus
the temporal process (anteriorly) and the zygomatic process (posteriorly) join together, like the two ends of a drawbridge, to
form the zygomatic arch. One of the major muscles that pulls the mandible upward during biting and chewing arises from
the zygomatic arch.
