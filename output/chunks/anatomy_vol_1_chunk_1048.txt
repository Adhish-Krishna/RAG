The muscle fiber will repolarize, which closes the gates in the SR

where Ca** was being released. ATP-driven pumps will move Ca’ ~ out of the sarcoplasm back into the SR. This results in
the “reshielding” of the actin-binding sites on the thin filaments. Without the ability to form cross-bridges between the thin
and thick filaments, the muscle fiber loses its tension and relaxes.

 Muscle Strength

The number of skeletal muscle fibers in a given muscle is genetically determined and does not change. Muscle strength
is directly related to the amount of myofibrils and sarcomeres within each fiber. Factors, such as hormones and stress
(and artificial anabolic steroids), acting on the muscle can increase the production of sarcomeres and myofibrils within the
muscle fibers, a change called hypertrophy, which results in the increased mass and bulk in a skeletal muscle.
