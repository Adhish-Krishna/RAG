The hip bone articulates
posteriorly at the sacroiliac joint with the sacrum, which is part of the axial skeleton. The right and left hip bones converge
anteriorly and articulate with each other at the pubic symphysis. The combination of the hip bone, the sacrum, and the
coccyx forms the pelvis. The pelvis has a pronounced anterior tilt. The primary function of the pelvis is to support the upper
body and transfer body weight to the lower limbs. It also serves as the site of attachment for multiple muscles.
 The hip bone consists of three regions: the ilium, ischium, and pubis. The ilium forms the large, fan-like region of the
hip bone. The superior margin of this area is the iliac crest. Located at either end of the iliac crest are the anterior superior
and posterior superior iliac spines. Inferior to these are the anterior inferior and posterior inferior iliac spines. The auricular
surface of the ilium articulates with the sacrum to form the sacroiliac joint.
