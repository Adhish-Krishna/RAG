Chiropractor

Chiropractors are health professionals who use nonsurgical techniques to help patients with musculoskeletal system
problems that involve the bones, muscles, ligaments, tendons, or nervous system. They treat problems such as neck
pain, back pain, joint pain, or headaches. Chiropractors focus on the patient’s overall health and can also provide
counseling related to lifestyle issues, such as diet, exercise, or sleep problems. If needed, they will refer the patient to
other medical specialists.

 Chiropractors use a drug-free, hands-on approach for patient diagnosis and treatment. They will perform a
physical exam, assess the patient’s posture and spine, and may perform additional diagnostic tests, including taking
X-ray images. They primarily use manual techniques, such as spinal manipulation, to adjust the patient’s spine or
other joints.
