These techniques allow clinicians to visualize structures inside the living body such as a
cancerous tumor or a fractured bone.

 Like most scientific disciplines, anatomy has areas of specialization. Gross anatomy is the study of the larger
structures of the body, those visible without the aid of magnification (Figure 1.2a). Macro- means “large,” thus, gross
anatomy is also referred to as macroscopic anatomy. In contrast, micro- means “small,” and microscopic anatomy is
the study of structures that can be observed only with the use of a microscope or other magnification devices (Figure
1.2b). Microscopic anatomy includes cytology, the study of cells and histology, the study of tissues. As the technology of
microscopes has advanced, anatomists have been able to observe smaller and smaller structures of the body, from slices of
large structures like the heart, to the three-dimensional structures of large molecules in the body.
