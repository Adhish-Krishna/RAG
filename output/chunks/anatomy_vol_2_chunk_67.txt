 Glial Cells

Glial cells, or neuroglia or simply glia, are the other type of cell found in nervous tissue. They are considered to be
supporting cells, and many functions are directed at helping neurons complete their function for communication. The name
glia comes from the Greek word that means “glue,” and was coined by the German pathologist Rudolph Virchow, who
wrote in 1856: “This connective substance, which is in the brain, the spinal cord, and the special sense nerves, is a kind of
glue (neuroglia) in which the nervous elements are planted.”
