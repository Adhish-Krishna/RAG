At birth, children with a clubfoot have the heel turned inward and the anterior foot twisted so that the lateral
side of the foot is facing inferiorly, commonly due to ligaments or leg muscles attached to the foot that are shortened
or abnormally tight. These pull the foot into an abnormal position, resulting in bone deformities. Other symptoms
may include bending of the ankle that lifts the heel of the foot and an extremely high foot arch. Due to the limited
range of motion in the affected foot, it is difficult to place the foot into the correct position. Additionally, the affected
foot may be shorter than normal, and the calf muscles are usually underdeveloped on the affected side. Despite the
appearance, this is not a painful condition for newborns. However, it must be treated early to avoid future pain and
impaired walking ability.
