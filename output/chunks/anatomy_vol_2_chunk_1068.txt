They innervate the heart via sympathetic
cardiac nerves that increase cardiac activity and vagus (parasympathetic) nerves that slow cardiac activity.

 Parasympathetic stimulation originates from the cardioinhibitory region with impulses traveling via the vagus nerve
(cranial nerve X). The vagus nerve sends branches to both the SA and AV nodes, and to portions of both the atria and
ventricles. Parasympathetic stimulation releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction.
 ACh slows HR by opening chemical- or ligand-gated potassium ion channels to slow the rate of spontaneous depolarization,
which extends repolarization and increases the time before the next spontaneous depolarization occurs. Without any nervous
stimulation, the SA node would establish a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm. Since resting rates are considerably less
than this, it becomes evident that parasympathetic stimulation normally slows HR. This is similar to an individual driving
a car with one foot on the brake pedal. To speed up, one need merely remove oneâ€™s foot from the break and let the engine
increase speed.
