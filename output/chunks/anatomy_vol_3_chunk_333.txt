Metabolic diseases are most commonly
the result of malfunctioning proteins or enzymes that are critical to one or more metabolic pathways. Protein or
enzyme malfunction can be the consequence of a genetic alteration or mutation. However, normally functioning
proteins and enzymes can also have deleterious effects if their availability is not appropriately matched with metabolic
need. For example, excessive production of the hormone cortisol (see Table 24.1) gives rise to Cushing syndrome.
 Clinically, Cushing syndrome is characterized by rapid weight gain, especially in the trunk and face region, depression,

and anxiety. It is worth mentioning that tumors of the
which subsequently stimulates the adrenal cortex to re

pituitary that produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH),
lease excessive cortisol, produce similar effects. This indirect

mechanism of cortisol overproduction is referred to as Cushing disease.

 Patients with Cushing syndrome can exhibit high
obese. They also show slow growth, accumulation of

blood glucose levels and are at an increased risk of becoming
â€˜at between the shoulders, weak muscles, bone pain (because

cortisol causes proteins to be broken down to make glucose via gluconeogenesis), and fatigue.
