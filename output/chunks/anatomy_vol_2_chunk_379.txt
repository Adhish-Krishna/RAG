The connections of the retina into the CNS are a holdover
from this developmental association. The majority of the connections of the optic tract are to the thalamusâ€”specifically,
the lateral geniculate nucleus. Axons from this nucleus then project to the visual cortex of the cerebrum, located in the
occipital lobe. Another target of the optic tract is the superior colliculus.

 In addition, a very small number of RGC axons project from the optic chiasm to the suprachiasmatic nucleus of
the hypothalamus. These RGCs are photosensitive, in that they respond to the presence or absence of light. Unlike the
photoreceptors, however, these photosensitive RGCs cannot be used to perceive images. By simply responding to the
absence or presence of light, these RGCs can send information about day length. The perceived proportion of sunlight to
darkness establishes the circadian rhythm of our bodies, allowing certain physiological events to occur at approximately
the same time every day.
