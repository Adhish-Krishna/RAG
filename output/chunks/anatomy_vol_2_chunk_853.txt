Capillary beds are extremely narrow, slowing the passage of the erythrocytes and providing an extended
opportunity for gas exchange to occur. However, the space within capillaries can be so minute that, despite their own smal.
size, erythrocytes may have to fold in on themselves if they are to make their way through. Fortunately, their structural
proteins like spectrin are flexible, allowing them to bend over themselves to a surprising degree, then spring back again
when they enter a wider vessel. In wider vessels, erythrocytes may stack up much like a roll of coins, forming a rouleaux,
from the French word for “roll.”

 Figure 18.6 Shape of Red Blood Cells Erythrocytes are biconcave discs with very shallow centers. This shape
optimizes the ratio of surface area to volume, facilitating gas exchange. It also enables them to fold up as they move
through narrow blood vessels.

 Hemoglobin

Hemoglobin is a large molecule made up of proteins and iron.
