The heads
can then attach to actin-binding sites and pull on the thin filaments. The thin filaments also are anchored to the dense
bodies; the structures invested in the inner membrane of the sarcolemma (at adherens junctions) that also have cord-like
intermediate filaments attached to them. When the thin filaments slide past the thick filaments, they pull on the dense bodies,
structures tethered to the sarcolemma, which then pull on the intermediate filaments networks throughout the sarcoplasm.
 This arrangement causes the entire muscle fiber to contract in a manner whereby the ends are pulled toward the center,
causing the midsection to bulge in a corkscrew motion (Figure 10.24).

Figure 10.24 Muscle Contraction The dense bodies and intermediate filaments are networked through the
sarcoplasm, which cause the muscle fiber to contract.

 Although smooth muscle contraction relies on the presence of Ca** ions, smooth muscle fibers have a much smaller
diameter than skeletal muscle cells.
