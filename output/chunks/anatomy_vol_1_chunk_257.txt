A single phospholipid molecule has a phosphate group on one end, called the “head,” and two side-by-side chains of
atty acids that make up the lipid tails (Figure 3.2). The phosphate group is negatively charged, making the head polar and
hydrophilic—or “water loving.” A hydrophilic molecule (or region of a molecule) is one that is attracted to water. The
phosphate heads are thus attracted to the water molecules of both the extracellular and intracellular environments. The lipid
tails, on the other hand, are uncharged, or nonpolar, and are hydrophobic—or “water fearing.” A hydrophobic molecule
(or region of a molecule) repels and is repelled by water. Some lipid tails consist of saturated fatty acids and some contain
unsaturated fatty acids. This combination adds to the fluidity of the tails that are constantly in motion. Phospholipids are
thus amphipathic molecules. An amphipathic molecule is one that contains both a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic region.
