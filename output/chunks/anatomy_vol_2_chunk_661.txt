The examiner may also push the subject to see if they
can maintain balance. An abnormal finding in the test of station is if the feet are placed far apart. Why would a wide
stance suggest problems with cerebellar function?

The Field Sobriety Test

The neurological exam has been described as a clinical tool throughout this chapter. It is also useful in other ways.
 A variation of the coordination exam is the Field Sobriety Test (FST) used to assess whether drivers are under the
influence of alcohol. The cerebellum is crucial for coordinated movements such as keeping balance while walking,
or moving appendicular musculature on the basis of proprioceptive feedback. The cerebellum is also very sensitive to
ethanol, the particular type of alcohol found in beer, wine, and liquor.

 Walking in a straight line involves comparing the motor command from the primary motor cortex to the
proprioceptive and vestibular sensory feedback, as well as following the visual guide of the white line on the side of the
road.
