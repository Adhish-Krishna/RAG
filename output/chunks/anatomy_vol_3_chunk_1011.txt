Spasticity refers to what could be called “hypercontractility” of the muscles in the absence
of the descending input. 42 The spinocerebellum is related to controlling the axial muscles and keeps the body balanced on the
bike. The cerebrocerebellum is related to controlling the appendicular muscles and keeps the legs moving to pedal the bike. The
vestibulocerebellum receives input about equilibrium to help keep everything balanced as the bike is moving forward. 43 Rapid
alternating movements in speech relate to how the lips, tongue, and palate move to produce speech sounds. The cerebrocerebellum
is required for the proper implementation of these movements.
