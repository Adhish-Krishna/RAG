Such a
situation can be cause for an emergency birth with vacuum, forceps, or surgically by Caesarian section.

 The amniotic membranes rupture before the onset of labor in about 12 percent of women; they typically rupture at the
end of the dilation stage in response to excessive pressure from the fetal head entering the birth canal.

Expulsion Stage

The expulsion stage begins when the fetal head enters the birth canal and ends with birth of the newborn. It typically takes
up to 2 hours, but it can last longer or be completed in minutes, depending in part on the orientation of the fetus. The vertex
presentation known as the occiput anterior vertex is the most common presentation and is associated with the greatest ease
of vaginal birth. The fetus faces the maternal spinal cord and the smallest part of the head (the posterior aspect called the
occiput) exits the birth canal first.
