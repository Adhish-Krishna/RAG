Maternal anti-Rh antibodies may cross the placenta and
enter the fetal bloodstream, causing agglutination and hemolysis of fetal erythrocytes.

 A drug known as RhoGAM, short for Rh immune globulin, can temporarily prevent the development of Rh antibodies
in the Rh mother, thereby averting this potentially serious disease for the fetus. RhoGAM antibodies destroy any fetal Rh*
erythrocytes that may cross the placental barrier. RhoGAM is normally administered to Rh_ mothers during weeks 26-28
of pregnancy and within 72 hours following birth. It has proven remarkably effective in decreasing the incidence of HDN.

 Earlier we noted that the incidence of HDN in an Rh* subsequent pregnancy to an Rh_ mother is about 13-14 percent
without preventive treatment. Since the introduction of RhoGAM in 1968, the incidence has dropped to about 0.1 percent
in the United States.
