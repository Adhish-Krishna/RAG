Some symptoms of alkalosis include cognitive impairment (which
can progress to unconsciousness), tingling or numbness in the extremities, muscle twitching and spasm, and nausea and
vomiting. Both acidosis and alkalosis can be caused by either metabolic or respiratory disorders.

 As discussed earlier in this chapter, the concentration of carbonic acid in the blood is dependent on the level of CO2
in the body and the amount of CO2 gas exhaled through the lungs. Thus, the respiratory contribution to acid-base balance
is usually discussed in terms of CO2 (rather than of carbonic acid). Remember that a molecule of carbonic acid is lost for
every molecule of CO2 exhaled, and a molecule of carbonic acid is formed for every molecule of CO? retained.
