How would muscle contractions be affected if skeletal
muscle fibers did not have T-tubules?

36. What causes the striated appearance of skeletal muscle
tissue?
37. How would muscle contractions be affected if ATP was
completely depleted in a muscle fiber?

39. What factors contribute to the amount of tension
produced in an individual muscle fiber?

40. Why do muscle cells use creatine phosphate instead of
glycolysis to supply ATP for the first few seconds of muscle
contraction?
