Neural mechanisms include the cardiovascular centers in the medulla oblongata, baroreceptors in the aorta
and carotid arteries and right atrium, and associated chemoreceptors that monitor blood levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide,
and hydrogen ions. Endocrine controls include epinephrine and norepinephrine, as well as ADH, the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone mechanism, ANH, and EPO. Autoregulation is the local control of vasodilation and constriction by chemical
signals and the myogenic response. Exercise greatly improves cardiovascular function and reduces the risk of cardiovascular
diseases, including hypertension, a leading cause of heart attacks and strokes. Significant hemorrhage can lead to a form
of circulatory shock known as hypovolemic shock. Sepsis, obstruction, and widespread inflammation can also cause
circulatory shock.

20.5 Circulatory Pathways

The right ventricle pumps oxygen-depleted blood into the pulmonary trunk and right and left pulmonary arteries, which
carry it to the right and left lungs for gas exchange.
