The overall reaction for the conversion
of the energy in glucose to energy stored in ATP can be written:

C6 Hi20, +60, > 6CO, +6H,0+ ATP

In addition to being a critical fuel source, carbohydrates are present in very small amounts in cellsâ€™ structure. For
instance, some carbohydrate molecules bind with proteins to produce glycoproteins, and others combine with lipids to
produce glycolipids, both of which are found in the membrane that encloses the contents of body cells.

 Lipids
A lipid is one of a highly diverse group of compounds made up mostly of hydrocarbons. The few oxygen atoms they contain

are often at the periphery of the molecule. Their nonpolar hydrocarbons make all lipids hydrophobic. In water, lipids do not
form a true solution, but they may form an emulsion, which is the term for a mixture of solutions that do not mix well.
