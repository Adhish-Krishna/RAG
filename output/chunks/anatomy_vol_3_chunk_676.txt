Sperm enter the head of the epididymis and are moved along
predominantly by the contraction of smooth muscles lining the epididymal tubes. As they are moved along the length of
the epididymis, the sperm further mature and acquire the ability to move under their own power. Once inside the female
reproductive tract, they will use this ability to move independently toward the unfertilized egg. The more mature sperm are
then stored in the tail of the epididymis (the final section) until ejaculation occurs.

 Duct System

During ejaculation, sperm exit the tail of the epididymis and are pushed by smooth muscle contraction to the ductus
deferens (also called the vas deferens). The ductus deferens is a thick, muscular tube that is bundled together inside the
scrotum with connective tissue, blood vessels, and nerves into a structure called the spermatic cord (see Figure 27.2 and
Figure 27.3).
