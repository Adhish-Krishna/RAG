Increased exercise can produce greater numbers of cellular mitochondria,
increase capillary density, and increase the mass and strength of connective tissue. The effects of age-related atrophy
are especially pronounced in people who are sedentary, as the loss of muscle cells is displayed as functional
impairments such as trouble with locomotion, balance, and posture. This can lead to a decrease in quality of life and
medical problems, such as joint problems because the muscles that stabilize bones and joints are weakened. Problems
with locomotion and balance can also cause various injuries due to falls.
