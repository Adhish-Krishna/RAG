If you swallow a large bolus of food, for instance, you will probably feel the lump of that food as it pushes through your
esophagus, or even if your stomach is distended after a large meal. If you inhale especially cold air, you can feel it as it
enters your larynx and trachea. These sensations are not the same as feeling high blood pressure or blood sugar levels.

 When particularly strong visceral sensations rise to the level of conscious perception, the sensations are often felt in
unexpected places. For example, strong visceral sensations of the heart will be felt as pain in the left shoulder and left
arm. This irregular pattern of projection of conscious perception of visceral sensations is called referred pain. Depending
on the organ system affected, the referred pain will project to different areas of the body (Figure 15.7). The location of
referred pain is not random, but a definitive explanation of the mechanism has not been established.
