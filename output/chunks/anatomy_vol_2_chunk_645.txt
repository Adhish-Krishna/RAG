Other
signs of an LMN lesion are fibrillation, fasciculation, and compromised or lost reflexes resulting from the denervation of
the muscle fibers.

Spinal Cord

In certain situations, such as a motorcycle accident, only half of the spinal cord may be damaged in what is known
as a hemisection. Forceful trauma to the trunk may cause ribs or vertebrae to fracture, and debris can crush or section
through part of the spinal cord. The full section of a spinal cord would result in paraplegia, or loss of voluntary motor
control of the lower body, as well as loss of sensations from that point down. A hemisection, however, will leave spinal
cord tracts intact on one side. The resulting condition would be hemiplegia on the side of the traumaâ€”one leg would
be paralyzed. The sensory results are more complicated.

 The ascending tracts in the spinal cord are segregated between the dorsal column and spinothalamic pathways.
