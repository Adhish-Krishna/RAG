This opening is an artifact of the dry skull, because in life it is completely filled with cartilage. All
the openings of the skull that provide for passage of nerves or blood vessels have smooth margins; the word lacerum
(“ragged” or “torn”) tells us that this opening has ragged edges and thus nothing passes through it.

 Posterior Cranial Fossa

The posterior cranial fossa is the most posterior and deepest portion of the cranial cavity. It contains the cerebellum of the
brain. The posterior fossa is bounded anteriorly by the petrous ridges, while the occipital bone forms the floor and posterior
wall. It is divided at the midline by the large foramen magnum (“great aperture”), the opening that provides for passage of
the spinal cord.

 Located on the medial wall of the petrous ridge in the posterior cranial fossa is the internal acoustic meatus (see Figure
7.11).
