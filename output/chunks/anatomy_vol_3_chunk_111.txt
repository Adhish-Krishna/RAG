CHAPTER 22 | THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 1007

22.6 | Modifications in Respiratory Functions

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 ¢ Define the terms hyperpnea and hyperventilation
¢ Describe the effect of exercise on the respiratory system
¢ Describe the effect of high altitude on the respiratory system
* Discuss the process of acclimatization

At rest, the respiratory system performs its functions at a constant, rhythmic pace, as regulated by the respiratory centers of
the brain.
