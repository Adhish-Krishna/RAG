Non-tasters can
taste food, but they are not as sensitive to certain tastes, such as bitterness. Dr. Reed discovered that she is a non-taster,
which explains why she perceived bitterness differently than other people she knew. Are you very sensitive to tastes?
 Can you see any similarities among the members of your family?

Olfaction (Smell)

Like taste, the sense of smell, or olfaction, is also responsive to chemical stimuli. The olfactory receptor neurons are located
in a small region within the superior nasal cavity (Figure 14.4). This region is referred to as the olfactory epithelium and
contains bipolar sensory neurons. Each olfactory sensory neuron has dendrites that extend from the apical surface of the
epithelium into the mucus lining the cavity. As airborne molecules are inhaled through the nose, they pass over the olfactory
epithelial region and dissolve into the mucus. These odorant molecules bind to proteins that keep them dissolved in the
mucus and help transport them to the olfactory dendrites.
