 For blocked coronary arteries, surgery is warranted. In angioplasty, a catheter is inserted into the vessel at the point

of narrowing, and a second catheter with a balloon-like tip is inflated to widen the opening. To prevent subsequent
collapse of the vessel, a small mesh tube called a stent is often inserted. In an endarterectomy, plaque is surgically
removed from the walls of a vessel. This operation is typically performed on the carotid arteries of the neck, which are
a prime source of oxygenated blood for the brain. In a coronary bypass procedure, a non-vital superficial vessel from
another part of the body (often the great saphenous vein) or a synthetic vessel is inserted to create a path around the
blocked area of a coronary artery.
