The amino
acids are then transported into the bloodstream for dispersal to the liver and cells throughout the body to be used to create
new proteins. When in excess, the amino acids are processed and stored as glucose or ketones. The nitrogen waste that is
liberated in this process is converted to urea in the urea acid cycle and eliminated in the urine. In times of starvation, amino
acids can be used as an energy source and processed through the Krebs cycle.

 24.5 Metabolic States of the Body

There are three main metabolic states of the body: absorptive (fed), postabsorptive (fasting), and starvation. During any
given day, your metabolism switches between absorptive and postabsorptive states. Starvation states happen very rarely in
generally well-nourished individuals. When the body is fed, glucose, fats, and proteins are absorbed across the intestinal
membrane and enter the bloodstream and lymphatic system to be used immediately for fuel.
