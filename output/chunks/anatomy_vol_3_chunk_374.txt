This keeps the brain functioning when glucose is limited. When ketones are produced faster
than they can be used, they can be broken down into CO2 and acetone. The acetone is removed by exhalation. One symptom
of ketogenesis is that the patientâ€™s breath smells sweet like alcohol. This effect provides one way of telling if a diabetic
is properly controlling the disease. The carbon dioxide produced can acidify the blood, leading to diabetic ketoacidosis, a
dangerous condition in diabetics.

 Ketones oxidize to produce energy for the brain. beta (B)-hydroxybutyrate is oxidized to acetoacetate and NADH is
released. An HS-CoA molecule is added to acetoacetate, forming acetoacetyl CoA. The carbon within the acetoacetyl CoA
that is not bonded to the CoA then detaches, splitting the molecule in two. This carbon then attaches to another free HS-
CoA, resulting in two acetyl CoA molecules. These two acetyl CoA molecules are then processed through the Krebs cycle
to generate energy (Figure 24.15).
