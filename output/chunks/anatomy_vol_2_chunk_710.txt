* The antagonistic effect, in which two hormones have opposing effects. A familiar example is the effect of two
pancreatic hormones, insulin and glucagon. Insulin increases the liverâ€™s storage of glucose as glycogen, decreasing
blood glucose, whereas glucagon stimulates the breakdown of glycogen stores, increasing blood glucose.

 Regulation of Hormone Secretion

To prevent abnormal hormone levels and a potential disease state, hormone levels must be tightly controlled. The body
maintains this control by balancing hormone production and degradation. Feedback loops govern the initiation and
maintenance of most hormone secretion in response to various stimuli.

 Role of Feedback Loops

The contribution of feedback loops to homeostasis will only be briefly reviewed here. Positive feedback loops are
characterized by the release of additional hormone in response to an original hormone release. The release of oxytocin
during childbirth is a positive feedback loop. The initial release of oxytocin begins to signal the uterine muscles to contract,
which pushes the fetus toward the cervix, causing it to stretch.
