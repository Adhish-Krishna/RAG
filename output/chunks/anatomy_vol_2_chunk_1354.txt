Macrophages move through tissues and squeeze through capillary walls using pseudopodia. They not only
participate in innate immune responses but have also evolved to cooperate with lymphocytes as part of the adaptive
immune response. Macrophages exist in many tissues of the body, either freely roaming through connective tissues or
fixed to reticular fibers within specific tissues such as lymph nodes. When pathogens breach the bodyâ€™s barrier defenses,
macrophages are the first line of defense (Table 21.3). They are called different names, depending on the tissue: Kupffer
cells in the liver, histiocytes in connective tissue, and alveolar macrophages in the lungs.

 A neutrophil is a phagocytic cell that is attracted via chemotaxis from the bloodstream to infected tissues. These
spherical cells are granulocytes. A granulocyte contains cytoplasmic granules, which in turn contain a variety of vasoactive
mediators such as histamine. In contrast, macrophages are agranulocytes. An agranulocyte has few or no cytoplasmic
granules. Whereas macrophages act like sentries, always on guard against infection, neutrophils can be thought of as
military reinforcements that are called into a battle to hasten the destruction of the enemy.
