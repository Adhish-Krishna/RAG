The affected individual might experience weakness, lethargy, shortness of breath, anemia, widespread edema (swelling),
metabolic acidosis, rising potassium levels, heart arrhythmias, and more. Each of these functions is vital to your well-being
and survival. The urinary system, controlled by the nervous system, also stores urine until a convenient time for disposal and
then provides the anatomical structures to transport this waste liquid to the outside of the body. Failure of nervous control
or the anatomical structures leading to a loss of control of urination results in a condition called incontinence.

 This chapter will help you to understand the anatomy of the urinary system and how it enables the physiologic
functions critical to homeostasis. It is best to think of the kidney as a regulator of plasma makeup rather than simply a urine
producer. As you read each section, ask yourself this question: “What happens if this does not work?”
