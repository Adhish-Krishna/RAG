You will also find examples of anastomoses where two blood vessels that previously branched reconnect.
 Anastomoses are especially common in veins, where they help maintain blood flow even when one vessel is blocked or
narrowed, although there are some important ones in the arteries supplying the brain.

 As you read about circular pathways, notice that there is an occasional, very large artery referred to as a trunk, a term
indicating that the vessel gives rise to several smaller arteries. For example, the celiac trunk gives rise to the left gastric,
