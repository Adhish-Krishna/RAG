Decreasing calcium absorption in the intestines
* Increasing calcium loss in the urine
However, these functions are usually not significant in maintaining calcium homeostasis, so the importance of
calcitonin is not entirely understood. Pharmaceutical preparations of calcitonin are sometimes prescribed to reduce
osteoclast activity in people with osteoporosis and to reduce the degradation of cartilage in people with osteoarthritis. The
hormones secreted by thyroid are summarized in Table 17.4.

Of course, calcium is critical for many other biological processes. It is a second messenger in many signaling pathways,
and is essential for muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, and blood clotting. Given these roles, it is not surprising
that blood calcium levels are tightly regulated by the endocrine system. The organs involved in the regulation are the
parathyroid glands.
