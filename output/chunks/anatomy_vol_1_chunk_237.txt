Chemical reactions begin with reactants and end with products. Synthesis reactions bond reactants together, a process
that requires energy, whereas decomposition reactions break the bonds within a reactant and thereby release energy. In
exchange reactions, bonds are both broken and formed, and energy is exchanged.

CHAPTER 2 | THE CHEMICAL LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION 83

The rate at which chemical reactions occur is influenced by several properties of the reactants: temperature,
concentration and pressure, and the presence or absence of a catalyst. An enzyme is a catalytic protein that speeds up
chemical reactions in the human body.

2.4 Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning

Inorganic compounds essential to human functioning include water, salts, acids, and bases. These compounds are inorganic;
that is, they do not contain both hydrogen and carbon. Water is a lubricant and cushion, a heat sink, a component of liquid
mixtures, a byproduct of dehydration synthesis reactions, and a reactant in hydrolysis reactions.
