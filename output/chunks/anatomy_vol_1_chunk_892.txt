Because cartilage is softer
than bone tissue, injury to a growing long bone can damage the epiphyseal plate cartilage, thus stopping bone growth and
preventing additional bone lengthening.

Growing layers of cartilage also form synchondroses that join together the ilium, ischium, and pubic portions of the hip
bone during childhood and adolescence. When body growth stops, the cartilage disappears and is replaced by bone, forming
synostoses and fusing the bony components together into the single hip bone of the adult. Similarly, synostoses unite the
sacral vertebrae that fuse together to form the adult sacrum.

Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/childhand) to view a radiograph (X-ray image) of a childâ€™s hand and
wrist. The growing bones of child have an epiphyseal plate that forms a synchondrosis between the shaft and end of a
long bone. Being less dense than bone, the area of epiphyseal cartilage is seen on this radiograph as the dark epiphyseal
gaps located near the ends of the long bones, including the radius, ulna, metacarpal, and phalanx bones.
