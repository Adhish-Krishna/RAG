During early development, embryonic myoblasts, each with its own nucleus, fuse with up to hundreds of other
myoblasts to form the multinucleated skeletal muscle fibers. Multiple nuclei mean multiple copies of genes, permitting the
production of the large amounts of proteins and enzymes needed for muscle contraction.

 Some other terminology associated with muscle fibers is rooted in the Greek sarco, which means “flesh.” The plasma
membrane of muscle fibers is called the sarcolemma, the cytoplasm is referred to as sarcoplasm, and the specialized
smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which stores, releases, and retrieves calcium ions (Ca**) is called the sarcoplasmic
reticulum (SR) (Figure 10.4). As will soon be described, the functional unit of a skeletal muscle fiber is the sarcomere, a

other support proteins.
