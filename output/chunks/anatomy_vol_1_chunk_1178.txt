The diaphragm also includes three openings for the passage of structures between the thorax and the abdomen. The
inferior vena cava passes through the caval opening, and the esophagus and attached nerves pass through the esophageal
hiatus. The aorta, thoracic duct, and azygous vein pass through the aortic hiatus of the posterior diaphragm.

 The Intercostal Muscles

There are three sets of muscles, called intercostal muscles, which span each of the intercostal spaces. The principal role of
the intercostal muscles is to assist in breathing by changing the dimensions of the rib cage (Figure 11.18).
