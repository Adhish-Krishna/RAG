Finally, a plan is developed about what to do,
whether that is to turn the temperature up, turn the whole shower off and go back to bed, or step into the shower. To do any
of these things, the cerebral cortex has to send a command out to your body to move muscles (Figure 12.16).

Figure 12.16 The Motor Response On the basis of the sensory input and the integration in the CNS, a motor
response is formulated and executed.

 A region of the cortex is specialized for sending signals down to the spinal cord for movement. The upper motor
neuron is in this region, called the precentral gyrus of the frontal cortex, which has an axon that extends all the way
down the spinal cord. At the level of the spinal cord at which this axon makes a synapse, a graded potential occurs in the
cell membrane of a lower motor neuron.
