Respiratory rate is the number of
breaths taken per minute, which may change during certain diseases or conditions.

 Both respiratory rate and depth are controlled by the respiratory centers of the brain, which are stimulated by factors
such as chemical and pH changes in the blood. These changes are sensed by central chemoreceptors, which are located in
the brain, and peripheral chemoreceptors, which are located in the aortic arch and carotid arteries. A rise in carbon dioxide
or a decline in oxygen levels in the blood stimulates an increase in respiratory rate and depth.

22.4 Gas Exchange

The behavior of gases can be explained by the principles of Dalton’s law and Henry’s law, both of which describe aspects of
gas exchange. Dalton’s law states that each specific gas in a mixture of gases exerts force (its partial pressure) independently
of the other gases in the mixture.
