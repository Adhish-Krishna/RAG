However,
due to certain characteristics of the lungs, the intrapleural pressure is always lower than, or negative to, the intra-alveolar
pressure (and therefore also to atmospheric pressure). Although it fluctuates during inspiration and expiration, intrapleural
pressure remains approximately —4 mm Hg throughout the breathing cycle.

 Competing forces within the thorax cause the formation of the negative intrapleural pressure. One of these forces
relates to the elasticity of the lungs themselves—elastic tissue pulls the lungs inward, away from the thoracic wall. Surface
tension of alveolar fluid, which is mostly water, also creates an inward pull of the lung tissue. This inward tension from

the lungs is countered by opposing forces from the pleural
cavity pulls the lungs outward. Too much or too little pleural
pressure; therefore, the level must be closely monitored by t

luid and thoracic wall. Surface tension within the pleural
fluid would hinder the creation of the negative intrapleura
he mesothelial cells and drained by the lymphatic system.
