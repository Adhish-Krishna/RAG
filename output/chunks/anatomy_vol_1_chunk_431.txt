Compare and contrast the functions of each muscle tissue type
Â¢ Explain how muscle tissue can enable motion

Muscle tissue is characterized by properties that allow movement. Muscle cells are excitable; they respond to a stimulus.
 They are contractile, meaning they can shorten and generate a pulling force. When attached between two movable objects,
in other words, bones, contractions of the muscles cause the bones to move. Some muscle movement is voluntary, which
means it is under conscious control. For example, a person decides to open a book and read a chapter on anatomy. Other
movements are involuntary, meaning they are not under conscious control, such as the contraction of your pupil in bright
light. Muscle tissue is classified into three types according to structure and function: skeletal, cardiac, and smooth (Table
4.2).

Skeletal -
peripherally located organs to body (e.g., mouth,
nuclei anus)
