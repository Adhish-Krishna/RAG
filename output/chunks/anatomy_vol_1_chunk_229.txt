In DNA, two such
backbones attach at their protruding bases via hydrogen bonds. These twist to form a shape known as a double helix (Figure
2.29). The sequence of nitrogen-containing bases within a strand of DNA form the genes that act as a molecular code
instructing cells in the assembly of amino acids into proteins. Humans have almost 22,000 genes in their DNA, locked up
in the 46 chromosomes inside the nucleus of each cell (except red blood cells which lose their nuclei during development).
 These genes carry the genetic code to build oneâ€™s body, and are unique for each individual except identical twins.
