 What effect does drinking seawater have on the body?

Bicarbonate

Bicarbonate is the second most abundant anion in the blood. Its principal function is to maintain your bodyâ€™s acid-base
balance by being part of buffer systems. This role will be discussed in a different section.

 Bicarbonate ions result from a chemical reaction that starts with carbon dioxide (CO2) and water, two molecules that
are produced at the end of aerobic metabolism. Only a small amount of CO2 can be dissolved in body fluids. Thus, over 90

percent of the CO2 is converted into bicarbonate ions, HCO3 , through the following reactions:
CO, +H,0 + H,CO; + H,CO3. +H*

The bidirectional arrows indicate that the reactions can go in either direction, depending on the concentrations of the
reactants and products.
