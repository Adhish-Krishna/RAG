You will explore the process of cell division later in the chapter.

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/DNArep) to learn about DNA replication. DNA replication proceeds
simultaneously at several sites on the same molecule. What separates the base pair at the start of DNA replication?

3.4 | Protein Synthesis

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 ¢ Explain how the genetic code stored within DNA determines the protein that will form
* Describe the process of transcription
¢ Describe the process of translation

 ¢ Discuss the function of ribosomes

It was mentioned earlier that DNA provides a “blueprint” for the cell structure and physiology. This refers to the fact
that DNA contains the information necessary for the cell to build one very important type of molecule: the protein. Most
structural components of the cell are made up, at least in part, by proteins and virtually all the functions that a cell carries
out are completed with the help of proteins.
