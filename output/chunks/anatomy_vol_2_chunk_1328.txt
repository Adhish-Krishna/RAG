The rapid but nonspecific innate immune response, which consists of a variety of specialized cells and soluble factors
* The slower but more specific and effective adaptive immune response, which involves many cell types and soluble
factors, but is primarily controlled by white blood cells (leukocytes) known as lymphocytes, which help control
immune responses
The cells of the blood, including all those involved in the immune response, arise in the bone marrow via various
differentiation pathways from hematopoietic stem cells (Figure 21.5). In contrast with embryonic stem cells, hematopoietic
stem cells are present throughout adulthood and allow for the continuous differentiation of blood cells to replace those lost
to age or function. These cells can be divided into three classes based on function:
* Phagocytic cells, which ingest pathogens to destroy them
* Lymphocytes, which specifically coordinate the activities of adaptive immunity
*
