If movement of a visual stimulus is leftward in one eye and rightward in the opposite eye, the brain
interprets this as movement toward (or away) from the face along the midline. If both eyes see an object moving in the
same direction, but at different rates, what would that mean for spatial movement?

Depth Perception, 3-D Movies, and Optical Illusions

The visual field is projected onto the retinal surface, where photoreceptors transduce light energy into neural signals
for the brain to interpret. The retina is a two-dimensional surface, so it does not encode three-dimensional information.
 However, we can perceive depth. How is that accomplished?

Two ways in which we can extract depth information from the two-dimensional retinal signal are based on
monocular cues and binocular cues, respectively.
