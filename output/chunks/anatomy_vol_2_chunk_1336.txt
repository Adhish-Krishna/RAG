The connective tissue capsule further divides the thymus into lobules via extensions called trabeculae. The outer region
of the organ is known as the cortex and contains large numbers of thymocytes with some epithelial cells, macrophages, and
dendritic cells (two types of phagocytic cells that are derived from monocytes). The cortex is densely packed so it stains
more intensely than the rest of the thymus (see Figure 21.7). The medulla, where thymocytes migrate before leaving the
thymus, contains a less dense collection of thymocytes, epithelial cells, and dendritic cells.

Immune System

By the year 2050, 25 percent of the population of the United States will be 60 years of age or older. The CDC estimates
that 80 percent of those 60 years and older have one or more chronic disease associated with deficiencies of the immune
systems. This loss of immune function with age is called immunosenescence. To treat this growing population, medical
professionals must better understand the aging process.
