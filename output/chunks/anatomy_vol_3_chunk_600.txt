If adequate fluids are not consumed, dehydration results and a personâ€™s body contains too little water to function
correctly. A person who repeatedly vomits or who has diarrhea may become dehydrated, and infants, because their body
mass is so low, can become dangerously dehydrated very quickly. Endurance athletes such as distance runners often become
dehydrated during long races. Dehydration can be a medical emergency, and a dehydrated person may lose consciousness,
become comatose, or die, if his or her body is not rehydrated quickly.

 Regulation of Water Output

Water loss from the body occurs predominantly through the renal system. A person produces an average of 1.5 liters (1.6
quarts) of urine per day. Although the volume of urine varies in response to hydration levels, there is a minimum volume

of urine production required for proper bodily functions.
