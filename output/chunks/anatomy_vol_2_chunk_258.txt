There are twelve cranial nerves, which are designated CNI through CNXII for “Cranial Nerve,” using
Roman numerals for 1 through 12. They can be classified as sensory nerves, motor nerves, or a combination of both,
meaning that the axons in these nerves originate out of sensory ganglia external to the cranium or motor nuclei within the
brain stem. Sensory axons enter the brain to synapse in a nucleus. Motor axons connect to skeletal muscles of the head or
neck. Three of the nerves are solely composed of sensory fibers; five are strictly motor; and the remaining four are mixed
nerves.

 Learning the cranial nerves is a tradition in anatomy courses, and students have always used mnemonic devices to
remember the nerve names. A traditional mnemonic is the rhyming couplet, “On Old Olympus’ Towering Tops/ A Finn And
German Viewed Some Hops,” in which the initial letter of each word corresponds to the initial letter in the name of each
nerve.
