Bicarbonate tends to build up in the erythrocytes, so that there is a greater concentration of bicarbonate in the
erythrocytes than in the surrounding blood plasma. As a result, some of the bicarbonate will leave the erythrocytes and

move down its concentration gradient into the plasma in exchange for chloride (CI) ions. This phenomenon is referred to as
the chloride shift and occurs because by exchanging one negative ion for another negative ion, neither the electrical charge
of the erythrocytes nor that of the blood is altered.

 At the pulmonary capillaries, the chemical reaction that produced bicarbonate (shown above) is reversed, and carbon
dioxide and water are the products. Much of the bicarbonate in the plasma re-enters the erythrocytes in exchange for
chloride ions. Hydrogen ions and bicarbonate ions join to form carbonic acid, which is converted into carbon dioxide and
water by carbonic anhydrase.
