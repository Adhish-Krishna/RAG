An ischemic stroke is the loss of blood flow to an area because vessels are blocked or narrowed. This is often caused by an
embolus, which may be a blood clot or fat deposit. Ischemia may also be the result of thickening of the blood vessel wall,
or a drop in blood volume in the brain known as hypovolemia.

 A related type of CVA is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which is similar to a stroke although it does
not last as long. The diagnostic definition of a stroke includes effects that last at least 24 hours. Any stroke symptoms that
are resolved within a 24-hour period because of restoration of adequate blood flow are classified as a TIA.

 A hemorrhagic stroke is bleeding into the brain because of a damaged blood vessel. Accumulated blood fills a region
of the cranial vault and presses against the tissue in the brain (Figure 16.3).
