On the posterior sacrum, the median sacral crest is derived from the fused spinous processes,
and the lateral sacral crest results from the fused transverse processes. The sacral canal contains the sacral spinal nerves, which
exit via the anterior (ventral) and posterior (dorsal) sacral foramina. The sacral promontory is the anterior lip. The sacrum also
forms the posterior portion of the pelvis. 36 An intervertebral disc fills in the space between adjacent vertebrae, where it provides
padding and weight-bearing ability, and allows for movements between the vertebrae. It consists of an outer anulus fibrosus and
an inner nucleus pulposus. The anulus fibrosus strongly anchors the adjacent vertebrae to each other, and the high water content of
the nucleus pulposus resists compression for weight bearing and can change shape to allow for vertebral column movements. 37
The anterior longitudinal ligament is attached to the vertebral bodies on the anterior side of the vertebral column.
