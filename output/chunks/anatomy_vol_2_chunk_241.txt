The CSF is then reabsorbed into the blood at the arachnoid granulations, where the arachnoid membrane
emerges into the dural sinuses.

As the telencephalon enlarges and grows into the cranial cavity, it is limited by the space within the skull. The
telencephalon is the most anterior region of what was the neural tube, but cannot grow past the limit of the frontal bone of
the skull. Because the cerebrum fits into this space, it takes on a C-shaped formation, through the frontal, parietal, occipital,
and finally temporal regions. The space within the telencephalon is stretched into this same C-shape. The two ventricles are
in the left and right sides, and were at one time referred to as the first and second ventricles. The interventricular foramina
connect the frontal region of the lateral ventricles with the third ventricle.

 The third ventricle is the space bounded by the medial walls of the hypothalamus and thalamus.
