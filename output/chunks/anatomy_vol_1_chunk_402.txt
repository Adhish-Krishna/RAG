Figure 4.8 Summary of Epithelial Tissue Cells

Air sacs of lungs and the lining
of the heart, blood vessels,
and lymphatic vessels

In ducts and secretory portions
of small glands and in kidney
tubules

Ciliated tissues are in bronchi,
uterine tubes, and uterus;
smooth (nonciliated tissues)
are in the digestive tract,
bladder

Ciliated tissue lines the trachea
and much of the upper
respiratory tract

Lines the esophagus, mouth,
and vagina

Sweat glands, salivary glands,
and the mammary glands

The male urethra and the

ducts of some glands

Lines the bladder, uretha, and
the ureters

Allows materials to pass
through by diffusion and
filtration, and secretes
lubricating substance

Secretes and absorbs

Absorbs; it also secretes
mucous and enzymes

Secretes mucus; ciliated tissue
moves mucus

Protects against abrasion

Protective tissue

Secretes and protects

Allows the urinary organs to
expand and stretch
