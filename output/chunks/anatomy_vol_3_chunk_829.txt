Normal amniotic fluid is clear and watery, but amniotic fluid in which meconium has been passed is stained
greenish or yellowish. Antibiotics given to the mother may reduce the incidence of maternal bacterial infections, but it
is critical that meconium is aspirated from the newborn before the first breath. Under these conditions, an obstetrician
will extensively aspirate the infant’s airways as soon as the head is delivered, while the rest of the infant’s body is still
inside the birth canal.

 Aspiration of meconium with the first breath can result in labored breathing, a barrel-shaped chest, or a low Apgar
score. An obstetrician can identify meconium aspiration by listening to the lungs with a stethoscope for a coarse rattling
sound. Blood gas tests and chest X-rays of the infant can confirm meconium aspiration. Inhaled meconium after birth
could obstruct a newborn’s airways leading to alveolar collapse, interfere with surfactant function by stripping it from
the lungs, or cause pulmonary inflammation or hypertension.
