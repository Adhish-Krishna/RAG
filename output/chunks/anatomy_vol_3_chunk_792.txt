As the blastocyst forms, the trophoblast excretes enzymes that begin to degrade the zona pellucida. In a process called
“hatching,” the conceptus breaks free of the zona pellucida in preparation for implantation.

 Implantation

At the end of the first week, the blastocyst comes in contact with the uterine wall and adheres to it, embedding itself in the
uterine lining via the trophoblast cells. Thus begins the process of implantation, which signals the end of the pre-embryonic
stage of development (Figure 28.5). Implantation can be accompanied by minor bleeding. The blastocyst typically implants
in the fundus of the uterus or on the posterior wall. However, if the endometrium is not fully developed and ready to receive
the blastocyst, the blastocyst will detach and find a better spot.
