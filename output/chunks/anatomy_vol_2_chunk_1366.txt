Acute inflammation is a short-term inflammatory response to an insult to the body. If the cause of the
inflammation is not resolved, however, it can lead to chronic inflammation, which is associated with major tissue destruction
and fibrosis. Chronic inflammation is ongoing inflammation. It can be caused by foreign bodies, persistent pathogens, and
autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

 There are four important parts to the inflammatory response:

* Tissue Injury. The released contents of injured cells stimulate the release of mast cell granules and their potent
inflammatory mediators such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins. Histamine increases the diameter o
local blood vessels (vasodilation), causing an increase in blood flow. Histamine also increases the permeability o
local capillaries, causing plasma to leak out and form interstitial fluid. This causes the swelling associated with
inflammation.
 Additionally, injured cells, phagocytes, and basophils are sources of inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandins
and leukotrienes.
