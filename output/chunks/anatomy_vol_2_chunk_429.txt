The integrative and associate functions of the prefrontal
lobe feed into the secondary motor areas, which help plan movements. The premotor cortex and supplemental motor area
then feed into the primary motor cortex that initiates movements. Large Betz cells project through the corticobulbar and
corticospinal tracts to synapse on lower motor neurons in the brain stem and ventral horn of the spinal cord, respectively.
 These connections are responsible for generating movements of skeletal muscles.

 The extrapyramidal system includes projections from the brain stem and higher centers that influence movement,
mostly to maintain balance and posture, as well as to maintain muscle tone. The superior colliculus and red nucleus
in the midbrain, the vestibular nuclei in the medulla, and the reticular formation throughout the brain stem each have
tracts projecting to the spinal cord in this system. Descending input from the secondary motor cortices, basal nuclei, and
cerebellum connect to the origins of these tracts in the brain stem.
