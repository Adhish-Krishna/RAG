Of course,
it is often sweetened so that the sour taste is masked.

 The first two tastes (salty and sour) are triggered by the cations Na’ and H”. The other tastes result from food
molecules binding to a G protein-coupled receptor. A G protein signal transduction system ultimately leads to
depolarization of the gustatory cell. The sweet taste is the sensitivity of gustatory cells to the presence of glucose
dissolved in the saliva. Other monosaccharides such as fructose, or artificial sweeteners such as aspartame (NutraSweet™),
saccharine, or sucralose (Splenda™) also activate the sweet receptors. The affinity for each of these molecules varies, and
some will taste sweeter than glucose because they bind to the G protein—coupled receptor differently.

 Bitter taste is similar to sweet in that food molecules bind to G protein-coupled receptors. However, there are a number
of different ways in which this can happen because there are a large diversity of bitter-tasting molecules.
