Due to the extensive knowledge and understanding of excavation techniques, a forensic anthropologist is an
integral and invaluable team member to have on-site when investigating a crime scene, especially when the recovery
of human skeletal remains is involved. When remains are bought to a forensic anthropologist for examination, he or
she must first determine whether the remains are in fact human. Once the remains have been identified as belonging to
a person and not to an animal, the next step is to approximate the individual’s age, sex, race, and height. The forensic
anthropologist does not determine the cause of death, but rather provides information to the forensic pathologist, who
will use all of the data collected to make a final determination regarding the cause of death.
