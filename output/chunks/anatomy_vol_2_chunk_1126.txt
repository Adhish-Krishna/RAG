The outer layers of the tunica externa are not distinct but rather blend with the surrounding connective

tissue outside the vessel, helping to hold the vessel in relative position. If you are able to palpate some of the superficial

veins on your up
not hold the vess:

per limbs and try to move them, you will find that the tunica externa prevents this. If the tunica externa did
el in place, any movement would likely result in disruption of blood flow.

 Arteries

An artery is a blood vessel that conducts blood away from the heart. All arteries have relatively thick walls that can
withstand the high pressure of blood ejected from the heart. However, those close to the heart have the thickest walls,
containing a high percentage of elastic fibers in all three of their tunics. This type of artery is known as an elastic artery
(Figure 20.4). Vessels larger than 10 mm in diameter are typically elastic. Their abundant elastic fibers allow them to
expand, as blood pumped from the ventricles passes through them, and then to recoil after the surge has passed.
