The cells in the stratum basale bond to the dermis via intertwining
collagen fibers, referred to as the basement membrane. A finger-like projection, or fold, known as the dermal papilla
(plural = dermal papillae) is found in the superficial portion of the dermis. Dermal papillae increase the strength of the
connection between the epidermis and dermis; the greater the folding, the stronger the connections made (Figure 5.5).
