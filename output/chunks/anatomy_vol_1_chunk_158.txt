Hydrogen bonds are relatively
weak, and therefore are indicated with a dotted (rather than a solid) line.

 Water molecules also strongly attract other types of charged molecules as well as ions. This explains why “table salt,”
for example, actually is a molecule called a “salt” in chemistry, which consists of equal numbers of positively-charged
sodium (Na*) and negatively-charged chloride (CI’), dissolves so readily in water, in this case forming dipole-ion bonds
between the water and the electrically-charged ions (electrolytes). Water molecules also repel molecules with nonpolar
covalent bonds, like fats, lipids, and oils. You can demonstrate this with a simple kitchen experiment: pour a teaspoon of
vegetable oil, a compound formed by nonpolar covalent bonds, into a glass of water. Instead of instantly dissolving in the
water, the oil forms a distinct bead because the polar water molecules repel the nonpolar oil.
