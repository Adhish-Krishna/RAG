21.7 | Transplantation and Cancer Immunology

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 ¢ Explain why blood typing is important and what happens when mismatched blood is used in a transfusion
¢ Describe how tissue typing is done during organ transplantation and the role of transplant anti-rejection drugs

¢ Show how the immune response is able to control some cancers and how this immune response might be enhanced
by cancer vaccines

The immune responses to transplanted organs and to cancer cells are both important medical issues.
