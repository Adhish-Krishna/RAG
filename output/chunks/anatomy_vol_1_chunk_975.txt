At
fibrous joints, the adjacent bones are directly united to each other by fibrous connective tissue. Similarly, at a cartilaginous
joint, the adjacent bones are united by cartilage. In contrast, at a synovial joint, the articulating bone surfaces are not directly
united to each other, but come together within a fluid-filled joint cavity.

 The functional classification of body joints is based on the degree of movement found at each joint. A synarthrosis is
a joint that is essentially immobile. This type of joint provides for a strong connection between the adjacent bones, which
serves to protect internal structures such as the brain or heart. Examples include the fibrous joints of the skull sutures and
the cartilaginous manubriosternal joint. A joint that allows for limited movement is an amphiarthrosis. An example is the
pubic symphysis of the pelvis, the cartilaginous joint that strongly unites the right and left hip bones of the pelvis.
