This joint is supported on either side by the strong anterior
and posterior sacroiliac ligaments. The right and left hip bones converge anteriorly, where the pubic bodies articulate with each
other to form the pubic symphysis joint. The sacrum is also attached to the hip bone by the sacrospinous ligament, which spans
the sacrum to the ischial spine, and the sacrotuberous ligament, which runs from the sacrum to the ischial tuberosity. The coccyx
is attached to the inferior end of the sacrum. 38 Compared to the male, the female pelvis is wider to accommodate childbirth.
 Thus, the female pelvis has greater distances between the anterior superior iliac spines and between the ischial tuberosities. The
greater width of the female pelvis results in a larger subpubic angle. This angle, formed by the anterior convergence of the right
and left ischiopubic rami, is larger in females (greater than 80 degrees) than in males (less than 70 degrees).
