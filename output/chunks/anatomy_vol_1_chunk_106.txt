1.3 Functions of Human Life

Most processes that occur in the human body are not consciously controlled. They occur continuously to build, maintain,
and sustain life. These processes include: organization, in terms of the maintenance of essential body boundaries;
metabolism, including energy transfer via anabolic and catabolic reactions; responsiveness; movement; and growth,
differentiation, reproduction, and renewal.

 1.4 Requirements for Human Life

Humans cannot survive for more than a few minutes without oxygen, for more than several days without water, and for
more than several weeks without carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, vitamins, and minerals. Although the body can respond to
high temperatures by sweating and to low temperatures by shivering and increased fuel consumption, long-term exposure
to extreme heat and cold is not compatible with survival. The body requires a precise atmospheric pressure to maintain its
gases in solution and to facilitate respirationâ€”the intake of oxygen and the release of carbon dioxide.
