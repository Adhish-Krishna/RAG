The lymphatics are also used to transport dietary lipids and cells of the immune system. Cells of the immune system
all come from the hematopoietic system of the bone marrow. Primary lymphoid organs, the bone marrow and thymus gland,
are the locations where lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system proliferate and mature. Secondary lymphoid organs are
site in which mature lymphocytes congregate to mount immune responses. Many immune system cells use the lymphatic
and circulatory systems for transport throughout the body to search for and then protect against pathogens.

21.2 Barrier Defenses and the Innate Immune Response

Innate immune responses are critical to the early control of infections. Whereas barrier defenses are the bodyâ€™s first line of
physical defense against pathogens, innate immune responses are the first line of physiological defense. Innate responses
occur rapidly, but with less specificity and effectiveness than the adaptive immune response. Innate responses can be caused
by a variety of cells, mediators, and antibacterial proteins such as complement.
