 Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT)

Filtered fluid collected by Bowman’s capsule enters into the PCT. It is called convoluted due to its tortuous path. Simple
cuboidal cells form this tubule with prominent microvilli on the luminal surface, forming a brush border. These microvilli

create a large surface area to maximize the absorption and secretion of solutes (Na’, CI, glucose, etc.), the most essential
function of this portion of the nephron. These cells actively transport ions across their membranes, so they possess a high
concentration of mitochondria in order to produce sufficient ATP.
