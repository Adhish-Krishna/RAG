After studying this chapter, you will be able to:

* Relate the developmental processes of the embryonic nervous system to the adult structures

* Name the major regions of the adult nervous system

* Locate regions of the cerebral cortex on the basis of anatomical landmarks common to all human brains
* Describe the regions of the spinal cord in cross-section

* List the cranial nerves in order of anatomical location and provide the central and peripheral connections
Â¢ List the spinal nerves by vertebral region and by which nerve plexus each supplies

The nervous system is responsible for controlling much of the body, both through somatic (voluntary) and autonomic
(involuntary) functions. The structures of the nervous system must be described in detail to understand how many of these
functions are possible. There is a physiological concept known as localization of function that states that certain structures
are specifically responsible for prescribed functions.
