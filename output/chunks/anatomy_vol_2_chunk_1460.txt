Within the first few days of an infection,
another series of antibacterial proteins are induced, each with activities against certain bacteria, including opsonization of
certain species. Additionally, interferons are induced that protect cells from viruses in their vicinity. Finally, the innate
immune response does not stop when the adaptive immune response is developed. In fact, both can cooperate and one can
influence the other in their responses against pathogens.

 21.3 The Adaptive Immune Response: T lymphocytes and Their Functional Types

T cells recognize antigens with their antigen receptor, a complex of two protein chains on their surface. They do not
recognize self-antigens, however, but only processed antigen presented on their surfaces in a binding groove of a major
histocompatibility complex molecule. T cells develop in the thymus, where they learn to use self-MHC molecules to
recognize only foreign antigens, thus making them tolerant to self-antigens.
