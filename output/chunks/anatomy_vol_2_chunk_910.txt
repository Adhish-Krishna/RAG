These are medical emergencies.

 Among the many known biochemical activities of aspirin is its role as an anticoagulant. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is
very effective at inhibiting the aggregation of platelets. It is routinely administered during a heart attack or stroke to reduce
the adverse effects. Physicians sometimes recommend that patients at risk for cardiovascular disease take a low dose of
aspirin on a daily basis as a preventive measure. However, aspirin can also lead to serious side effects, including increasing
the risk of ulcers. A patient is well advised to consult a physician before beginning any aspirin regimen.

 A class of drugs collectively known as thrombolytic agents can help speed up the degradation of an abnormal
clot. If a thrombolytic agent is administered to a patient within 3 hours following a thrombotic stroke, the patientâ€™s
prognosis improves significantly. However, some strokes are not caused by thrombi, but by hemorrhage. Thus, the cause
must be determined before treatment begins. Tissue plasminogen activator is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of
plasminogen to plasmin, the primary enzyme that breaks down clots.
