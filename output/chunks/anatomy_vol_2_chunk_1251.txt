Although it does branch
and supply blood to the region near the head of the humerus (via the humeral circumflex arteries), the majority of the
vessel continues into the upper arm, or brachium, and becomes the brachial artery (Figure 20.31). The brachial artery
supplies blood to much of the brachial region and divides at the elbow into several smaller branches, including the deep
brachial arteries, which provide blood to the posterior surface of the arm, and the ulnar collateral arteries, which supply
blood to the region of the elbow. As the brachial artery approaches the coronoid fossa, it bifurcates into the radial and ulnar
arteries, which continue into the forearm, or antebrachium. The radial artery and ulnar artery parallel their namesake
bones, giving off smaller branches until they reach the wrist, or carpal region. At this level, they fuse to form the superficial
and deep palmar arches that supply blood to the hand, as well as the digital arteries that supply blood to the digits.
