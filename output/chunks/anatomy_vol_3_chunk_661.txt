Her parent’s reproductive behavior had to facilitate the transfer of male gametes—the sperm—to
the female reproductive tract at just the right time to encounter the female gamete, an oocyte (egg). Finally, combination

of the gametes (fertilization) had to occur, followed by implantation and development. In this chapter, you will explore the
male and female reproductive systems, whose healthy functioning can culminate in the powerful sound of a newborn’s first
cry.

 27.1 | Anatomy and Physiology of the Male Reproductive
System

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the structure and function of the organs of the male reproductive system
¢ Describe the structure and function of the sperm cell
¢ Explain the events during spermatogenesis that produce haploid sperm from diploid cells
¢ Identify the importance of testosterone in male reproductive function

Unique for its role in human reproduction, a gamete is a specialized sex cell carrying 23 chromosomes—one half the
number in body cells.
