Figure 27.2 Male Reproductive System The structures of the male reproductive system include the testes, the
epididymides, the penis, and the ducts and glands that produce and carry semen. Sperm exit the scrotum through the
ductus deferens, which is bundled in the spermatic cord. The seminal vesicles and prostate gland add fluids to the
sperm to create semen.

 Scrotum

The testes are located in a skin-covered, highly pigmented, muscular sack called the scrotum that extends from the body
behind the penis (see Figure 27.2).
