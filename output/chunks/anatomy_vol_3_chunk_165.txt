Intrinsic innervation of much of the alimentary canal is provided by the enteric nervous system, which runs from the
esophagus to the anus, and contains approximately 100 million motor, sensory, and interneurons (unique to this system
compared to all other parts of the peripheral nervous system). These enteric neurons are grouped into two plexuses. The
myenteric plexus (plexus of Auerbach) lies in the muscularis layer of the alimentary canal and is responsible for motility,
especially the rhythm and force of the contractions of the muscularis. The submucosal plexus (plexus of Meissner) lies in
the submucosal layer and is responsible for regulating digestive secretions and reacting to the presence of food (see Figure
23.3).

 Extrinsic innervations of the alimentary canal are provided by the autonomic nervous system, which includes both
sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. In general, sympathetic activation (the fight-or-flight response) restricts the
activity of enteric neurons, thereby decreasing GI secretion and motility.
