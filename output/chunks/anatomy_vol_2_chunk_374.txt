The system contributes to controlling
head and neck movements in response to vestibular signals. An important function of the vestibular system is coordinating
eye and head movements to maintain visual attention. Most of the axons terminate in the vestibular nuclei of the medulla.

CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 585

Some axons project from the vestibular ganglion directly to the cerebellum, with no intervening synapse in the vestibular
nuclei. The cerebellum is primarily responsible for initiating movements on the basis of equilibrium information.

 Neurons in the vestibular nuclei project their axons to targets in the brain stem. One target is the reticular formation,
which influences respiratory and cardiovascular functions in relation to body movements. A second target of the axons of
neurons in the vestibular nuclei is the spinal cord, which initiates the spinal reflexes involved with posture and balance.
