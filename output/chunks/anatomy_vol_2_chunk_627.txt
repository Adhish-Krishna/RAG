Testing conjugate gaze is as simple as having the patient follow a visual target,
like a pen tip, through the visual field ending with an approach toward the face to test convergence and accommodation.
 Along with the vestibular functions of the eighth nerve, the vestibulo-ocular reflex stabilizes gaze during head movements
by coordinating equilibrium sensations with the eye movement systems.
 The trigeminal nerve controls the muscles of chewing, which are tested for stretch reflexes. Motor functions of the
acial nerve are usually obvious if facial expressions are compromised, but can be tested by having the patient raise their
eyebrows, smile, and frown. Movements of the tongue, soft palate, or superior pharynx can be observed directly while
the patient swallows, while the gag reflex is elicited, or while the patient says repetitive consonant sounds. The motor
control of the gag reflex is largely controlled by fibers in the vagus nerve and constitutes a test of that nerve because the
parasympathetic functions of that nerve are involved in visceral regulation, such as regulating the heartbeat and digestion.
