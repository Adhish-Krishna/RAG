The

anterior cruciate ligament resists hyperextension of the knee, while the posterior cruciate ligament prevents
of the femur, thus supporting the knee when it is flexed and weight

bearing. The medial and lateral menisci,

anterior sliding
located between

the femoral and tibial condyles, are articular discs that provide padding and improve the fit between the bones.

 The talocrural joint forms the ankle. It consists of the articul

ation between the talus bone and the medial malleolus

of the tibia, the distal end of the tibia, and the lateral malleolus of the fibula. This is a uniaxial hinge joint that allows

only dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of the foot. Gliding motions at the subtalar and intertarsal joints of thi
inversion/eversion of the foot. The ankle joint is supported on the medial side by the deltoid ligament, whic
to-side motions of the talus at the talocrural joint and resists excessive eversion of the foot.
