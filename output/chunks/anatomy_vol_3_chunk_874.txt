This body of knowledge can help scientists and medical professionals to predict, or at least estimate,
some of the features that an offspring will inherit by examining the genotypes or phenotypes of the parents. One important
application of this knowledge is to identify an individual’s risk for certain heritable genetic disorders. However, most
diseases have a multigenic pattern of inheritance and can also be affected by the environment, so examining the genotypes
or phenotypes of a person’s parents will provide only limited information about the risk of inheriting a disease. Only for a

handful of single-gene disorders can genetic testing allow clinicians to calculate the probability with which a child born to
the two parents tested may inherit a specific disease.
