The dorsal surface of the heart lies near the bodies of the vertebrae, and its anterior surface
sits deep to the sternum and costal cartilages. The great veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae, and the great arteries,
the aorta and pulmonary trunk, are attached to the superior surface of the heart, called the base. The base of the heart is
located at the level of the third costal cartilage, as seen in Figure 19.2. The inferior tip of the heart, the apex, lies just to the
left of the sternum between the junction of the fourth and fifth ribs near their articulation with the costal cartilages. The right
side of the heart is deflected anteriorly, and the left side is deflected posteriorly. It is important to remember the position
and orientation of the heart when placing a stethoscope on the chest of a patient and listening for heart sounds, and also
when looking at images taken from a midsagittal perspective.
