Sound localization is a feature of central processing in the auditory nuclei of the brain stem. Sound localization
is achieved by the brain calculating the interaural time difference and the interaural intensity difference. A sound
originating from a specific location will arrive at each ear at different times, unless the sound is directly in front of the
listener. If the sound source is slightly to the left of the listener, the sound will arrive at the left ear microseconds before it
arrives at the right ear (Figure 14.20). This time difference is an example of an interaural time difference. Also, the sound
will be slightly louder in the left ear than in the right ear because some of the sound waves reaching the opposite ear are
blocked by the head. This is an example of an interaural intensity difference.
