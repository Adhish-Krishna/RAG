There are two basic reasons that orthostatic hypotension can occur. First, blood volume is too low and the
sympathetic reflex is not effective. This hypovolemia may be the result of dehydration or medications that affect
fluid balance, such as diuretics or vasodilators. Both of these medications are meant to lower blood pressure, which
may be necessary in the case of systemic hypertension, and regulation of the medications may alleviate the problem.
 Sometimes increasing fluid intake or water retention through salt intake can improve the situation.

 The second underlying cause of orthostatic hypotension is autonomic failure. There are several disorders that
result in compromised sympathetic functions. The disorders range from diabetes to multiple system atrophy (a loss of
control over many systems in the body), and addressing the underlying condition can improve the hypotension. For
example, with diabetes, peripheral nerve damage can occur, which would affect the postganglionic sympathetic fibers.
Getting blood glucose levels under control can improve neurological deficits associated with diabetes.
