Acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, turned out to be a new disease caused by the previously unknown
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although nearly 100 percent fatal in those with active HIV infections in the early
years, the development of anti-HIV drugs has transformed HIV infection into a chronic, manageable disease and not the
certain death sentence it once was. One positive outcome resulting from the emergence of HIV disease was that the public’s
attention became focused as never before on the importance of having a functional and healthy immune system.

21.1 | Anatomy of the Lymphatic and Immune Systems

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 ¢ Describe the structure and function of the lymphatic tissue (lymph fluid, vessels, ducts, and organs)
 ¢ Describe the structure and function of the primary and secondary lymphatic organs

* Discuss the cells of the immune system, how they function, and their relationship with the lymphatic system

The immune system is the complex collection of cells and organs that destroys or neutralizes pathogens that would
otherwise cause disease or death.
