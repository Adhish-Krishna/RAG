The result is often a heart attack or stroke. Hypertension may also lead to an aneurism (ballooning of a
blood vessel caused by a weakening of the wall), peripheral arterial disease (obstruction of vessels in peripheral regions of
the body), chronic kidney disease, or heart failure.

Listen to this CDC podcast (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/CDCpodcast) to learn about hypertension, often described
as a “silent killer.” What steps can you take to reduce your risk of a heart attack or stroke?

 Hemorrhage

Minor blood loss is managed by hemostasis and repair. Hemorrhage is a loss of blood that cannot be controlled by
hemostatic mechanisms. Initially, the body responds to hemorrhage by initiating mechanisms aimed at increasing blood
pressure and maintaining blood flow. Ultimately, however, blood volume will need to be restored, either through
physiological processes or through medical intervention.

 In response to blood loss, stimuli from the baroreceptors trigger the cardiovascular centers to stimulate sympathetic
responses to increase cardiac output and vasoconstriction.
