 Neural Regulation

The nervous system plays a critical role in the regulation of vascular homeostasis. The primary regulatory sites include the
cardiovascular centers in the brain that control both cardiac and vascular functions. In addition, more generalized neural
responses from the limbic system and the autonomic nervous system are factors.
