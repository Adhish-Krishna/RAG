Cutaneous membrane, or the
skin, covers the body surface.

 Synovial membranes line joint
cavities and produce the fluid
within the joint.

 Figure 4.4 Tissue Membranes The two broad categories of tissue membranes in the body are (1) connective tissue
membranes, which include synovial membranes, and (2) epithelial membranes, which include mucous membranes,
serous membranes, and the cutaneous membrane, in other words, the skin.

 Connective Tissue Membranes

The connective tissue membrane is formed solely from connective tissue. These membranes encapsulate organs, such as
the kidneys, and line our movable joints. A synovial membrane is a type of connective tissue membrane that lines the
cavity of a freely movable joint. For example, synovial membranes surround the joints of the shoulder, elbow, and knee.
 Fibroblasts in the inner layer of the synovial membrane release hyaluronan into the joint cavity. The hyaluronan effectively
traps available water to form the synovial fluid, a natural lubricant that enables the bones of a joint to move freely against
one another without much friction.
