When the blood
glucose concentration falls below that certain point, new glucose is synthesized by the liver to raise the blood concentration
to normal.

 Gluconeogenesis is not simply the reverse of glycolysis. There are some important differences (Figure 24.10).
 Pyruvate is a common starting material for gluconeogenesis. First, the pyruvate is converted into oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate
then serves as a substrate for the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), which transforms oxaloacetate
into phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). From this step, gluconeogenesis is nearly the reverse of glycolysis. PEP is converted
back into 2-phosphoglycerate, which is converted into 3-phosphoglycerate. Then, 3-phosphoglycerate is converted into
1,3 bisphosphoglycerate and then into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Two molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate then
combine to form fructose-1-6-bisphosphate, which is converted into fructose 6-phosphate and then into
glucose-6-phosphate.
