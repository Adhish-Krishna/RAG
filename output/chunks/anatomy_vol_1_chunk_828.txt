Muscles of the posterior leg attach to this line.
 The large expansion found on the medial side of the distal tibia is the medial malleolus (“little hammer”). This forms
the large bony bump found on the medial side of the ankle region. Both the smooth surface on the inside of the medial
malleolus and the smooth area at the distal end of the tibia articulate with the talus bone of the foot as part of the ankle joint.
 On the lateral side of the distal tibia is a wide groove called the fibular notch. This area articulates with the distal end of
the fibula, forming the distal tibiofibular joint.

 Fibula

The fibula is the slender bone located on the lateral side of the leg (see Figure 8.18). The fibula does not bear weight. It
serves primarily for muscle attachments and thus is largely surrounded by muscles. Only the proximal and distal ends of the
fibula can be palpated.

The head of the fibula is the small, knob-like, proximal end of the fibula.
