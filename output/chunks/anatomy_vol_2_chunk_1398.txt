In the process of clonal anergy,
however, B cells exposed to soluble antigen in the bone marrow are not physically deleted, but become unable to function.

 Another mechanism called peripheral tolerance is a direct result of T cell tolerance. In peripheral tolerance,
functional, mature B cells leave the bone marrow but have yet to be exposed to self-antigen. Most protein antigens require
signals from helper T cells (Th2) to proceed to make antibody. When a B cell binds to a self-antigen but receives no signals
from a nearby Th2 cell to produce antibody, the cell is signaled to undergo apoptosis and is destroyed. This is yet another
example of the control that T cells have over the adaptive immune response.

 After B cells are activated by their binding to antigen, they differentiate into plasma cells. Plasma cells often leave
the secondary lymphoid organs, where the response is generated, and migrate back to the bone marrow, where the whole
differentiation process started.
