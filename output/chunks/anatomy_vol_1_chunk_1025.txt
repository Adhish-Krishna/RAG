The
myosin then pulls the actin filaments toward the center, shortening the muscle fiber.

 In skeletal muscle, this sequence begins with signals from the somatic motor division of the nervous system. In other
words, the “excitation” step in skeletal muscles is always triggered by signaling from the nervous system (Figure 10.6).
