Saltatory conduction is faster than
continuous conduction, meaning that myelinated axons propagate their signals faster. The diameter of the axon also makes
a difference as ions diffusing within the cell have less resistance in a wider space.

12.5 Communication Between Neurons

The basis of the electrical signal within a neuron is the action potential that propagates down the axon. For a neuron to
generate an action potential, it needs to receive input from another source, either another neuron or a sensory stimulus. That
input will result in opening ion channels in the neuron, resulting in a graded potential based on the strength of the stimulus.
 Graded potentials can be depolarizing or hyperpolarizing and can summate to affect the probability of the neuron reaching
threshold.

 Graded potentials can be the result of sensory stimuli. If the sensory stimulus is received by the dendrites of a
unipolar sensory neuron, such as the sensory neuron ending in the skin, the graded potential is called a generator potential
because it can directly generate the action potential in the initial segment of the axon.
