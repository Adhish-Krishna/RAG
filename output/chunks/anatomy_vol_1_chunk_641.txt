On the lateral side of the brain case, above the level of the zygomatic arch, is a shallow space called the temporal
fossa. Below the level of the zygomatic arch and deep to the vertical portion of the mandible is another space called the
infratemporal fossa. Both the temporal fossa and infratemporal fossa contain muscles that act on the mandible during
chewing.
