Parasympathetic preganglionic fibers primarily influence the heart, bronchi, and esophagus in the thoracic cavity and the
stomach, liver, pancreas, gall bladder, and small intestine of the abdominal cavity. The postganglionic fibers from the
ganglia activated by the vagus nerve are often incorporated into the structure of the organ, such as the mesenteric plexus
of the digestive tract organs and the intramural ganglia.
