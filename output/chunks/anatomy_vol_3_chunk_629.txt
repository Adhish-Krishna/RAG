Figure 26.16 Respiratory Regulation of Blood pH_ The respiratory system can reduce blood pH by removing CO2
from the blood.

 The chemical reactions that regulate the levels of CO2 and carbonic acid occur in the lungs when blood travels through
the lung’s pulmonary capillaries. Minor adjustments in breathing are usually sufficient to adjust the pH of the blood by
changing how much CO? is exhaled. In fact, doubling the respiratory rate for less than 1 minute, removing “extra” CO2,
would increase the blood pH by 0.2.
