This
surface tension tends to inhibit expansion of the alveoli. However, pulmonary surfactant secreted by type II alveolar cells
mixes with that water and helps reduce this surface tension. Without pulmonary surfactant, the alveoli would collapse during
expiration.

CHAPTER 22 | THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 991

Thoracic wall compliance is the ability of the thoracic wall to stretch while under pressure. This can also affect the
effort expended in the process of breathing. In order for inspiration to occur, the thoracic cavity must expand. The expansion
of the thoracic cavity directly influences the capacity of the lungs to expand. If the tissues of the thoracic wall are not very
compliant, it will be difficult to expand the thorax to increase the size of the lungs.

 Pulmonary Ventilation

The difference in pressures drives pulmonary ventilation because air flows down a pressure gradient, that is, air flows from
an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure.
