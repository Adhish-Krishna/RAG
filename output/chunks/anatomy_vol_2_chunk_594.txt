Different types of aphasia are named for the particular structures that are damaged. Assessment of the functions of
the sensorium includes praxis and gnosis. The subtests related to these functions depend on multimodal integration, as well
as language-dependent processing.

 The prefrontal cortex contains structures important for planning, judgment, reasoning, and working memory. Damage
to these areas can result in changes to personality, mood, and behavior. The famous case of Phineas Gage suggests a role
for this cortex in personality, as does the outdated practice of prefrontal lobectomy.
