Billions of new cells are
produced in an adult human every day. Only very few cell types in the body do not divide, including nerve cells, skeletal
muscle fibers, and cardiac muscle cells. The division time of different cell types varies. Epithelial cells of the skin and
gastrointestinal lining, for instance, divide very frequently to replace those that are constantly being rubbed off of the surface
by friction.

 A DNA molecule is made of two strands that “complement” each other in the sense that the molecules that compose
the strands fit together and bind to each other, creating a double-stranded molecule that looks much like a long, twisted
ladder. Each side rail of the DNA ladder is composed of alternating sugar and phosphate groups (Figure 3.23). The two
sides of the ladder are not identical, but are complementary. These two backbones are bonded to each other across pairs 0
protruding bases, each bonded pair forming one “rung,” or cross member.
