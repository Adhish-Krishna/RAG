Instead, it makes the food smaller to increase both surface area and
mobility. It includes mastication, or chewing, as well as tongue movements that help break food into smaller bits and
mix food with saliva. Although there may be a tendency to think that mechanical digestion is limited to the first steps of
the digestive process, it occurs after the food leaves the mouth, as well. The mechanical churning of food in the stomach
serves to further break it apart and expose more of its surface area to digestive juices, creating an acidic “soup” called
chyme. Segmentation, which occurs mainly in the small intestine, consists of localized contractions of circular muscle of
the muscularis layer of the alimentary canal. These contractions isolate small sections of the intestine, moving their contents
back and forth while continuously subdividing, breaking up, and mixing the contents. By moving food back and forth in the
intestinal lumen, segmentation mixes food with digestive juices and facilitates absorption.
