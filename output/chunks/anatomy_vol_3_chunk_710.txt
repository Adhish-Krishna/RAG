Follicles in which the antrum has become large and

ful

ly formed are considered tertiary follicles (or antral follicles). Several follicles reach the tertiary stage at the same time,

and most of these will undergo atresia. The one that does not die will continue to grow and develop until ovulation, when
it will expel its secondary oocyte surrounded by several layers of granulosa cells from the ovary. Keep in mind that most

fol

icles don’t make it to this point. In fact, roughly 99 percent of the follicles in the ovary will undergo atresia, which can

occur at any stage of folliculogenesis.
