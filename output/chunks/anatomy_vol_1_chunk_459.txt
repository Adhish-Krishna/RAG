Some tissues regenerate more readily than others. Epithelial and
connective tissues replace damaged or dead cells from a supply of adult stem cells. Muscle and nervous tissues undergo
either slow regeneration or do not repair at all.

 Age affects all the tissues and organs of the body. Damaged cells do not regenerate as rapidly as in younger people.
 Perception of sensation and effectiveness of response are lost in the nervous system. Muscles atrophy, and bones lose mass
and become brittle. Collagen decreases in some connective tissue, and joints stiffen.
