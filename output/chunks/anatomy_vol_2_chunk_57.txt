Those areas
are distributed all around the brain and the {MRI images would show activity in more than just 10 percent of the brain
(some evidence suggests that about 80 percent of the brain is using energy—based on blood flow to the tissue—during
well-defined tasks similar to the one suggested above). This task does not even include all of the functions the brain
performs. There is no language response, the body is mostly lying still in the MRI machine, and it does not consider
the autonomic functions that would be ongoing in the background.

CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE 477

12.2 | Nervous Tissue

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Describe the basic structure of a neuron
¢ Identify the different types of neurons on the basis of polarity
¢ List the glial cells of the CNS and describe their function
¢ List the glial cells of the PNS and describe their function

Nervous tissue is composed of two types of cells, neurons and glial cells.
