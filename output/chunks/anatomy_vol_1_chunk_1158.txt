Anesthesia and the Tongue Muscles

Before surgery, a patient must be made ready for general anesthesia. The normal homeostatic controls of the body are
put “on hold” so that the patient can be prepped for surgery. Control of respiration must be switched from the patient’s
homeostatic control to the control of the anesthesiologist. The drugs used for anesthesia relax a majority of the body’s
muscles.

 Among the muscles affected during general anesthesia are those that are necessary for breathing and moving the
tongue. Under anesthesia, the tongue can relax and partially or fully block the airway, and the muscles of respiration
may not move the diaphragm or chest wall. To avoid possible complications, the safest procedure to use on a patient is
called endotracheal intubation. Placing a tube into the trachea allows the doctors to maintain a patient’s (open) airway
to the lungs and seal the airway off from the oropharynx.
