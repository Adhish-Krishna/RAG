 6.4 | Bone Formation and Development

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Explain the function of cartilage
¢ List the steps of intramembranous ossification
¢ List the steps of endochondral ossification
¢ Explain the growth activity at the epiphyseal plate
¢ Compare and contrast the processes of modeling and remodeling

In the early stages of embryonic development, the embryo’s skeleton consists of fibrous membranes and hyaline cartilage.
 By the sixth or seventh week of embryonic life, the actual process of bone development, ossification (osteogenesis), begins.
 There are two osteogenic pathways—intramembranous ossification and endochondral ossification—but bone is the same
regardless of the pathway that produces it.

Bone is a replacement tissue; that is, it uses a model tissue on which to lay down its mineral matrix.
