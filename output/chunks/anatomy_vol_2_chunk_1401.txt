Five Classes of Antibodies and their Functions

In general, antibodies have two basic functions. They can act as the B cell antigen receptor or they can be secreted, circulate,
and bind to a pathogen, often labeling it for identification by other forms of the immune response. Of the five antibody
classes, notice that only two can function as the antigen receptor for naive B cells: IgM and IgD (Figure 21.22). Mature
B cells that leave the bone marrow express both IgM and IgD, but both antibodies have the same antigen specificity. Only
IgM is secreted, however, and no other nonreceptor function for IgD has been discovered.
