What are the two mechanisms by which the bones of the body are formed and which bones are
formed by each mechanism?

Craniosynostosis

The premature closure (fusion) of a suture line is a condition called craniosynostosis. This error in the normal
developmental process results in abnormal growth of the skull and deformity of the head. It is produced either by
defects in the ossification process of the skull bones or failure of the brain to properly enlarge. Genetic factors are
involved, but the underlying cause is unknown. It is a relatively common condition, occurring in approximately 1:2000
births, with males being more commonly affected. Primary craniosynostosis involves the early fusion of one cranial
suture, whereas complex craniosynostosis results from the premature fusion of several sutures.

 The early fusion of a suture in primary craniosynostosis prevents any additional enlargement of the cranial bones
and skull along this line. Continued growth of the brain and skull is therefore diverted to other areas of the head,
causing an abnormal enlargement of these regions.
