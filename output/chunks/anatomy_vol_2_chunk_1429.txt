It is worth discussing the biology of this virus, which can lead to the well-known AIDS, so that its full
effects on the immune system can be understood. The virus is transmitted through semen, vaginal fluids, and blood, and
can be caught by risky sexual behaviors and the sharing of needles by intravenous drug users. There are sometimes, but not
always, flu-like symptoms in the first 1 to 2 weeks after infection. This is later followed by seroconversion. The anti-HIV
antibodies formed during seroconversion are the basis for most initial HIV screening done in the United States. Because
seroconversion takes different lengths of time in different individuals, multiple AIDS tests are given months apart to confirm
or eliminate the possibility of infection.

 After seroconversion, the amount of virus circulating in the blood drops and stays at a low level for several years.

 During this time, the levels of CD4* cells, especially helper T cells, decline steadily, until at some point, the immune
response is so weak that opportunistic disease and eventually death result.
