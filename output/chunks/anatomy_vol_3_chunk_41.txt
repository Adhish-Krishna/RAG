22.2 | The Lungs

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Describe the overall function of the lung
¢ Summarize the blood flow pattern associated with the lungs
* Outline the anatomy of the blood supply to the lungs
¢ Describe the pleura of the lungs and their function

A major organ of the respiratory system, each lung houses structures of both the conducting and respiratory zones. The
main function of the lungs is to perform the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide with air from the atmosphere. To this
end, the lungs exchange respiratory gases across a very large epithelial surface area—about 70 square meters—that is highly
permeable to gases.

 Gross Anatomy of the Lungs

The lungs are pyramid-shaped, paired organs that are connected to the trachea by the right and left bronchi; on the inferior
surface, the lungs are bordered by the diaphragm.
