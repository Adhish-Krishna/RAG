The cross extensor reflex provides a counterbalancing movement on the other side of the body, which
requires another collateral of the sensory axon to activate contraction of the extensor muscles in the contralateral limb.

 A more complex example of somatic function is conscious muscle movement. For example, reading of this text starts
with visual sensory input to the retina, which then projects to the thalamus, and on to the cerebral cortex. A sequence of
regions of the cerebral cortex process the visual information, starting in the primary visual cortex of the occipital lobe,
and resulting in the conscious perception of these letters. Subsequent cognitive processing results in understanding of the
content. As you continue reading, regions of the cerebral cortex in the frontal lobe plan how to move the eyes to follow
the lines of text. The output from the cortex causes activity in motor neurons in the brain stem that cause movement of the
extraocular muscles through the third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves.
