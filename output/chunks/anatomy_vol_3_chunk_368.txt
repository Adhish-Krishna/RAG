Phospholipid

Figure 24.12 Chylomicrons Chylomicrons contain triglycerides, cholesterol molecules, and other apolipoproteins
(protein molecules). They function to carry these water-insoluble molecules from the intestine, through the lymphatic
system, and into the bloodstream, which carries the lipids to adipose tissue for storage.

 Lipolysis

To obtain energy from fat, triglycerides must first be broken down by hydrolysis into their two principal components, fatty
acids and glycerol. This process, called lipolysis, takes place in the cytoplasm. The resulting fatty acids are oxidized by B-
oxidation into acetyl CoA, which is used by the Krebs cycle. The glycerol that is released from triglycerides after lipolysis
directly enters the glycolysis pathway as DHAP.
