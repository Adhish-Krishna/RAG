¢ Discuss the process of bone formation and development

¢ Explain how bone repairs itself after a fracture

¢ Discuss the effect of exercise, nutrition, and hormones on bone tissue
¢ Describe how an imbalance of calcium can affect bone tissue

Bones make good fossils. While the soft tissue of a once living organism will decay and fall away over time, bone tissue
will, under the right conditions, undergo a process of mineralization, effectively turning the bone to stone. A well-preserved


204 CHAPTER 6 | BONE TISSUE AND THE SKELETAL SYSTEM

fossil skeleton can give us a good sense of the size and shape of an organism, just as your skeleton helps to define your size
and shape. Unlike a fossil skeleton, however, your skeleton is a structure of living tissue that grows, repairs, and renews
itself. The bones within it are dynamic and complex organs that serve a number of important functions, including some
necessary to maintain homeostasis.
