In males, FSH stimulates sperm maturation, which is inhibited by the hormone inhibin. The steroid hormone
testosterone, a type of androgen, is released in response to LH and is responsible for the maturation and maintenance of
the male reproductive system, as well as the development of male secondary sex characteristics. In females, FSH promotes
egg maturation and LH signals the secretion of the female sex hormones, the estrogens and progesterone. Both of these
hormones are important in the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system, as well as maintaining
pregnancy. The placenta develops during early pregnancy, and secretes several hormones important for maintaining the
pregnancy.

17.9 The Endocrine Pancreas

The pancreas has both exocrine and endocrine functions. The pancreatic islet cell types include alpha cells, which produce
glucagon; beta cells, which produce insulin; delta cells, which produce somatostatin; and PP cells, which produce pancreatic
polypeptide.
