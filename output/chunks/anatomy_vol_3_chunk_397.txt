Because glucose levels are very low during starvation, glycolysis will
shut off in cells that can use alternative fuels. For example, muscles will switch from using glucose to fatty acids as fuel.
 As previously explained, fatty acids can be converted into acetyl CoA and processed through the Krebs cycle to make ATP.
 Pyruvate, lactate, and alanine from muscle cells are not converted into acetyl CoA and used in the Krebs cycle, but are
exported to the liver to be used in the synthesis of glucose. As starvation continues, and more glucose is needed, glycerol
from fatty acids can be liberated and used as a source for gluconeogenesis.

 After several days of starvation, ketone bodies become the major source of fuel for the heart and other organs. As
starvation continues, fatty acids and triglyceride stores are used to create ketones for the body. This prevents the continued
breakdown of proteins that serve as carbon sources for gluconeogenesis. Once these stores are fully depleted, proteins from
muscles are released and broken down for glucose synthesis.
