Adenosine diphosphate

Figure 24.2 Structure of ATP Molecule Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the energy molecule of the cell. During
catabolic reactions, ATP is created and energy is stored until needed during anabolic reactions.

 The energy from ATP drives all bodily functions, such as contracting muscles, maintaining the electrical potential of
nerve cells, and absorbing food in the gastrointestinal tract. The metabolic reactions that produce ATP come from various
sources (Figure 24.3).
