Although you may not perceive
it, atmospheric pressure is constantly pressing down on your body. This pressure keeps gases within your body, such as the
gaseous nitrogen in body fluids, dissolved. If you were suddenly ejected from a space ship above Earth’s atmosphere, you
would go from a situation of normal pressure to one of very low pressure. The pressure of the nitrogen gas in your blood
would be much higher than the pressure of nitrogen in the space surrounding your body. As a result, the nitrogen gas in your
blood would expand, forming bubbles that could block blood vessels and even cause cells to break apart.

 Atmospheric pressure does more than just keep blood gases dissolved. Your ability to breathe—that is, to take in
oxygen and release carbon dioxide—also depends upon a precise atmospheric pressure. Altitude sickness occurs in part
because the atmosphere at high altitudes exerts less pressure, reducing the exchange of these gases, and causing shortness of
breath, confusion, headache, lethargy, and nausea.
