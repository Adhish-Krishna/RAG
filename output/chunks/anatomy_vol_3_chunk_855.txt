Closing of the ductus arteriosus ensures that all blood pumped to
the pulmonary circuit will be oxygenated by the newly functional neonatal lungs.

 Thermoregulatory Adjustments

The fetus floats in warm amniotic fluid that is maintained at a temperature of approximately 98.6Â°F with very little
fluctuation. Birth exposes newborns to a cooler environment in which they have to regulate their own body temperature.

New
whic

borns have a higher ratio of surface area to volume than adults. This means that their body has less volume throughout
h to produce heat, and more surface area from which to lose heat. As a result, newborns produce heat more slowly

and lose it more quickly. Newborns also have immature musculature that limits their ability to generate heat by shivering.
 Moreover, their nervous systems are underdeveloped, so they cannot quickly constrict superficial blood vessels in response

to co!

body temperature.
