This step completes the process of fertilization and results in a single-celled diploid
zygote with all the genetic instructions it needs to develop into a human.

 Most of the time, a woman releases a single egg during an ovulation cycle. However, in approximately 1 percent of
ovulation cycles, two eggs are released and both are fertilized. Two zygotes form, implant, and develop, resulting in the
birth of dizygotic (or fraternal) twins. Because dizygotic twins develop from two eggs fertilized by two sperm, they are no
more identical than siblings born at different times.

 Much less commonly, a zygote can divide into two separate offspring during early development. This results in the
birth of monozygotic (or identical) twins. Although the zygote can split as early as the two-cell stage, splitting occurs most
commonly during the early blastocyst stage, with roughly 70-100 cells present.
