While carbohydrates
and lipids are composed of hydrocarbons and oxygen, all proteins also contain nitrogen (N), and many contain sulfur (S),
in addition to carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.

Microstructure of Proteins

Proteins are polymers made up of nitrogen-containing monomers called amino acids. An amino acid is a molecule
composed of an amino group and a carboxyl group, together with a variable side chain. Just 20 different amino acids
contribute to nearly all of the thousands of different proteins important in human structure and function. Body proteins
contain a unique combination of a few dozen to a few hundred of these 20 amino acid monomers. All 20 of these amino
acids share a similar structure (Figure 2.24). All consist of a central carbon atom to which the following are bonded:

¢ ahydrogen atom

¢ an alkaline (basic) amino group NH2 (see Table 2.1)

¢ an acidic carboxyl group COOH (see Table 2.1)

¢ a variable group

Figure 2.24 Structure of an Amino Acid

Notice that all amino acids contain both an acid (the carboxyl group) and a base (the amino group) (amine = “nitrogen-
containing”).
