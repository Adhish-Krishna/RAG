If they both transmit their abnormal
allele, their offspring will develop the disease and will die in childhood, usually before age 5.

Dominant lethal inheritance patterns are much more rare because neither heterozygotes nor homozygotes survive.
 Of course, dominant lethal alleles that arise naturally through mutation and cause miscarriages or stillbirths are never
transmitted to subsequent generations. However, some dominant lethal alleles, such as the allele for Huntington’s disease,
cause a shortened life span but may not be identified until after the person reaches reproductive age and has children.
Huntington’s disease causes irreversible nerve cell degeneration and death in 100 percent of affected individuals, but it may
not be expressed until the individual reaches middle age.
