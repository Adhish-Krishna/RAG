They act to stimulate or inhibit blood flow.
 Some of these are endocrine, acting from a distance, whereas others are paracrine, acting locally.

 Renin-Angiotensin-â€”Aldosterone

Renin is an enzyme that is produced by the granular cells of the afferent arteriole at the JGA. It enzymatically converts
angiotensinogen (made by the liver, freely circulating) into angiotensin I. Its release is stimulated by prostaglandins and NO
rom the JGA in response to decreased extracellular fluid volume.

 ACE is not a hormone but it is functionally important in regulating systemic blood pressure and kidney function. It is
produced in the lungs but binds to the surfaces of endothelial cells in the afferent arterioles and glomerulus. It enzymatically
converts inactive angiotensin | into active angiotensin II. ACE is important in raising blood pressure. People with high
blood pressure are sometimes prescribed ACE inhibitors to lower their blood pressure.
 Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor that plays an immediate role in the regulation of blood pressure.
