2 They are part of the somatic nervous system, which is responsible for voluntary movements such
as walking or climbing the stairs. 3 Neurons enable thought, perception, and movement. Plants do not move, so they do not need
this type of tissue. Microorganisms are too small to have a nervous system. Many are single-celled, and therefore have organelles
for perception and movement. 4Lipid membranes, such as the cell membrane and organelle membranes. 5 Sodium is moving into
the cell because of the immense concentration gradient, whereas potassium is moving out because of the depolarization that sodium
causes. However, they both move down their respective gradients, toward equilibrium. 6 The properties of electrophysiology are
common to all animals, so using the leech is an easier, more humane approach to studying the properties of these cells. There
are differences between the nervous systems of invertebrates (such as a leech) and vertebrates, but not for the sake of what these
experiments study.
