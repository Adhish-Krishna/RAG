The skin and its accessory structures make up the integumentary system,
which provides the body with overall protection. The skin is made of multiple layers of cells and tissues, which are held to
underlying structures by connective tissue (Figure 5.2). The deeper layer of skin is well vascularized (has numerous blood
vessels). It also has numerous sensory, and autonomic and sympathetic nerve fibers ensuring communication to and from
the brain.
