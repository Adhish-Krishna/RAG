Figure 26.6 The Sodium-Potassium Pump The sodium-potassium pump is powered by ATP to transfer sodium out
of the cytoplasm and into the ECF. The pump also transfers potassium out of the ECF and into the cytoplasm. (credit:

Fluid Movement between Compartments

Hydrostatic pressure, the force exerted by a fluid against a wall, causes movement of fluid between compartments. The
hydrostatic pressure of blood is the pressure exerted by blood against the walls of the blood vessels by the pumping action
of the heart. In capillaries, hydrostatic pressure (also known as capillary blood pressure) is higher than the opposing “colloid
osmotic pressure” in blood—a “constant” pressure primarily produced by circulating albumin—at the arteriolar end of the
capillary (Figure 26.7).
