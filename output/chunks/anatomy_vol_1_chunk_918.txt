Figure 9.12 Movements of the Body, Part 1 Synovial joints give the body many ways in which to move. (a)—(b)
Flexion and extension motions are in the sagittal (anterior—posterior) plane of motion. These movements take place at
the shoulder, hip, elbow, knee, wrist, metacarpophalangeal, metatarsophalangeal, and interphalangeal joints. (c)—(d)
Anterior bending of the head or vertebral column is flexion, while any posterior-going movement is extension. (e)
Abduction and adduction are motions of the limbs, hand, fingers, or toes in the coronal (medial—lateral) plane of
movement.
