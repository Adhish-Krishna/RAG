For example, when an individual is exercising, more blood will be directed to skeletal muscles, the heart, and the lungs.

862 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION

 Following a meal, more blood is directed to the digestive system. Only the brain receives a more or less constant supply of
blood whether you are active, resting, thinking, or engaged in any other activity.

 Table 20.3 provides the distribution of systemic blood at rest and during exercise. Although most of the data appears
logical, the values for the distribution of blood to the integument may seem surprising. During exercise, the body distributes
more blood to the body surface where it can dissipate the excess heat generated by increased activity into the environment.

Table 20.3

Three homeostatic mechanisms ensure adequate blood flow, blood pressure, distribution, and ultimately perfusion:
neural, endocrine, and autoregulatory mechanisms.
