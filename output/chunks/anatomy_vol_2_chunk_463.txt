The cranial component of the parasympathetic system is based in particular nuclei of the brain stem. In the midbrain,
the Eddingerâ€”Westphal nucleus is part of the oculomotor complex, and axons from those neurons travel with the fibers
in the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) that innervate the extraocular muscles. The preganglionic parasympathetic
fibers within cranial nerve III terminate in the ciliary ganglion, which is located in the posterior orbit. The postganglionic
parasympathetic fibers then project to the smooth muscle of the iris to control pupillary size. In the upper medulla, the
salivatory nuclei contain neurons with axons that project through the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves to ganglia that
control salivary glands. Tear production is influenced by parasympathetic fibers in the facial nerve, which activate a
ganglion, and ultimately the lacrimal (tear) gland. Neurons in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve and the nucleus
ambiguus project through the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) to the terminal ganglia of the thoracic and abdominal cavities.
