The
PET camera reveals to the medical team which of the patient’s tissues are taking up the most glucose. Thus, the most
metabolically active tissues show up as bright “hot spots” on the images (Figure 2.6). PET can reveal some cancerous
masses because cancer cells consume glucose at a high rate to fuel their rapid reproduction.

 Figure 2.6 PET Scan PET highlights areas in the body where there is relatively high glucose use, which is
characteristic of cancerous tissue. This PET scan shows sites of the spread of a large primary tumor to other
sites.

 In the human body, atoms do not exist as independent entities. Rather, they are constantly reacting with other atoms to
form and to break down more complex substances. To fully understand anatomy and physiology you must grasp how atoms
participate in such reactions. The key is understanding the behavior of electrons.
