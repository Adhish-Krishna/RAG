Figure 10.4 Muscle Fiber A skeletal muscle fiber is surrounded by a plasma membrane called the sarcolemma,
which contains sarcoplasm, the cytoplasm of muscle cells. A muscle fiber is composed of many fibrils, which give the
cell its striated appearance.

 The Sarcomere

The striated appearance of skeletal muscle fibers is due to the arrangement of the myofilaments of actin and myosin in
sequential order from one end of the muscle fiber to the other. Each packet of these microfilaments and their regulatory
proteins, troponin and tropomyosin (along with other proteins) is called a sarcomere.
