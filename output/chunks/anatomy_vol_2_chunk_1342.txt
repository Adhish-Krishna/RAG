As the lymph continues to flow through the node, it enters the medulla, which consists
of medullary cords of B cells and plasma cells, and the medullary sinuses where the lymph collects before leaving the node
via the efferent lymphatic vessels.

Spleen

In addition to the lymph nodes, the spleen is a major secondary lymphoid organ (Figure 21.9). It is about 12 cm (5 in) long
and is attached to the lateral border of the stomach via the gastrosplenic ligament. The spleen is a fragile organ without a
strong capsule, and is dark red due to its extensive vascularization. The spleen is sometimes called the “filter of the blood”
because of its extensive vascularization and the presence of macrophages and dendritic cells that remove microbes and other
materials from the blood, including dying red blood cells.
