There are also acquired immunodeficiencies with potentially devastating
effects on the immune system, such as HIV.

 Inherited Immunodeficiencies

A list of all inherited immunodeficiencies is well beyond the scope of this book. The list is almost as long as the list of cells,
proteins, and signaling molecules of the immune system itself. Some deficiencies, such as those for complement, cause
only a higher susceptibility to some Gram-negative bacteria. Others are more severe in their consequences. Certainly, the
most serious of the inherited immunodeficiencies is severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID). This disease is
complex because it is caused by many different genetic defects. What groups them together is the fact that both the B cell
and T cell arms of the adaptive immune response are affected.

 Children with this disease usually die of opportunistic infections within their first year of life unless they receive
a bone marrow transplant. Such a procedure had not yet been perfected for David Vetter, the “boy in the bubble,” who
was treated for SCID by having to live almost his entire life in a sterile plastic cocoon for the 12 years before his death
from infection in 1984.
