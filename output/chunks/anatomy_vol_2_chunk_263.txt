The three eye-movement nerves are all motor: the oculomotor (CNIII), trochlear (CNIV), and abducens (CNVI). The spinal
accessory (CNXI) and hypoglossal (CNXII) nerves are also strictly motor. The remainder of the nerves contain both sensory
and motor fibers. They are the trigeminal (CNV), facial (CNVID), glossopharyngeal (CNIX), and vagus (CNX) nerves. The
nerves that convey both are often related to each other. The trigeminal and facial nerves both concern the face; one concerns
the sensations and the other concerns the muscle movements. The facial and glossopharyngeal nerves are both responsible
for conveying gustatory, or taste, sensations as well as controlling salivary glands. The vagus nerve is involved in visceral
responses to taste, namely the gag reflex. This is not an exhaustive list of what these combination nerves do, but there is a
thread of relation between them.
