CHAPTER 7 | AXIAL SKELETON 257

Middle Cranial Fossa

The middle cranial fossa is deeper and situated posterior to the anterior fossa. It extends from the lesser wings of the
sphenoid bone anteriorly, to the petrous ridges (petrous portion of the temporal bones) posteriorly. The large, diagonally
positioned petrous ridges give the middle cranial fossa a butterfly shape, making it narrow at the midline and broad laterally.
 The temporal lobes of the brain occupy this fossa. The middle cranial fossa is divided at the midline by the upward bony
prominence of the sella turcica, a part of the sphenoid bone. The middle cranial fossa has several openings for the passage
of blood vessels and cranial nerves (see Figure 7.8).
 Openings in the middle cranial fossa are as follows:
* Optic canalâ€”This opening is located at the anterior lateral corner of the sella turcica.
