Bilirubin, the main bile pigment, is a waste product produced when the spleen removes old or damaged red blood cells
from the circulation. These breakdown products, including proteins, iron, and toxic bilirubin, are transported to the liver via
the splenic vein of the hepatic portal system. In the liver, proteins and iron are recycled, whereas bilirubin is excreted in
the bile. It accounts for the green color of bile. Bilirubin is eventually transformed by intestinal bacteria into stercobilin, a
brown pigment that gives your stool its characteristic color! In some disease states, bile does not enter the intestine, resulting
in white (‘acholic’) stool with a high fat content, since virtually no fats are broken down or absorbed.
 Hepatocytes work non-stop, but bile production increases when fatty chyme enters the duodenum and stimulates the
secretion of the gut hormone secretin. Between meals, bile is produced but conserved. The valve-like hepatopancreatic
ampulla closes, allowing bile to divert to the gallbladder, where it is concentrated and stored until the next meal.
