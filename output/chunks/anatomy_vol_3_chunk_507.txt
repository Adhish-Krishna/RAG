Sodium moves down its electrochemical and

concentration gradient into the cell and takes glucose with it. Na” is then actively pumped out of the cell at the basal surface
of the cell into the interstitial space. Glucose leaves the cell to enter the interstitial space by facilitated diffusion. The energy

to move glucose comes from the Na*/K* ATPase that pumps Na’ out of the cell on the basal surface. Fifty percent of Cl”

and variable quantities of Ca**, Mg**, and HPO} ~ are also recovered in the PCT.

 Recovery of bicarbonate (HCO3 ) is vital to the maintenance of acid-base balance, since it is a very powerful and
fast-acting buffer. An important enzyme is used to catalyze this mechanism: carbonic anhydrase (CA). This same enzyme
and reaction is used in red blood cells in the transportation of COz, in the stomach to produce hydrochloric acid, and
in the pancreas to produce HCO3 to buffer acidic chyme from the stomach.
