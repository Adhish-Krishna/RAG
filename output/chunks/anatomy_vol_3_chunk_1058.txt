There are additional negatively charged molecules in plasma besides chloride. The additional sodium balances the total negative
charges. 32 Fluid is moved by a combination of osmotic and hydrostatic pressures. The osmotic pressure results from differences
in solute concentrations across cell membranes. Hydrostatic pressure results from the pressure of blood as it enters a capillary
system, forcing some fluid out of the vessel into the surrounding tissues. 33 ADH constricts the arterioles in the peripheral
circulation, limiting blood to the extremities and increasing the blood supply to the core of the body. ADH also causes the epithelial
cells lining the renal collecting tubules to move water channel proteins called aquaporins from the sides of the cells to the apical
surface. This greatly increases the passage of water from the renal filtrate through the wall of the collecting tubule as well as
the reabsorption of water into the bloodstream.
