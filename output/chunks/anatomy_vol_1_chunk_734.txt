In some cases, parts of the skull
will be removed and replaced with an artificial plate. The earlier after birth that surgery is performed, the better the
outcome. After treatment, most children continue to grow and develop normally and do not exhibit any neurological
problems.

CHAPTER 7| AXIAL SKELETON 275

KEY TERMS
alveolar process of the mandible upper border of mandibular body that contains the lower teeth
alveolar process of the maxilla curved, inferior margin of the maxilla that supports and anchors the upper teeth
angle of the mandible rounded corner located at outside margin of the body and ramus junction

angle of the rib portion of rib with greatest curvature; together, the rib angles form the most posterior extent of the
thoracic cage

sacrum

anterior arch anterior portion of the ring-like C1 (atlas) vertebra

anterior cranial fossa shallowest and most anterior cranial fossa of the cranial base that extends from the frontal bone
to the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone

anterior longitudinal ligament ligament that runs the length of the vertebral column, uniting the anterior aspects of
the vertebral bodies

anulus fibrosus tough, fibrous outer portion of an intervertebral disc, which is strongly anchored to the bodies of the
adjacent vertebrae

appendicular skeleton all bones of the upper and lower limbs, plus the girdle bones that attach each limb to the axial
skeleton

articular tubercle smooth ridge located on the inferior skull, immediately anterior to the mandibular fossa
atlas first cervical (C1) vertebra

axial skeleton central, vertical axis of the body, including the skull, vertebral column, and thoracic cage
axis second cervical (C2) vertebra

body of the rib shaft portion of a rib

brain case portion of the skull that contains and protects the brain, consisting of the eight bones that form the cranial
base and rounded upper skull

calvaria (also, skullcap) rounded top of the skull
carotid canal zig-zag tunnel providing passage through the base of the skull for the internal carotid artery to the brain;
begins anteromedial to the styloid process and terminates in the middle cranial cavity, near the posterior-lateral base

of the sella turcica

cervical curve posteriorly concave curvature of the cervical vertebral column region; a secondary curve of the
vertebral column

cervical vertebrae seven vertebrae numbered as C1—C7 that are located in the neck region of the vertebral column

clavicular notch paired notches located on the superior-lateral sides of the sternal manubrium, for articulation with the
clavicle

coccyx small bone located at inferior end of the adult vertebral column that is formed by the fusion of four coccygeal
vertebrae; also referred to as the “tailbone”

condylar process of the mandible thickened upward projection from posterior margin of mandibular ramus
condyle oval-shaped process located at the top of the condylar process of the mandible
coronal suture joint that unites the frontal bone to the right and left parietal bones across the top of the skull

coronoid process of the mandible flattened upward projection from the anterior margin of the mandibular ramus

276 CHAPTER 7 | AXIAL SKELETON

costal cartilage hyaline cartilage structure attached to the anterior end of each rib that provides for either direct or
indirect attachment of most ribs to the sternum

costal facet site on the lateral sides of a thoracic vertebra for articulation with the head of a rib

costal groove shallow groove along the inferior margin of a rib that provides passage for blood vessels and a nerve
cranial cavity interior space of the skull that houses the brain

cranium skull

cribriform plate small, flattened areas with numerous small openings, located to either side of the midline in the floor
of the anterior cranial fossa; formed by the ethmoid bone

crista galli small upward projection located at the midline in the floor of the anterior cranial fossa; formed by the
ethmoid bone

dens bony projection (odontoid process) that extends upward from the body of the C2 (axis) vertebra
ear ossicles three small bones located in the middle ear cavity that serve to transmit sound vibrations to the inner ear

ethmoid air cell one of several small, air-filled spaces located within the lateral sides of the ethmoid bone, between the
orbit and upper nasal cavity

ethmoid bone unpaired bone that forms the roof and upper, lateral walls of the nasal cavity, portions of the floor of the
anterior cranial fossa and medial wall of orbit, and the upper portion of the nasal septum

external acoustic meatus ear canal opening located on the lateral side of the skull

external occipital protuberance small bump located at the midline on the posterior skull

facet small, flattened area on a bone for an articulation (joint) with another bone, or for muscle attachment

facial bones fourteen bones that support the facial structures and form the upper and lower jaws and the hard palate

false ribs vertebrochondral ribs 8-12 whose costal cartilage either attaches indirectly to the sternum via the costal
cartilage of the next higher rib or does not attach to the sternum at all

floating ribs vertebral ribs 11-12 that do not attach to the sternum or to the costal cartilage of another rib

fontanelle expanded area of fibrous connective tissue that separates the brain case bones of the skull prior to birth and
during the first year after birth

foramen lacerum irregular opening in the base of the skull, located inferior to the exit of carotid canal

foramen magnum large opening in the occipital bone of the skull through which the spinal cord emerges and the
vertebral arteries enter the cranium

foramen ovale of the middle cranial fossa oval-shaped opening in the floor of the middle cranial fossa

foramen rotundum round opening in the floor of the middle cranial fossa, located between the superior orbital fissure
and foramen ovale

foramen spinosum small opening in the floor of the middle cranial fossa, located lateral to the foramen ovale

frontal bone unpaired bone that forms forehead, roof of orbit, and floor of anterior cranial fossa
frontal sinus air-filled space within the frontal bone; most anterior of the paranasal sinuses
glabella slight depression of frontal bone, located at the midline between the eyebrows

greater wings of sphenoid bone lateral projections of the sphenoid bone that form the anterior wall of the middle
cranial fossa and an area of the lateral skull
