Even
more severe peritonitis is associated with bacterial infections seen with appendicitis, colonic diverticulitis, and pelvic
inflammatory disease (infection of uterine tubes, usually by sexually transmitted bacteria). Peritonitis is life threatening
and often results in emergency surgery to correct the underlying problem and intensive antibiotic therapy. When your
great grandparents and even your parents were young, the mortality from peritonitis was high. Aggressive surgery,
improvements in anesthesia safety, the advance of critical care expertise, and antibiotics have greatly improved the
mortality rate from this condition. Even so, the mortality rate still ranges from 30 to 40 percent.

 The visceral peritoneum includes multiple large folds that envelope various abdominal organs, holding them to the
dorsal surface of the body wall. Within these folds are blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves that innervate the organs
with which they are in contact, supplying their adjacent organs.
