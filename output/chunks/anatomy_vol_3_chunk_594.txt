A decrease in the normal levels of plasma proteins results in a decrease of colloid osmotic pressure (which
counterbalances the hydrostatic pressure) in the capillaries. This process causes loss of water from the blood to the
surrounding tissues, resulting in edema.

the tissues. (credit: Jane Whitney)

Mild, transient edema of the feet and legs may be caused by sitting or standing in the same position for long
periods of time, as in the work of a toll collector or a supermarket cashier. This is because deep veins in the lower
limbs rely on skeletal muscle contractions to push on the veins and thus “pump” blood back to the heart. Otherwise,
the venous blood pools in the lower limbs and can leak into surrounding tissues.

 Medications that can result in edema include vasodilators, calcium channel blockers used to treat hypertension,
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, estrogen therapies, and some diabetes medications.
