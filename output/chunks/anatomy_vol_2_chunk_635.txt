The
sensitivity to fine touch, which can give indications of the texture and detailed shape of objects, is highest in the fingertips.
 To assess the limit of this sensitivity, two-point discrimination is measured by simultaneously touching the skin in two
locations, such as could be accomplished with a pair of forceps. Specialized calipers for precisely measuring the distance
between points are also available. The patient is asked to indicate whether one or two stimuli are present while keeping their
eyes closed. The examiner will switch between using the two points and a single point as the stimulus. Failure to recognize
two points may be an indication of a dorsal column pathway deficit.

 Similar to two-point discrimination, but assessing laterality of perception, is double simultaneous stimulation. Two
stimuli, such as the cotton tips of two applicators, are touched to the same position on both sides of the body.
