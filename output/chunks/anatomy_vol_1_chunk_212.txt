Figure 2.23 Other Important Lipids (a) Phospholipids are composed of two fatty acids, glycerol, and a phosphate
group. (b) Sterols are ring-shaped lipids. Shown here is cholesterol. (c) Prostaglandins are derived from unsaturated
fatty acids. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) includes hydroxyl and carboxyl groups.

 Steroids

A steroid compound (referred to as a sterol) has as its foundation a set of four hydrocarbon rings bonded to a variety of
other atoms and molecules (see Figure 2.23b). Although both plants and animals synthesize sterols, the type that makes the
most important contribution to human structure and function is cholesterol, which is synthesized by the liver in humans and
animals and is also present in most animal-based foods.
