Another significant ovarian hormone
is progesterone, which contributes to regulation of the menstrual cycle and is important in preparing the body for pregnancy
as well as maintaining pregnancy. In addition, the granulosa cells of the ovarian follicles produce inhibin, which—as in
males—inhibits the secretion of FSH.During the initial stages of pregnancy, an organ called the placenta develops within
the uterus. The placenta supplies oxygen and nutrients to the fetus, excretes waste products, and produces and secretes
estrogens and progesterone. The placenta produces human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) as well. The hCG hormone
promotes progesterone synthesis and reduces the mother’s immune function to protect the fetus from immune rejection. It
also secretes human placental lactogen (hPL), which plays a role in preparing the breasts for lactation, and relaxin, which is
thought to help soften and widen the pubic symphysis in preparation for childbirth.
