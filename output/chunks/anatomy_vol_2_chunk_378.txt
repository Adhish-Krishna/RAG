A unique clinical presentation that relates to this anatomic arrangement is the loss of lateral peripheral vision, known
as bilateral hemianopia. This is different from “tunnel vision” because the superior and inferior peripheral fields are not
lost. Visual field deficits can be disturbing for a patient, but in this case, the cause is not within the visual system itself. A
growth of the pituitary gland presses against the optic chiasm and interferes with signal transmission. However, the axons
projecting to the same side of the brain are unaffected. Therefore, the patient loses the outermost areas of their field of vision
and cannot see objects to their right and left.

 Extending from the optic chiasm, the axons of the visual system are referred to as the optic tract instead of the optic
nerve. The optic tract has three major targets, two in the diencephalon and one in the midbrain. The connection between
the eyes and diencephalon is demonstrated during development, in which the neural tissue of the retina differentiates from
that of the diencephalon by the growth of the secondary vesicles.
