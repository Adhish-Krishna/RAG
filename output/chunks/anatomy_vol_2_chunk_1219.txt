This includes the
generalized and more specialized functions of transport of materials, capillary exchange, maintaining health by transporting
white blood cells and various immunoglobulins (antibodies), hemostasis, regulation of body temperature, and helping to
maintain acid-base balance. In addition to these shared functions, many systems enjoy a unique relationship with the
circulatory system. Figure 20.22 summarizes these relationships.

872 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION

Digestive Absorbs nutrients and water; delivers nutrients (except most lipids) to
liver for processing by hepatic portal vein; provides nutrients essential
for hematopoiesis and building hemoglobin

Delivers hormones: atrial natriuretic hormone (peptide) secreted by
the heart atrial cells to help regulate blood volumes and pressures;
epinephrine, ANH, angiotensin II, ADH, and thyroxine to help
regulate blood pressure; estrogen to promote vascular health in
women and men

Carries clotting factors, platelets, and white blood cells for
hemostasis, fighting infection, and repairing damage; regulates
temperature by controlling blood flow to the surface, where heat can
be dissipated; provides some coloration of integument; acts as a
blood reservoir

Lymphatic Transports various white blood cells, including those produced by
s lymphatic tissue, and immunoglobulins (antibodies) throughout the
body to maintain health; carries excess tissue fluid not able to be
reabsorbed by the vascular capillaries back to the lymphatic system
for processing

Muscular Provides nutrients and oxygen for contraction; removes lactic acid
and distributes heat generated by contraction; muscular pumps aid in
venous return; exercise contributes to cardiovascular health and
helps to prevent atherosclerosis.
