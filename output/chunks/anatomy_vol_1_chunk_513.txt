Among these changes
are reductions in cell division, metabolic activity, blood circulation, hormonal levels, and muscle strength (Figure
5.17). In the skin, these changes are reflected in decreased mitosis in the stratum basale, leading to a thinner epidermis.
 The dermis, which is responsible for the elasticity and resilience of the skin, exhibits a reduced ability to regenerate,
which leads to slower wound healing. The hypodermis, with its fat stores, loses structure due to the reduction and
redistribution of fat, which in turn contributes to the thinning and sagging of skin.

aging, as it loses its elasticity over time. (credit: Janet Ramsden)

The accessory structures also have lowered activity, generating thinner hair and nails, and reduced amounts of
sebum and sweat.
