This
gap allows for communication between the nasal and oral cavities. In severe cases, the bony gap continues into the
anterior upper jaw where the alveolar processes of the maxilla bones also do not properly join together above the front
teeth. If this occurs, a cleft lip will also be seen. Because of the communication between the oral and nasal cavities, a
cleft palate makes it very difficult for an infant to generate the suckling needed for nursing, thus leaving the infant at
risk for malnutrition. Surgical repair is required to correct cleft palate defects.

 Zygomatic Bone

The zygomatic bone is also known as the cheekbone. Each of the paired zygomatic bones forms much of the lateral wall of
the orbit and the lateral-inferior margins of the anterior orbital opening (see Figure 7.4). The short temporal process of the
zygomatic bone projects posteriorly, where it forms the anterior portion of the zygomatic arch (see Figure 7.5).

Nasal Bone

The nasal bone is one of two small bones that articulate (join) with each other to form the bony base (bridge) of the nose.
