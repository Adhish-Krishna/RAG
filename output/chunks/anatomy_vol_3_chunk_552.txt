Regulation of Osmolarity

Blood pressure and osmolarity are regulated in a similar fashion. Severe hypo-osmolarity can cause problems like lysis
(rupture) of blood cells or widespread edema, which is due to a solute imbalance. Inadequate solute concentration (such as
protein) in the plasma results in water moving toward an area of greater solute concentration, in this case, the interstitial
space and cell cytoplasm.
