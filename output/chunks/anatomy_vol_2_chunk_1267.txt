Many smaller veins of the brain stem and the
superficial veins of the cerebrum lead to larger vessels referred to as intracranial sinuses. These include the superior and
inferior sagittal sinuses, straight sinus, cavernous sinuses, left and right sinuses, the petrosal sinuses, and the occipital
sinuses. Ultimately, sinuses will lead back to either the inferior jugular vein or vertebral vein.

 Most of the veins on the superior surface of the cerebrum flow into the largest of the sinuses, the superior sagittal
sinus. It is located midsagittally between the meningeal and periosteal layers of the dura mater within the falx cerebri and,
at first glance in images or models, can be mistaken for the subarachnoid space. Most reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid
