Autonomic Nervous System

Approximately 33 percent of people experience a mild problem with motion sickness, whereas up to 66 percent
experience motion sickness under extreme conditions, such as being on a tossing boat with no view of the horizon.
 Connections between regions in the brain stem and the autonomic system result in the symptoms of nausea, cold
sweats, and vomiting.

 The part of the brain responsible for vomiting, or emesis, is known as the area postrema. It is located next
to the fourth ventricle and is not restricted by the blood-brain barrier, which allows it to respond to chemicals in
the bloodstream—namely, toxins that will stimulate emesis.
