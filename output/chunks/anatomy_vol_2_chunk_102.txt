However, a slight difference in charge occurs right at the membrane surface, both internally and externally. It is the
difference in this very limited region that has all the power in neurons (and muscle cells) to generate electrical signals,
including action potentials.

 Before these electrical signals can be described, the resting state of the membrane must be explained. When the cell is
at rest, and the ion channels are closed (except for leakage channels which randomly open), ions are distributed across the

membrane in a very predictable way. The concentration of Na” outside the cell is 10 times greater than the concentration

inside. Also, the concentration of K” inside the cell is greater than outside. The cytosol contains a high concentration of
anions, in the form of phosphate ions and negatively charged proteins. Large anions are a component of the inner cell
membrane, including specialized phospholipids and proteins associated with the inner leaflet of the membrane (leaflet is a
term used for one side of the lipid bilayer membrane).
