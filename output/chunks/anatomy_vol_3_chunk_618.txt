Aldosterone
is released if blood levels of potassium increase, if blood levels of sodium severely decrease, or if blood pressure decreases.
 Its net effect is to conserve and increase water levels in the plasma by reducing the excretion of sodium, and thus water, from
the kidneys. In a negative feedback loop, increased osmolality of the ECF (which follows aldosterone-stimulated sodium
absorption) inhibits the release of the hormone (Figure 26.13).

reabsorption of Na* and thus the reabsorption of water.
