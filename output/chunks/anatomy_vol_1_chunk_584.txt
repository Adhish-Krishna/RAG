Figure 6.18 Longitudinal Bone Growth The epiphyseal plate is responsible for longitudinal bone growth.

 The proliferative zone is the next layer toward the diaphysis and contains stacks of slightly larger chondrocytes. It
makes new chondrocytes (via mitosis) to replace those that die at the diaphyseal end of the plate. Chondrocytes in the next
layer, the zone of maturation and hypertrophy, are older and larger than those in the proliferative zone. The more mature
