The sciatic nerve
extends across the hip joint and is most commonly associated with the condition sciatica, which is the result of compression
or irritation of the nerve or any of the spinal nerves giving rise to it.

 These plexuses are described as arising from spinal nerves and giving rise to certain systemic nerves, but they contain
fibers that serve sensory functions or fibers that serve motor functions. This means that some fibers extend from cutaneous
or other peripheral sensory surfaces and send action potentials into the CNS. Those are axons of sensory neurons in the
dorsal root ganglia that enter the spinal cord through the dorsal nerve root. Other fibers are the axons of motor neurons
of the anterior horn of the spinal cord, which emerge in the ventral nerve root and send action potentials to cause skeletal
muscles to contract in their target regions.
