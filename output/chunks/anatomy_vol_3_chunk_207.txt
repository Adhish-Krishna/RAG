The lower esophageal sphincter
relaxes to let food pass into the stomach, and then contracts to prevent stomach acids from backing up into the esophagus.
 Surrounding this sphincter is the muscular diaphragm, which helps close off the sphincter when no food is being swallowed.
 When the lower esophageal sphincter does not completely close, the stomachâ€™s contents can reflux (that is, back up into the
esophagus), causing heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Histology of the Esophagus

The mucosa of the esophagus is made up of an epithelial lining that contains non-keratinized, stratified squamous
epithelium, with a layer of basal and parabasal cells.
