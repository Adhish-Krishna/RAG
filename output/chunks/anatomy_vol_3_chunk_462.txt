Children born lacking this
oblique course of the ureter through the bladder wall are susceptible to “vesicoureteral reflux,” which dramatically increases
their risk of serious UTI. Pregnancy also increases the likelihood of reflux and UTI.

 The ureters are approximately 30 cm long. The inner mucosa is lined with transitional epithelium (Figure 25.6) and
scattered goblet cells that secrete protective mucus. The muscular layer of the ureter consists of longitudinal and circular
smooth muscles that create the peristaltic contractions to move the urine into the bladder without the aid of gravity. Finally,
a loose adventitial layer composed of collagen and fat anchors the ureters between the parietal peritoneum and the posterior
abdominal wall.
