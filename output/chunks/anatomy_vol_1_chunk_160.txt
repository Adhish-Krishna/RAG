In general, kinetic energy is the form of energy powering
any type of matter in motion. Imagine you are building a brick wall. The energy it takes to lift and place one brick atop
another is kinetic energyâ€”the energy matter possesses because of its motion. Once the wall is in place, it stores potential
energy. Potential energy is the energy of position, or the energy matter possesses because of the positioning or structure of
its components. If the brick wall collapses, the stored potential energy is released as kinetic energy as the bricks fall.

 In the human body, potential energy is stored in the bonds between atoms and molecules. Chemical energy is the
form of potential energy in which energy is stored in chemical bonds. When those bonds are formed, chemical energy is
invested, and when they break, chemical energy is released. Notice that chemical energy, like all energy, is neither created
nor destroyed; rather, it is converted from one form to another.
