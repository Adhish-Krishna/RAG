The CD4* T cells will bind to class II MHC and the CD8* cells will bind to class I MHC. The discussion that
follows explains the functions of these molecules and how they can be used to differentiate between the different T cell
functional types.

944 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM

Mechanisms of T Cell-mediated Immune Responses

Mature T cells become activated by recognizing processed foreign antigen in association with a self-MHC molecule and
begin dividing rapidly by mitosis. This proliferation of T cells is called clonal expansion and is necessary to make the
immune response strong enough to effectively control a pathogen. How does the body select only those T cells that are
needed against a specific pathogen? Again, the specificity of a T cell is based on the amino acid sequence and the three-
dimensional shape of the antigen-binding site formed by the variable regions of the two chains of the T cell receptor (Figure
21.19).
