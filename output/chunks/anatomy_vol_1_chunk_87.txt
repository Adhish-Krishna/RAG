 Body Planes

A section is a two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional structure that has been cut. Modern medical imaging
devices enable clinicians to obtain “virtual sections” of living bodies. We call these scans. Body sections and scans can be
correctly interpreted, however, only if the viewer understands the plane along which the section was made. A plane is an
imaginary two-dimensional surface that passes through the body. There are three planes commonly referred to in anatomy
and medicine, as illustrated in Figure 1.14.
 ¢ The sagittal plane is the plane that divides the body or an organ vertically into right and left sides. If this vertical
plane runs directly down the middle of the body, it is called the midsagittal or median plane.
