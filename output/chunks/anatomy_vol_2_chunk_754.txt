These two mechanisms constantly maintain blood calcium
concentration at homeostasis.

 Abnormally high activity of the parathyroid gland can cause hyperparathyroidism, a disorder caused by an
overproduction of PTH that results in excessive calcium reabsorption from bone. Hyperparathyroidism can significantly
decrease bone density, leading to spontaneous fractures or deformities. As blood calcium levels rise, cell membrane
permeability to sodium is decreased, and the responsiveness of the nervous system is reduced. At the same time, calcium
deposits may collect in the bodyâ€™s tissues and organs, impairing their functioning.

 In contrast, abnormally low blood calcium levels may be caused by parathyroid hormone deficiency, called
hypoparathyroidism, which may develop following injury or surgery involving the thyroid gland. Low blood calcium
increases membrane permeability to sodium, resulting in muscle twitching, cramping, spasms, or convulsions. Severe
deficits can paralyze muscles, including those involved in breathing, and can be fatal.

 When blood calcium levels are high, calcitonin is produced and secreted by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland.
