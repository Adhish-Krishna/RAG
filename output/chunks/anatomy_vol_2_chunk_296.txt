CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 561

14 | THE BRAIN AND
CRANIAL NERVES

When high temperature is sensed in the skin, a reflexive withdrawal is initiated by the
muscles of the arm. Sensory neurons are activated by a stimulus, which is sent to the central nervous system, and a
motor response is sent out to the skeletal muscles that control this movement.

 Introduction

Chapter Objectives

After studying this chapter, you will be able to:

* Describe the components of the somatic nervous system

* Name the modalities and submodalities of the sensory systems

 ¢ Distinguish between general and special senses

* Describe regions of the central nervous system that contribute to somatic functions
¢ Explain the stimulus-response motor pathway

The somatic nervous system is traditionally considered a division within the peripheral nervous system. However, this
misses an important point: somatic refers to a functional division, whereas peripheral refers to an anatomic division.
