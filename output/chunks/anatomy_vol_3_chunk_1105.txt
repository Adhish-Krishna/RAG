Micrographs
Micrograph magnifications have been calculated based on the objective provided with the image. If a micrograph was
recorded at 40x, and the image was magnified an additional 2x, we calculated the final magnification of the micrograph to
be 80x.

 Please note that, when viewing the textbook electronically, the micrograph magnification provided in the text does not
take into account the size and magnification of the screen on your electronic device. There may be some variation.
