Therefore the left field of view of each eye is processed on the right side of the
brain, whereas the right field of view of each eye is processed on the left side of the brain (Figure 14.22).

Figure 14.22 Segregation of Visual Field Information at the Optic Chiasm Contralateral visual field information
from the lateral retina projects to the ipsilateral brain, whereas ipsilateral visual field information has to decussate at
the optic chiasm to reach the opposite side of the brain.
