If the nodes were any closer together, the speed of propagation would be slower.

 Propagation along an unmyelinated axon is referred to as continuous conduction; along the length of a myelinated

axon, it is saltatory conduction. Continuous conduction is slow because there are always voltage-gated Na’ channels

opening, and more and more Na’ is rushing into the cell. Saltatory conduction is faster because the action potential basically

jumps from one node to the next (saltare = “to leap”), and the new influx of Na* renews the depolarized membrane. Along
with the myelination of the axon, the diameter of the axon can influence the speed of conduction. Much as water runs faster
in a wide river than in a narrow creek, Na*-based depolarization spreads faster down a wide axon than down a narrow
one. This concept is known as resistance and is generally true for electrical wires or plumbing, just as it is true for axons,
although the specific conditions are different at the scales of electrons or ions versus water in a river.
