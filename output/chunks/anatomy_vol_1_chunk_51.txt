Catabolic reactions
break materials down and release energy. Metabolism includes both anabolic and catabolic reactions.

 Every cell in your body makes use of a chemical compound, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to store and release energy.
 The cell stores energy in the synthesis (anabolism) of ATP, then moves the ATP molecules to the location where energy is
needed to fuel cellular activities. Then the ATP is broken down (catabolism) and a controlled amount of energy is released,
which is used by the cell to perform a particular job.

Responsiveness

Responsiveness is the ability of an organism to adjust to changes in its internal and external environments. An example
of responsiveness to external stimuli could include moving toward sources of food and water and away from perceived
dangers.
