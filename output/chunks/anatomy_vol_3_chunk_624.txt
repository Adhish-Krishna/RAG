groups. The charged regions of these molecules can bind hydrogen and hydroxyl
ions, and thus function as buffers. Buffering by proteins accounts for two-thirds of the buffering power of the blood and
most of the buffering within cells.

 Hemoglobin as a Buffer

Hemoglobin is the principal protein inside of red blood cells and accounts for one-third of the mass of the cell. During the
conversion of CO2 into bicarbonate, hydrogen ions liberated in the reaction are buffered by hemoglobin, which is reduced
by the dissociation of oxygen. This buffering helps maintain normal pH. The process is reversed in the pulmonary capillaries
to re-form CO2, which then can diffuse into the air sacs to be exhaled into the atmosphere. This process is discussed in
detail in the chapter on the respiratory system.

Phosphate Buffer
Phosphates are found in the blood in two forms: sodium dihydrogen phosphate (NaH PO, ), which is a weak acid,

and sodium monohydrogen phosphate ( Nay HPO ), which is a weak base.
