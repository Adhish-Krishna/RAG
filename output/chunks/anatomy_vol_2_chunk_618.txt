Along with
taste, the glossopharyngeal nerve relays general sensations from the pharyngeal walls. These sensations, along with certain
taste stimuli, can stimulate the gag reflex. If the examiner moves the tongue depressor to contact the lateral wall of the
fauces, this should elicit the gag reflex. Stimulation of either side of the fauces should elicit an equivalent response. The
motor response, through contraction of the muscles of the pharynx, is mediated through the vagus nerve. Normally, the
vagus nerve is considered autonomic in nature. The vagus nerve directly stimulates the contraction of skeletal muscles in
the pharynx and larynx to contribute to the swallowing and speech functions. Further testing of vagus motor function has
the patient repeating consonant sounds that require movement of the muscles around the fauces. The patient is asked to
say “lah-kah-pah” or a similar set of alternating sounds while the examiner observes the movements of the soft palate and
arches between the palate and tongue.
