446 CHAPTER 11| THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM

The thenar muscles include the abductor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis, flexor pollicis brevis, and the adductor
pollicis. These muscles form the thenar eminence, the rounded contour of the base of the thumb, and all act on the thumb.
 The movements of the thumb play an integral role in most precise movements of the hand.

 The hypothenar muscles include the abductor digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi brevis, and the opponens digiti
minimi. These muscles form the hypothenar eminence, the rounded contour of the little finger, and as such, they all act on
the little finger. Finally, the intermediate muscles act on all the fingers and include the lumbrical, the palmar interossei,
and the dorsal interossei.
