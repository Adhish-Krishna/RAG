Intuitively, you should realize that minor
changes in osmolarity of the blood or changes in capillary blood pressure result in major changes in the amount of filtrate
formed at any given point in time. The kidney is able to cope with a wide range of blood pressures. In large part, this is due
to the autoregulatory nature of smooth muscle. When you stretch it, it contracts. Thus, when blood pressure goes up, smooth
muscle in the afferent capillaries contracts to limit any increase in blood flow and filtration rate. When blood pressure drops,
the same capillaries relax to maintain blood flow and filtration rate. The net result is a relatively steady flow of blood into
the glomerulus and a relatively steady filtration rate in spite of significant systemic blood pressure changes. Mean arterial
blood pressure is calculated by adding 1/3 of the difference between the systolic and diastolic pressures to the diastolic
pressure. Therefore, if the blood pressure is 110/80, the difference between systolic and diastolic pressure is 30.
