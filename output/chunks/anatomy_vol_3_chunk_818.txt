CHAPTER 28 | DEVELOPMENT AND INHERITANCE 1257

The Fetal Circulatory System

During prenatal development, the fetal circulatory system is integrated with the placenta via the umbilical cord so that the
fetus receives both oxygen and nutrients from the placenta. However, after childbirth, the umbilical cord is severed, and
the newbornâ€™s circulatory system must be reconfigured. When the heart first forms in the embryo, it exists as two parallel
tubes derived from mesoderm and lined with endothelium, which then fuse together. As the embryo develops into a fetus,
the tube-shaped heart folds and further differentiates into the four chambers present in a mature heart. Unlike a mature
cardiovascular system, however, the fetal cardiovascular system also includes circulatory shortcuts, or shunts. A shunt is an
anatomical (or sometimes surgical) diversion that allows blood flow to bypass immature organs such as the lungs and liver
until childbirth.
