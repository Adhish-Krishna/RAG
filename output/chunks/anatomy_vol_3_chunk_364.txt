There are several things that can be done to help prevent general declines in metabolism and to fight back against
the cyclic nature of these declines. These include eating breakfast, eating small meals frequently, consuming plenty
of lean protein, drinking water to remain hydrated, exercising (including strength training), and getting enough sleep.
 These measures can help keep energy levels from dropping and curb the urge for increased calorie consumption from
excessive snacking. While these strategies are not guaranteed to maintain metabolism, they do help prevent muscle loss
and may increase energy levels. Some experts also suggest avoiding sugar, which can lead to excess fat storage. Spicy
foods and green tea might also be beneficial. Because stress activates cortisol release, and cortisol slows metabolism,
avoiding stress, or at least practicing relaxation techniques, can also help.
