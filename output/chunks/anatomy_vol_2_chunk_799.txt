The lower metabolic rate reduces the production of body heat and increases levels of body fat. Parathyroid
hormones, on the other hand, increase with age. This may be because of reduced dietary calcium levels, causing a
compensatory increase in parathyroid hormone. However, increased parathyroid hormone levels combined with decreased

levels of calcitonin (and estrogens in women) can lead to osteoporosis as PTH stimulates demineralization of bones to
increase blood calcium levels. Notice that osteoporosis is common in both elderly males and females.

 Increasing age also affects glucose metabolism, as blood glucose levels spike more rapidly and take longer to return to
normal in the elderly. In addition, increasing glucose intolerance may occur because of a gradual decline in cellular insulin
sensitivity. Almost 27 percent of Americans aged 65 and older have diabetes.

CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 727

KEY TERMS

acromegaly disorder in adults caused when abnormally high levels of GH trigger growth of bones in the face, hands,
and feet

adenylyl cyclase membrane-bound enzyme that converts ATP to cyclic AMP, creating cAMP, as a result of G-protein
activation

adrenal cortex outer region of the adrenal glands consisting of multiple layers of epithelial cells and capillary
networks that produces mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids

adrenal glands endocrine glands located at the top of each kidney that are important for the regulation of the stress
response, blood pressure and blood volume, water homeostasis, and electrolyte levels

adrenal medulla inner layer of the adrenal glands that plays an important role in the stress response by producing
epinephrine and norepinephrine

adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) anterior pituitary hormone that stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete
corticosteroid hormones (also called corticotropin)

alarm reaction the short-term stress, or the fight-or-flight response, of stage one of the general adaptation syndrome
mediated by the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine

aldosterone hormone produced and secreted by the adrenal cortex that stimulates sodium and fluid retention and
increases blood volume and blood pressure

alpha cell pancreatic islet cell type that produces the hormone glucagon
angiotensin-converting enzyme the enzyme that converts angiotensin | to angiotensin II

antidiuretic hormone (ADH) hypothalamic hormone that is stored by the posterior pituitary and that signals the
kidneys to reabsorb water

atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) peptide hormone produced by the walls of the atria in response to high blood
pressure, blood volume, or blood sodium that reduces the reabsorption of sodium and water in the kidneys and
promotes vasodilation

autocrine chemical signal that elicits a response in the same cell that secreted it
beta cell pancreatic islet cell type that produces the hormone insulin

calcitonin peptide hormone produced and secreted by the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid gland that
functions to decrease blood calcium levels

chromaffin neuroendocrine cells of the adrenal medulla
colloid viscous fluid in the central cavity of thyroid follicles, containing the glycoprotein thyroglobulin

cortisol glucocorticoid important in gluconeogenesis, the catabolism of glycogen, and downregulation of the immune
system

cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) second messenger that, in response to adenylyl cyclase activation,
triggers a phosphorylation cascade

delta cell minor cell type in the pancreas that secretes the hormone somatostatin

diabetes mellitus condition caused by destruction or dysfunction of the beta cells of the pancreas or cellular resistance
to insulin that results in abnormally high blood glucose levels

diacylglycerol (DAG) molecule that, like cAMP, activates protein kinases, thereby initiating a phosphorylation
cascade

downregulation decrease in the number of hormone receptors, typically in response to chronically excessive levels of
a hormone

728 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

endocrine gland tissue or organ that secretes hormones into the blood and lymph without ducts such that they may be
transported to organs distant from the site of secretion

endocrine system cells, tissues, and organs that secrete hormones as a primary or secondary function and play an
integral role in normal bodily processes

epinephrine primary and most potent catecholamine hormone secreted by the adrenal medulla in response to short-
term stress; also called adrenaline

erythropoietin (EPO) protein hormone secreted in response to low oxygen levels that triggers the bone marrow to
produce red blood cells

estrogens class of predominantly female sex hormones important for the development and growth of the female
reproductive tract, secondary sex characteristics, the female reproductive cycle, and the maintenance of pregnancy

exocrine system cells, tissues, and organs that secrete substances directly to target tissues via glandular ducts

first messenger hormone that binds to a cell membrane hormone receptor and triggers activation of a second
messenger system

follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) anterior pituitary hormone that stimulates the production and maturation of sex
cells

G protein protein associated with a cell membrane hormone receptor that initiates the next step in a second messenger
system upon activation by hormone-receptor binding

general adaptation syndrome (GAS) the human body’s three-stage response pattern to short- and long-term stress
gigantism disorder in children caused when abnormally high levels of GH prompt excessive growth

glucagon pancreatic hormone that stimulates the catabolism of glycogen to glucose, thereby increasing blood glucose
levels

glucocorticoids hormones produced by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex that influence glucose metabolism
goiter enlargement of the thyroid gland either as a result of iodine deficiency or hyperthyroidism
gonadotropins hormones that regulate the function of the gonads

growth hormone (GH) anterior pituitary hormone that promotes tissue building and influences nutrient metabolism
(also called somatotropin)

hormone receptor protein within a cell or on the cell membrane that binds a hormone, initiating the target cell
response

hormone secretion of an endocrine organ that travels via the bloodstream or lymphatics to induce a response in target
cells or tissues in another part of the body

hyperglycemia abnormally high blood glucose levels
hyperparathyroidism disorder caused by overproduction of PTH that results in abnormally elevated blood calcium

hyperthyroidism clinically abnormal, elevated level of thyroid hormone in the blood; characterized by an increased
metabolic rate, excess body heat, sweating, diarrhea, weight loss, and increased heart rate

hypoparathyroidism disorder caused by underproduction of PTH that results in abnormally low blood calcium

hypophyseal portal system network of blood vessels that enables hypothalamic hormones to travel into the anterior
lobe of the pituitary without entering the systemic circulation

hypothalamus region of the diencephalon inferior to the thalamus that functions in neural and endocrine signaling

hypothyroidism clinically abnormal, low level of thyroid hormone in the blood; characterized by low metabolic rate,
weight gain, cold extremities, constipation, and reduced mental activity

infundibulum stalk containing vasculature and neural tissue that connects the pituitary gland to the hypothalamus (also
called the pituitary stalk)
