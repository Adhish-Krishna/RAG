Many combinations are possible to fill carbon’s four “vacancies.” Carbon may share electrons with oxygen or nitrogen
or other atoms in a particular region of an organic compound. Moreover, the atoms to which carbon atoms bond may also be
part of a functional group. A functional group is a group of atoms linked by strong covalent bonds and tending to function
in chemical reactions as a single unit. You can think of functional groups as tightly knit “cliques” whose members are
unlikely to be parted. Five functional groups are important in human physiology; these are the hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino,
methyl and phosphate groups (Table 2.1).
