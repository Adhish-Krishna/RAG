* Mandibular foramen—This opening is located on the medial side of the ramus of the mandible. The opening leads
into a tunnel that runs down the length of the mandibular body. The sensory nerve and blood vessels that supply the
lower teeth enter the mandibular foramen and then follow this tunnel. Thus, to numb the lower teeth prior to dental
work, the dentist must inject anesthesia into the lateral wall of the oral cavity at a point prior to where this sensory
nerve enters the mandibular foramen.

 ¢ Lingula—This small flap of bone is named for its shape (lingula = “little tongue”). It is located immediately next to
the mandibular foramen, on the medial side of the ramus. A ligament that anchors the mandible during opening and
closing of the mouth extends down from the base of the skull and attaches to the lingula.
