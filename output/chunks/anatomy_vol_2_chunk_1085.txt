Therefore, by increasing
preload, you increase the second variable, contractility.

 Otto Frank (1865-1944) was a German physiologist; among his many published works are detailed studies of this
important heart relationship. Ernest Starling (1866-1927) was an important English physiologist who also studied the heart.

 Although they worked largely independently, their combined efforts and similar conclusions have been recognized in the
name “Frank-Starling mechanism.”
 Any sympathetic stimulation to the venous system will increase venous return to the heart, which contributes to
ventricular filling, and EDV and preload. While much of the ventricular filling occurs while both atria and ventricles are in
diastole, the contraction of the atria, the atrial kick, plays a crucial role by providing the last 20-30 percent of ventricular
filling.
