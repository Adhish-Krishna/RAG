One third of
this is 10, and when you add this to the diastolic pressure of 80, you arrive at a calculated mean arterial pressure of 90 mm
Hg. Therefore, if you use mean arterial pressure for the GBHP in the formula for calculating NFP, you can determine that
as long as mean arterial pressure is above approximately 60 mm Hg, the pressure will be adequate to maintain glomerular

filtration. Blood pressures below this level will impair renal function and cause systemic disorders that are severe enough
to threaten survival. This condition is called shock.

 Determination of the GFR is one of the tools used to assess the kidneyâ€™s excretory function. This is more than just an
academic exercise. Since many drugs are excreted in the urine, a decline in renal function can lead to toxic accumulations.
 Additionally, administration of appropriate drug dosages for those drugs primarily excreted by the kidney requires an
accurate assessment of GFR.
