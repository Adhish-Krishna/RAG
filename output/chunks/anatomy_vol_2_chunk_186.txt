No functional differences may be noticed, which is what the word occulta means; it
is hidden spina bifida. The other two types both involve the formation of a cyst—a fluid-filled sac of the connective
tissues that cover the spinal cord called the meninges. “Meningocele” means that the meninges protrude through the
spinal column but nerves may not be involved and few symptoms are present, though complications may arise later
in life. “Myelomeningocele” means that the meninges protrude and spinal nerves are involved, and therefore severe
neurological symptoms can be present.

 Often surgery to close the opening or to remove the cyst is necessary. The earlier that surgery can be performed,
the better the chances of controlling or limiting further damage or infection at the opening. For many children
with meningocele, surgery will alleviate the pain, although they may experience some functional loss. Because the
myelomeningocele form of spina bifida involves more extensive damage to the nervous tissue, neurological damage
may persist, but symptoms can often be handled.
