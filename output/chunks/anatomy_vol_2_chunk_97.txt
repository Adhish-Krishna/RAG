A neurotransmitter, Neurotransmitter Neurotransmitter
the ligand, is required receptor site attaches to receptor

Cytosol Chemical stimulus lons move in response
opens the channel to gradient

Figure 12.18 Ligand-Gated Channels When the ligand, in this case the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, binds to a
specific location on the extracellular surface of the channel protein, the pore opens to allow select ions through.
