A reduced sweating ability can cause some elderly to be intolerant to extreme heat. Other cells in
the skin, such as melanocytes and dendritic cells, also become less active, leading to a paler skin tone and lowered
immunity. Wrinkling of the skin occurs due to breakdown of its structure, which results from decreased collagen and
elastin production in the dermis, weakening of muscles lying under the skin, and the inability of the skin to retain
adequate moisture.

 Many anti-aging products can be found in stores today. In general, these products try to rehydrate the skin
and thereby fill out the wrinkles, and some stimulate skin growth using hormones and growth factors. Additionally,

invasive techniques include collagen injections to plump the tissue and injections of BOTOXÂ® (the name brand of the
botulinum neurotoxin) that paralyze the muscles that crease the skin and cause wrinkling.
