First, the neural tube establishes the anterior—posterior dimension of the
nervous system, which is called the neuraxis. The embryonic nervous system in mammals can be said to have a standard
arrangement. Humans (and other primates, to some degree) make this complicated by standing up and walking on two legs.
 The anterior—posterior dimension of the neuraxis overlays the superior—inferior dimension of the body. However, there is a
major curve between the brain stem and forebrain, which is called the cephalic flexure. Because of this, the neuraxis starts
in an inferior position—the end of the spinal cord—and ends in an anterior position, the front of the cerebrum. If this is
confusing, just imagine a four-legged animal standing up on two legs. Without the flexure in the brain stem, and at the top
of the neck, that animal would be looking straight up instead of straight in front (Figure 13.4).
