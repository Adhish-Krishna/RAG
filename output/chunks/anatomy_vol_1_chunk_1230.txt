The transversospinales include the
semispinalis capitis, semispinalis cervicis, semispinalis thoracis, multifidus, and rotatores. The segmental muscles include
the interspinales and intertransversarii. Finally, the scalenes include the anterior scalene, middle scalene, and posterior
scalene.

 11.4 Axial Muscles of the Abdominal Wall and Thorax

Made of skin, fascia, and four pairs of muscle, the anterior abdominal wall protects the organs located in the abdomen
and moves the vertebral column. These muscles include the rectus abdominis, which extends through the entire length of
the trunk, the external oblique, the internal oblique, and the transversus abdominus. The quadratus lumborum forms the
posterior abdominal wall.

 The muscles of the thorax play a large role in breathing, especially the dome-shaped diaphragm. When it contracts and
â€˜lattens, the volume inside the pleural cavities increases, which decreases the pressure within them. As a result, air will flow
into the lungs. The external and internal intercostal muscles span the space between the ribs and help change the shape of
the rib cage and the volume-pressure ratio inside the pleural cavities during inspiration and expiration.
