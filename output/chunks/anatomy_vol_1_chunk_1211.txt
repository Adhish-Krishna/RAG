Thigh Muscles That Move the Femur, Tibia, and Fibula

Deep fascia in the thigh separates it into medial, anterior, and posterior compartments (see Figure 11.29 and Figure 11.31).
 The muscles in the medial compartment of the thigh are responsible for adducting the femur at the hip. Along with the
adductor longus, adductor brevis, adductor magnus, and pectineus, the strap-like gracilis adducts the thigh in addition to
flexing the leg at the knee.
