It consists of a sequence of vertebrae
(singular = vertebra), each of which is separated and united by an intervertebral disc. Together, the vertebrae and
intervertebral discs form the vertebral column. It is a flexible column that supports the head, neck, and body and allows for
their movements. It also protects the spinal cord, which passes down the back through openings in the vertebrae.
