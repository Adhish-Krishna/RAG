For example, prenatal exposure to BPA during the
first trimester of human pregnancy may be associated with wheezing and aggressive behavior during childhood. Adults
exposed to high levels of BPA may experience altered thyroid signaling and male sexual dysfunction. BPA exposure
during the prenatal or postnatal period of development in animal models has been observed to cause neurological
delays, changes in brain structure and function, sexual dysfunction, asthma, and increased risk for multiple cancers.
 In vitro studies have also shown that BPA exposure causes molecular changes that initiate the development of cancers
of the breast, prostate, and brain. Although these studies have implicated BPA in numerous ill health effects, some
experts caution that some of these studies may be flawed and that more research needs to be done. In the meantime, the
FDA recommends that consumers take precautions to limit their exposure to BPA. In addition to purchasing foods in
packaging free of BPA, consumers should avoid carrying or storing foods or liquids in bottles with the recycling code
3 or 7.
