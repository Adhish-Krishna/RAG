There
are multiple factors involved in how readily heme binds to and dissociates from oxygen, which will be discussed in the
subsequent sections.

 Figure 22.25 Erythrocyte and Hemoglobin Hemoglobin consists of four subunits, each of which contains one
molecule of iron.

 Function of Hemoglobin

Hemoglobin is composed of subunits, a protein structure that is referred to as a quaternary structure. Each of the four
subunits that make up hemoglobin is arranged in a ring-like fashion, with an iron atom covalently bound to the heme in
the center of each subunit. Binding of the first oxygen molecule causes a conformational change in hemoglobin that allows
the second molecule of oxygen to bind more readily. As each molecule of oxygen is bound, it further facilitates the binding
of the next molecule, until all four heme sites are occupied by oxygen. The opposite occurs as well: After the first oxygen
molecule dissociates and is “dropped off” at the tissues, the next oxygen molecule dissociates more readily.
