Air flows into the lungs largely due to a difference in pressure;
atmospheric pressure is greater than intra-alveolar pressure, and intra-alveolar pressure is greater than intrapleural pressure.
 Air flows out of the lungs during expiration based on the same principle; pressure within the lungs becomes greater than the
atmospheric pressure.

 Pulmonary ventilation comprises two major steps: inspiration and expiration. Inspiration is the process that causes air
to enter the lungs, and expiration is the process that causes air to leave the lungs (Figure 22.17). A respiratory cycle is one
sequence of inspiration and expiration. In general, two muscle groups are used during normal inspiration: the diaphragm
and the external intercostal muscles. Additional muscles can be used if a bigger breath is required. When the diaphragm
contracts, it moves inferiorly toward the abdominal cavity, creating a larger thoracic cavity and more space for the lungs.
