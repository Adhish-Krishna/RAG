There are several functional types of T
lymphocytes, the major ones being helper, regulatory, and cytotoxic T cells.

 21.4 The Adaptive Immune Response: B-lymphocytes and Antibodies

B cells, which develop within the bone marrow, are responsible for making five different classes of antibodies, each with
its own functions. B cells have their own mechanisms for tolerance, but in peripheral tolerance, the B cells that leave the
bone marrow remain inactive due to T cell tolerance. Some B cells do not need T cell cytokines to make antibody, and they
bypass this need by the crosslinking of their surface immunoglobulin by repeated carbohydrate residues found in the cell
walls of many bacterial species. Others require T cells to become activated.

21.5 The Immune Response against Pathogens

Early childhood is a time when the body develops much of its immunological memory that protects it from diseases in
adulthood.
