Recent evidence indicates that at least some stem cells remain within the heart that continue to divide and
at least potentially replace these dead cells. However, newly formed or repaired cells are rarely as functional as the
original cells, and cardiac function is reduced. In the event of a heart attack or MI, dead cells are often replaced
by patches of scar tissue. Autopsies performed on individuals who had successfully received heart transplants show
some proliferation of original cells. If researchers can unlock the mechanism that generates new cells and restore
full mitotic capabilities to heart muscle, the prognosis for heart attack survivors will be greatly enhanced. To date,
myocardial cells produced within the patient (in situ) by cardiac stem cells seem to be nonfunctional, although those
grown in Petri dishes (in vitro) do beat. Perhaps soon this mystery will be solved, and new advances in treatment will
be commonplace.

 Conduction System of the Heart

If embryonic heart cells are separated into a Petri dish and kept alive, each is capable of generating its own electrical
impulse followed by contraction.
