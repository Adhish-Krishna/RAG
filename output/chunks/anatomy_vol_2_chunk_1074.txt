While
many patients survive the initial acute event with treatment to restore normal function, there is a strong correlation with
death. Careful statistical analysis by the Cass Business School, a prestigious institution located in London, published
in 2008, revealed that within one year of the death of a loved one, women are more than twice as likely to die and
males are six times as likely to die as would otherwise be expected.

 Other Factors Influencing Heart Rate

Using a combination of autorhythmicity and innervation, the cardiovascular center is able to provide relatively precise
control over HR. However, there are a number of other factors that have an impact on HR as well, including epinephrine,
NE, and thyroid hormones; levels of various ions including calcium, potassium, and sodium; body temperature; hypoxia;
and pH balance (Table 19.1 and Table 19.2).
