The more medial of these areas is the trochlea, a spindle- or pulley-shaped region (trochlea = “pulley”),
which articulates with the ulna bone. Immediately lateral to the trochlea is the capitulum (“small head”), a knob-like
structure located on the anterior surface of the distal humerus. The capitulum articulates with the radius bone of the forearm.
 Just above these bony areas are two small depressions. These spaces accommodate the forearm bones when the elbow is
fully bent (flexed). Superior to the trochlea is the coronoid fossa, which receives the coronoid process of the ulna, and above
the capitulum is the radial fossa, which receives the head of the radius when the elbow is flexed. Similarly, the posterior
humerus has the olecranon fossa, a larger depression that receives the olecranon process of the ulna when the forearm is
fully extended.
