The afferent branch responds to light hitting the
retina. Photoreceptors are activated, and the signal is transferred to the retinal ganglion cells that send an action potential
along the optic nerve into the diencephalon. If light levels are low, the sympathetic system sends a signal out through the
upper thoracic spinal cord to the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic chain. The postganglionic fiber then projects
to the iris, where it releases norepinephrine onto the radial fibers of the iris (a smooth muscle). When those fibers contract,
the pupil dilates—increasing the amount of light hitting the retina. If light levels are too high, the parasympathetic system
sends a signal out from the Eddinger—Westphal nucleus through the oculomotor nerve. This fiber synapses in the ciliary
ganglion in the posterior orbit. The postganglionic fiber then projects to the iris, where it releases ACh onto the circular
fibers of the iris—another smooth muscle.
