The digestive enzymes released by this reaction digest
the extracellular matrix of the corona radiata. As you can see, the first sperm to reach the oocyte is never the one to fertilize
it. Rather, hundreds of sperm cells must undergo the acrosomal reaction, each helping to degrade the corona radiata and
zona pellucida until a path is created to allow one sperm to contact and fuse with the plasma membrane of the oocyte. If
you consider the loss of millions of sperm between entry into the vagina and degradation of the zona pellucida, you can
understand why a low sperm count can cause male infertility.
