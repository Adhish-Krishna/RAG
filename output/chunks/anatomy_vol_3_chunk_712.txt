As in men, the hypothalamus produces GnRH, a hormone that signals the anterior pituitary gland to produce the
gonadotropins FSH and LH (Figure 27.13). These gonadotropins leave the pituitary and travel through the bloodstream to
the ovaries, where they bind to receptors on the granulosa and theca cells of the follicles. FSH stimulates the follicles to
grow (hence its name of follicle-stimulating hormone), and the five or six tertiary follicles expand in diameter. The release
of LH also stimulates the granulosa and theca cells of the follicles to produce the sex steroid hormone estradiol, a type of
estrogen. This phase of the ovarian cycle, when the tertiary follicles are growing and secreting estrogen, is known as the
ollicular phase.
 The more granulosa and theca cells a follicle has (that is, the larger and more developed it is), the more estrogen it will
produce in response to LH stimulation.
