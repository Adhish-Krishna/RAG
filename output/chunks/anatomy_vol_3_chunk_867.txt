Colostrum is rich with immunoglobulins, which confer gastrointestinal, and also likely systemic, immunity as the newborn
adjusts to a nonsterile environment.

 After about the third postpartum day, the mother secretes transitional milk that represents an intermediate between
mature milk and colostrum. This is followed by mature milk from approximately postpartum day 10 (see Table 28.3). As
you can see in the accompanying table, cow’s milk is not a substitute for breast milk. It contains less lactose, less fat, and
more protein and minerals. Moreover, the proteins in cow’s milk are difficult for an infant’s immature digestive system to
metabolize and absorb.

 The first few weeks of breastfeeding may involve leakage, soreness, and periods of milk engorgement as the
relationship between milk supply and infant demand becomes established. Once this period is complete, the mother will
produce approximately 1.5 liters of milk per day for a single infant, and more if she has twins or triplets.
