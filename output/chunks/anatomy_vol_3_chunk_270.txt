A hepatic sinusoid is an open, porous blood space formed by fenestrated capillaries from nutrient-rich hepatic portal
veins and oxygen-rich hepatic arteries. Hepatocytes are tightly packed around the fenestrated endothelium of these spaces,
giving them easy access to the blood. From their central position, hepatocytes process the nutrients, toxins, and waste
materials carried by the blood. Materials such as bilirubin are processed and excreted into the bile canaliculi. Other materials

including proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates are processed and secreted into the sinusoids or just stored in the cells until
called upon. The hepatic sinusoids combine and send blood to a central vein. Blood then flows through a hepatic vein
into the inferior vena cava. This means that blood and bile flow in opposite directions. The hepatic sinusoids also contain
star-shaped reticuloendothelial cells (Kupffer cells), phagocytes that remove dead red and white blood cells, bacteria, and
other foreign material that enter the sinusoids.
