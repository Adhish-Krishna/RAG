Specifically, males have about 5.4 million
erythrocytes per microliter (uL) of blood, and females have approximately 4.8 million per pL. In fact, erythrocytes are
estimated to make up about 25 percent of the total cells in the body. As you can imagine, they are quite small cells, with
a mean diameter of only about 7-8 micrometers (um) (Figure 18.5). The primary functions of erythrocytes are to pick up
inhaled oxygen from the lungs and transport it to the bodyâ€™s tissues, and to pick up some (about 24 percent) carbon dioxide
waste at the tissues and transport it to the lungs for exhalation. Erythrocytes remain within the vascular network. Although
leukocytes typically leave the blood vessels to perform their defensive functions, movement of erythrocytes from the blood
vessels is abnormal.
