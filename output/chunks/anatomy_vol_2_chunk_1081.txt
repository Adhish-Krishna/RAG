Recall that enzymes are the regulators or catalysts of virtually all biochemical reactions; they are sensitive to
PH and will change shape slightly with values outside their normal range. These variations in pH and accompanying
slight physical changes to the active site on the enzyme decrease the rate of formation of the enzyme-substrate complex,
subsequently decreasing the rate of many enzymatic reactions, which can have complex effects on HR. Severe changes in
pH will lead to denaturation of the enzyme.

 The last variable is body temperature. Elevated body temperature is called hyperthermia, and suppressed body
temperature is called hypothermia. Slight hyperthermia results in increasing HR and strength of contraction. Hypothermia
slows the rate and strength of heart contractions. This distinct slowing of the heart is one component of the larger diving
reflex that diverts blood to essential organs while submerged. If sufficiently chilled, the heart will stop beating, a technique
that may be employed during open heart surgery.
