If one assumes an average rate of contraction of 75 contractions per minute, a
human heart would contract approximately 108,000 times in one day, more than 39 million times in one year, and nearly 3
billion times during a 75-year lifespan. Each of the major pumping chambers of the heart ejects approximately 70 mL blood
per contraction in a resting adult. This would be equal to 5.25 liters of fluid per minute and approximately 14,000 liters per
day. Over one year, that would equal 10,000,000 liters or 2.6 million gallons of blood sent through roughly 60,000 miles of
vessels. In order to understand how that happens, it is necessary to understand the anatomy and physiology of the heart.

 Location of the Heart

The human heart is located within the thoracic cavity, medially between the lungs in the space known as the mediastinum.
 Figure 19.2 shows the position of the heart within the thoracic cavity. Within the mediastinum, the heart is separated from
the other mediastinal structures by a tough membrane known as the pericardium, or pericardial sac, and sits in its own space
called the pericardial cavity.
