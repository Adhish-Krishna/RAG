Bronchial veins carry
approximately 13 percent of the blood that flows into the bronchial arteries; the remainder intermingles with the pulmonary
circulation and returns to the heart via the pulmonary veins. These veins flow into the azygos vein, and with the smaller
hemiazygos vein (hemi- = “half”) on the left of the vertebral column, drain blood from the thoracic region. The hemiazygos
vein does not drain directly into the superior vena cava but enters the brachiocephalic vein via the superior intercostal vein.

 The azygos vein passes through the diaphragm from the thoracic cavity on the right side of the vertebral column and
begins in the lumbar region of the thoracic cavity. It flows into the superior vena cava at approximately the level of T2,
making a significant contribution to the flow of blood. It combines with the two large left and right brachiocephalic veins
to form the superior vena cava.

 Table 20.11 summarizes the veins of the thoracic region that flow into the superior vena cava.
