A fold of mucous membrane on the underside of the tongue,
the lingual frenulum, tethers the tongue to the floor of the mouth. People with the congenital anomaly ankyloglossia, also
known by the non-medical term “tongue tie,” have a lingual frenulum that is too short or otherwise malformed. Severe
ankyloglossia can impair speech and must be corrected with surgery.

 The Salivary Glands

Many small salivary glands are housed within the mucous membranes of the mouth and tongue. These minor exocrine
glands are constantly secreting saliva, either directly into the oral cavity or indirectly through ducts, even while you sleep.
