Remember that gases travel from an area of higher partial pressure
to an area of lower partial pressure. In addition, the affinity of an oxygen molecule for heme increases as more oxygen
molecules are bound. Therefore, in the oxygen—hemoglobin saturation curve, as the partial pressure of oxygen increases,
a proportionately greater number of oxygen molecules are bound by heme. Not surprisingly, the oxygen—hemoglobin
saturation/dissociation curve also shows that the lower the partial pressure of oxygen, the fewer oxygen molecules are bound
to heme. As a result, the partial pressure of oxygen plays a major role in determining the degree of binding of oxygen to
heme at the site of the respiratory membrane, as well as the degree of dissociation of oxygen from heme at the site of body
tissues.
