Some of these molecules enter and leave cells using facilitated transport, whereby the molecules move
down a concentration gradient through specific protein channels in the membrane. This process does not require energy. For
example, glucose is transferred into cells by glucose transporters that use facilitated transport (Figure 26.8).
