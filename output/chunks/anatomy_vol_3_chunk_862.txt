Milk drains from lactiferous
ducts into lactiferous sinuses that meet at 4 to 18 perforations in the nipple, called nipple pores. The small bumps of the
areola (the darkened skin around the nipple) are called Montgomery glands. They secrete oil to cleanse the nipple opening
and prevent chapping and cracking of the nipple during breastfeeding.

 The Process of Lactation

The pituitary hormone prolactin is instrumental in the establishment and maintenance of breast milk supply. It also is
important for the mobilization of maternal micronutrients for breast milk.
 Near the fifth week of pregnancy, the level of circulating prolactin begins to increase, eventually rising to
approximately 10-20 times the pre-pregnancy concentration. We noted earlier that, during pregnancy, prolactin and other
hormones prepare the breasts anatomically for the secretion of milk. The level of prolactin plateaus in late pregnancy, at
a level high enough to initiate milk production. However, estrogen, progesterone, and other placental hormones inhibit
prolactin-mediated milk synthesis during pregnancy.
