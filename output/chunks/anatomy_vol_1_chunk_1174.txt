The range of motion of a particular joint refers to the normal
movements the joint performs. The PT will ask you to abduct and adduct, circumduct, and flex and extend the arm. The
PT will note the shoulderâ€™s degree of function, and based on the assessment of the injury, will create an appropriate
physical therapy plan.

 The first step in physical therapy will probably be applying a heat pack to the injured site, which acts much like
a warm-up to draw blood to the area, to enhance healing. You will be instructed to do a series of exercises to continue
the therapy at home, followed by icing, to decrease inflammation and swelling, which will continue for several weeks.
 When physical therapy is complete, the PT will do an exit exam and send a detailed report on the improved range of
motion and return of normal limb function to your doctor.
