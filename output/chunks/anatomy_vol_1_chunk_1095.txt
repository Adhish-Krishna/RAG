In general, visceral smooth
muscle produces slow, steady contractions that allow substances, such as food in the digestive tract, to move through the
body.

 Multiunit smooth muscle cells rarely possess gap junctions, and thus are not electrically coupled. As a result,
contraction does not spread from one cell to the next, but is instead confined to the cell that was originally stimulated.
 Stimuli for multiunit smooth muscles come from autonomic nerves or hormones but not from stretching. This type of tissue
is found around large blood vessels, in the respiratory airways, and in the eyes.

 Hyperplasia in Smooth Muscle

Similar to skeletal and cardiac muscle cells, smooth muscle can undergo hypertrophy to increase in size. Unlike other
muscle, smooth muscle can also divide to produce more cells, a process called hyperplasia. This can most evidently be
observed in the uterus at puberty, which responds to increased estrogen levels by producing more uterine smooth muscle
fibers, and greatly increases the size of the myometrium.
