This
is because class switching occurs during primary responses. IgG is a monomeric antibody that clears pathogens from the
blood and can activate complement proteins (although not as well as IgM), taking advantage of its antibacterial activities.
 Furthermore, this class of antibody is the one that crosses the placenta to protect the developing fetus from disease exits the
blood to the interstitial fluid to fight extracellular pathogens.

 IgA exists in two forms, a four-chain monomer in the blood and an eight-chain structure, or dimer, in exocrine gland
secretions of the mucous membranes, including mucus, saliva, and tears. Thus, dimeric IgA is the only antibody to leave
the interior of the body to protect body surfaces. IgA is also of importance to newborns, because this antibody is present in
motherâ€™s breast milk (colostrum), which serves to protect the infant from disease.
