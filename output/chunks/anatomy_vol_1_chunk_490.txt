Although neither is fatal, it would be hard to claim that they are benign, at least to the individuals so afflicted.

 Albinism is a genetic disorder that affects (completely or partially) the coloring of skin, hair, and eyes. The defect
is primarily due to the inability of melanocytes to produce melanin. Individuals with albinism tend to appear white
or very pale due to the lack of melanin in their skin and hair. Recall that melanin helps protect the skin from the
harmful effects of UV radiation. Individuals with albinism tend to need more protection from UV radiation, as they
are more prone to sunburns and skin cancer. They also tend to be more sensitive to light and have vision problems due
to the lack of pigmentation on the retinal wall. Treatment of this disorder usually involves addressing the symptoms,
such as limiting UV light exposure to the skin and eyes. In vitiligo, the melanocytes in certain areas lose their ability
to produce melanin, possibly due to an autoimmune reaction.
