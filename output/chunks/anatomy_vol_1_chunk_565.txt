The hydroxyapatite crystals give bones their hardness and strength, while the collagen
fibers give them flexibility so that they are not brittle.

 Although bone cells compose a smal! amount of the bone volume, they are crucial to the function of bones. Four types
of cells are found within bone tissue: osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteogenic cells, and osteoclasts (Figure 6.11).

 Figure 6.11 Bone Cells Four types of cells are found within bone tissue. Osteogenic cells are undifferentiated
and develop into osteoblasts. When osteoblasts get trapped within the calcified matrix, their structure and function
changes, and they become osteocytes. Osteoclasts develop from monocytes and macrophages and differ in
appearance from other bone cells.

 The osteoblast is the bone cell responsible for forming new bone and is found in the growing portions of bone,
including the periosteum and endosteum.
