Secretin also stimulates the
pancreas to release sodium bicarbonate. The pancreas releases most of the digestive enzymes, including the proteases
trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase, which aid protein digestion. Together, all of these enzymes break complex proteins into
smaller individual amino acids (Figure 24.17), which are then transported across the intestinal mucosa to be used to create
new proteins, or to be converted into fats or acetyl CoA and used in the Krebs cycle.
