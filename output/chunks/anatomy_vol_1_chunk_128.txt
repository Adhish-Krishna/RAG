One proton is the same as another, whether it is found
in an atom of carbon, sodium (Na), or iron (Fe). The same is true for neutrons and electrons. So, what gives an element its
distinctive propertiesâ€”what makes carbon so different from sodium or iron? The answer is the unique quantity of protons
each contains. Carbon by definition is an element whose atoms contain six protons. No other element has exactly six protons
in its atoms. Moreover, all atoms of carbon, whether found in your liver or in a lump of coal, contain six protons. Thus, the
atomic number, which is the number of protons in the nucleus of the atom, identifies the element. Because an atom usually
has the same number of electrons as protons, the atomic number identifies the usual number of electrons as well.

 In their most common form, many elements also contain the same number of neutrons as protons.
