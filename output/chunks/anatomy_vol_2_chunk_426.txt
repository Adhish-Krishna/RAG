Spinal nerves have mixed populations of fibers; some are motor fibers
and some are sensory. The sensory fibers connect to the spinal cord through the dorsal root, which is attached to the dorsal
root ganglion. Sensory information from the body that is conveyed through spinal nerves will project to the opposite side of
the brain to be processed by the cerebral cortex. The cranial nerves can be strictly sensory fibers, such as the olfactory, optic,
and vestibulocochlear nerves, or mixed sensory and motor nerves, such as the trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal, and
vagus nerves. The cranial nerves are connected to the same side of the brain from which the sensory information originates.

 14.2 Central Processing

Sensory input to the brain enters through pathways that travel through either the spinal cord (for somatosensory input from
the body) or the brain stem (for everything else, except the visual and olfactory systems) to reach the diencephalon.
