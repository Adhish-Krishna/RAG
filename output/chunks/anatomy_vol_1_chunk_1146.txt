The orbicularis oris is a circular muscle that moves the lips, and the orbicularis oculi is a circular muscle that closes
the eye. The occipitofrontalis muscle moves up the scalp and eyebrows. The muscle has a frontal belly and an occipital
(near the occipital bone on the posterior part of the skull) belly. In other words, there is a muscle on the forehead ( frontalis)
and one on the back of the head ( occipitalis), but there is no muscle across the top of the head. Instead, the two bellies
are connected by a broad tendon called the epicranial aponeurosis, or galea aponeurosis (galea = “apple”). The physicians
originally studying human anatomy thought the skull looked like an apple.

 The majority of the face is composed of the buccinator muscle, which compresses the cheek. This muscle allows you
to whistle, blow, and suck; and it contributes to the action of chewing.
