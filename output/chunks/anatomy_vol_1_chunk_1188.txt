The two axial muscles are the pectoralis
major and the latissimus dorsi. The pectoralis major is thick and fan-shaped, covering much of the superior portion of the
anterior thorax. The broad, triangular latissimus dorsi is located on the inferior part of the back, where it inserts into a thick
connective tissue shealth called an aponeurosis.
