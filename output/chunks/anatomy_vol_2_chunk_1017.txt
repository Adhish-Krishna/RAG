The internodal pathways consist of three bands
(anterior, middle, and posterior) that lead directly from the SA node to the next node in the conduction system, the
atrioventricular node (see Figure 19.18). The impulse takes approximately 50 ms (milliseconds) to travel between these two

nodes. The relative importance of this pathway has been debated since the impulse would reach the atrioventricular node
simply following the cell-by-cell pathway through the contractile cells of the myocardium in the atria. In addition, there
is a specialized pathway called Bachmannâ€™s bundle or the interatrial band that conducts the impulse directly from the
right atrium to the left atrium. Regardless of the pathway, as the impulse reaches the atrioventricular septum, the connective
tissue of the cardiac skeleton prevents the impulse from spreading into the myocardial cells in the ventricles except at the
atrioventricular node.
