The structural classifications are either based on the anatomy of the
cell that is interacting with the stimulus (free nerve endings, encapsulated endings, or specialized receptor cell), or where
the cell is located relative to the stimulus (interoceptor, exteroceptor, proprioceptor). Thirdly, the functional classification
is based on how the cell transduces the stimulus into a neural signal. Chemoreceptors respond to chemical stimuli and
are the basis for olfaction and gustation. Related to chemoreceptors are osmoreceptors and nociceptors for fluid balance
and pain reception, respectively. Mechanoreceptors respond to mechanical stimuli and are the basis for most aspects of
somatosensation, as well as being the basis of audition and equilibrium in the inner ear. Thermoreceptors are sensitive to
temperature changes, and photoreceptors are sensitive to light energy.

 The nerves that convey sensory information from the periphery to the CNS are either spinal nerves, connected to the
spinal cord, or cranial nerves, connected to the brain.
