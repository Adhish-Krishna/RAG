Underneath the thin skin of the nose are its skeletal features (see Figure 22.3, lower illustration). While the root and
bridge of the nose consist of bone, the protruding portion of the nose is composed of cartilage. As a result, when looking
at a skull, the nose is missing. The nasal bone is one of a pair of bones that lies under the root and bridge of the nose. The
nasal bone articulates superiorly with the frontal bone and laterally with the maxillary bones. Septal cartilage is flexible
hyaline cartilage connected to the nasal bone, forming the dorsum nasi. The alar cartilage consists of the apex of the nose;
it surrounds the naris.

 The nares open into the nasal cavity, which is separated into left and right sections by the nasal septum (Figure 22.4).
 The nasal septum is formed anteriorly by a portion of the septal cartilage (the flexible portion you can touch with your
fingers) and posteriorly by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone (a cranial bone located just posterior to the nasal
bones) and the thin vomer bones (whose name refers to its plough shape).
