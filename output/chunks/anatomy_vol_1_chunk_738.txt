It consists of the rounded calvaria and a complex base. The brain case is formed by eight
bones, the paired parietal and temporal bones plus the unpaired frontal, occipital, sphenoid, and ethmoid bones. The narrow
gap between the bones is filled with dense, fibrous connective tissue that unites the bones. The sagittal suture joins the right
and left parietal bones. The coronal suture joins the parietal bones to the frontal bone, the lamboid suture joins them to the
occipital bone, and the squamous suture joins them to the temporal bone.
 The facial bones support the facial structures and form the upper and lower jaws. These consist of 14 bones, with the
paired maxillary, palatine, zygomatic, nasal, lacrimal, and inferior conchae bones and the unpaired vomer and mandible
bones. The ethmoid bone also contributes to the formation of facial structures. The maxilla forms the upper jaw and the
mandible forms the lower jaw. The maxilla also forms the larger anterior portion of the hard palate, which is completed by
the smaller palatine bones that form the posterior portion of the hard palate.
