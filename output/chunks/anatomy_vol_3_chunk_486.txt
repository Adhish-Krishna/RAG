This amount equates to a volume of about 180
L/day in men and 150 L/day in women. Ninety-nine percent of this filtrate is returned to the circulation by reabsorption so
that only about 1-2 liters of urine are produced per day (Table 25.4).

Cardiac output is about 5000 mL/minute, of which 21 percent flows through the
Renal kidney.

5000*0.21 = 1050 mL blood/min

Renal plasma flow equals the blood flow per minute times the hematocrit.
