You saw the only other portal system with the
hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal vessel in the endocrine chapter.

 The hepatic portal system consists of the hepatic portal vein and the veins that drain into it. The hepatic portal vein
itself is relatively short, beginning at the level of L2 with the confluence of the superior mesenteric and splenic veins. It also
receives branches from the inferior mesenteric vein, plus the splenic veins and all their tributaries. The superior mesenteric
vein receives blood from the small intestine, two-thirds of the large intestine, and the stomach. The inferior mesenteric vein
drains the distal third of the large intestine, including the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, and the rectum. The splenic
vein is formed from branches from the spleen, pancreas, and portions of the stomach, and the inferior mesenteric vein. After
its formation, the hepatic portal vein also receives branches from the gastric veins of the stomach and cystic veins from the
gall bladder.
