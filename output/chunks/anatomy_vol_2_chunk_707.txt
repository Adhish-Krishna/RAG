For example, when growth hormone-inhibiting hormone (GHIH), also known as somatostatin, binds to its receptors in the
pituitary gland, the level of cAMP decreases, thereby inhibiting the secretion of human growth hormone.

 Not all water-soluble hormones initiate the cAMP second messenger system. One common alternative system uses
calcium ions as a second messenger. In this system, G proteins activate the enzyme phospholipase C (PLC), which
functions similarly to adenylyl cyclase. Once activated, PLC cleaves a membrane-bound phospholipid into two molecules:
diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3). Like cAMP, DAG activates protein kinases that initiate a
phosphorylation cascade. At the same time, IP3 causes calcium ions to be released from storage sites within the cytosol, such
as from within the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The calcium ions then act as second messengers in two ways: they can
influence enzymatic and other cellular activities directly, or they can bind to calcium-binding proteins, the most common
of which is calmodulin.
