There are eight pairs of
cervical nerves designated C1 to C8, twelve thoracic nerves designated T1 to T12, five pairs of lumbar nerves designated
L1 to LS, five pairs of sacral nerves designated S1 to S5, and one pair of coccygeal nerves. The nerves are numbered from
the superior to inferior positions, and each emerges from the vertebral column through the intervertebral foramen at its
level. The first nerve, C1, emerges between the first cervical vertebra and the occipital bone. The second nerve, C2, emerges
between the first and second cervical vertebrae. The same occurs for C3 to C7, but C8 emerges between the seventh cervical
vertebra and the first thoracic vertebra. For the thoracic and lumbar nerves, each one emerges between the vertebra that
has the same designation and the next vertebra in the column. The sacral nerves emerge from the sacral foramina along the
length of that unique vertebra.

 Spinal nerves extend outward from the vertebral column to enervate the periphery.
