The
patella glides along a groove on the anterior side of the
distal femur. The collateral ligaments on the sides of the
knee become tight in the fully extended position to help
stabilize the knee. The posterior cruciate ligament supports
the knee when flexed and the anterior cruciate ligament
becomes tight when the knee comes into full extension to
resist hyperextension. What are the ligaments that support
the knee joint?

sliding too far forward in relation to the femur and which
ligament keeps the tibia from sliding too far backward?
