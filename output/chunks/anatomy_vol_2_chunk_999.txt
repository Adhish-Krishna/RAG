 Heart: Myocardial Infarction

Myocardial infarction (MI) is the formal term for what is commonly referred to as a heart attack. It normally results
from a lack of blood flow (ischemia) and oxygen (hypoxia) to a region of the heart, resulting in death of the cardiac
muscle cells. An MI often occurs when a coronary artery is blocked by the buildup of atherosclerotic plaque consisting
of lipids, cholesterol and fatty acids, and white blood cells, primarily macrophages. It can also occur when a portion of
an unstable atherosclerotic plaque travels through the coronary arterial system and lodges in one of the smaller vessels.
 The resulting blockage restricts the flow of blood and oxygen to the myocardium and causes death of the tissue.
