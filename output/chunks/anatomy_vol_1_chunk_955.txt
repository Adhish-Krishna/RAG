Acting via the patella and patellar ligament, the quadriceps femoris is a powerful
muscle that acts to extend the leg at the knee. It also serves as a “dynamic ligament” to provide very important support and
stabilization for the knee joint.

 The medial and lateral tibiofemoral joints are the articulations between the rounded condyles of the femur and the
relatively flat condyles of the tibia. During flexion and extension motions, the condyles of the femur both roll and glide over
the surfaces of the tibia. The rolling action produces flexion or extension, while the gliding action serves to maintain the
femoral condyles centered over the tibial condyles, thus ensuring maximal bony, weight-bearing support for the femur in all
knee positions. As the knee comes into full extension, the femur undergoes a slight medial rotation in relation to tibia. The
rotation results because the lateral condyle of the femur is slightly smaller than the medial condyle. Thus, the lateral condyle
finishes its rolling motion first, followed by the medial condyle.
