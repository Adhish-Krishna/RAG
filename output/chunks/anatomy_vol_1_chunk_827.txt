The anterior apex of
MH this triangle forms the anterior border of the tibia, which begins at the tibial tuberosity and runs inferiorly along
the length of the tibia. Both the anterior border and the medial side of the triangular shaft are located immediately under the
skin and can be easily palpated along the entire length of the tibia. A small ridge running down the lateral side of the tibial
shaft is the interosseous border of the tibia. This is for the attachment of the interosseous membrane of the leg, the sheet
of dense connective tissue that unites the tibia and fibula bones. Located on the posterior side of the tibia is the soleal line,
a diagonally running, roughened ridge that begins below the base of the lateral condyle, and runs down and medially across
the proximal third of the posterior tibia.
