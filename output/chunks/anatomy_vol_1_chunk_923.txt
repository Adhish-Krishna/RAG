thigh forward and upward is flexion at the hip joint, while any posterior-going motion of the thigh is extension. Note that
extension of the thigh beyond the anatomical (standing) position is greatly limited by the ligaments that support the hip
joint. Knee flexion is the bending of the knee to bring the foot toward the posterior thigh, and extension is the straightening
of the knee. Flexion and extension movements are seen at the hinge, condyloid, saddle, and ball-and-socket joints of the
limbs (see Figure 9.12a-d).

 Hyperextension is the abnormal or excessive extension of a joint beyond its normal range of motion, thus resulting in
injury. Similarly, hyperflexion is excessive flexion at a joint. Hyperextension injuries are common at hinge joints such as
the knee or elbow. In cases of “whiplash” in which the head is suddenly moved backward and then forward, a patient may
experience both hyperextension and hyperflexion of the cervical region.
