The telencephalon is the cerebrum, which is the major
portion of the human brain. The diencephalon continues to be referred to by this Greek name, because there is no better
term for it (dia- = “through”). The diencephalon is between the cerebrum and the rest of the nervous system and can be
described as the region through which all projections have to pass between the cerebrum and everything else. The brain stem
includes the midbrain, pons, and medulla, which correspond to the mesencephalon, metencephalon, and myelencephalon.
 The cerebellum, being a large portion of the brain, is considered a separate region. Table 13.1 connects the different stages
of development to the adult structures of the CNS.

 One other benefit of considering embryonic development is that certain connections are more obvious because of
how these adult structures are related. The retina, which began as part of the diencephalon, is primarily connected to the
diencephalon.
