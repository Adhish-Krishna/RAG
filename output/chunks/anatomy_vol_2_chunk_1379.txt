Extracellular antigens, characteristic of many bacteria, parasites, and fungi that do not replicate inside the cellâ€™s
cytoplasm, are brought into the endomembrane system of the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The resulting vesicle
fuses with vesicles from the Golgi complex, which contain pre-formed MHC class II molecules. After fusion of these two
vesicles and the association of antigen and MHC, the new vesicle makes its way to the cell surface.

 Professional Antigen-presenting Cells

Many cell types express class I molecules for the presentation of intracellular antigens. These MHC molecules may then
stimulate a cytotoxic T cell immune response, eventually destroying the cell and the pathogen within. This is especially
important when it comes to the most common class of intracellular pathogens, the virus. Viruses infect nearly every tissue
of the body, so all these tissues must necessarily be able to express class I MHC or no T cell response can be made.
