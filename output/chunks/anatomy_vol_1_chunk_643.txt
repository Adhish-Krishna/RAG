Inside the skull, the base is
subdivided into three large spaces, called the anterior cranial fossa, middle cranial fossa, and posterior cranial fossa
(fossa = “trench or ditch”) (Figure 7.6). From anterior to posterior, the fossae increase in depth. The shape and depth of each
fossa corresponds to the shape and size of the brain region that each houses. The boundaries and openings of the cranial
fossae (singular = fossa) will be described in a later section.
