Figure 23.32 Digestive Secretions and Absorption of Water Absorption is a complex process, in which nutrients
from digested food are harvested.

 Absorption can occur through five mechanisms: (1) active transport, (2) passive diffusion, (3) facilitated diffusion, (4)
co-transport (or secondary active transport), and (5) endocytosis. As you will recall from Chapter 3, active transport refers
to the movement of a substance across a cell membrane going from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher
concentration (up the concentration gradient). In this type of transport, proteins within the cell membrane act as “pumps,”
using cellular energy (ATP) to move the substance. Passive diffusion refers to the movement of substances from an area
of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, while facilitated diffusion refers to the movement of substances
from an area of higher to an area of lower concentration using a carrier protein in the cell membrane.
