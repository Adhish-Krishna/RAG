retraction posterior motion of the scapula or mandible

rotation movement of a bone around a central axis (atlantoaxial joint) or around its long axis (proximal radioulnar joint;
shoulder or hip joint); twisting of the vertebral column resulting from the summation of small motions between
adjacent vertebrae

rotator cuff strong connective tissue structure formed by the fusion of four rotator cuff muscle tendons to the articular
capsule of the shoulder joint; surrounds and supports superior, anterior, lateral, and posterior sides of the humeral
head

saddle joint synovial joint in which the articulating ends of both bones are convex and concave in shape, such as at the
first carpometacarpal joint at the base of the thumb; functionally classified as a biaxial joint

subacromial bursa bursa that protects the supraspinatus muscle tendon and superior end of the humerus from rubbing
against the acromion of the scapula

subcutaneous bursa bursa that prevents friction between skin and an underlying bone
submuscular bursa bursa that prevents friction between bone and a muscle or between adjacent muscles
subscapular bursa bursa that prevents rubbing of the subscapularis muscle tendon against the scapula

subtalar joint articulation between the talus and calcaneus bones of the foot; allows motions that contribute to
inversion/eversion of the foot

subtendinous bursa bursa that prevents friction between bone and a muscle tendon

superior rotation movement of the scapula during upper limb abduction in which the glenoid cavity of the scapula
moves in an upward direction as the medial end of the scapular spine moves in a downward direction

supinated position forearm position in which the palm faces anteriorly (anatomical position)

supination forearm motion that moves the palm of the hand from the palm backward to the palm forward position
suture fibrous joint that connects the bones of the skull (except the mandible); an immobile joint (synarthrosis)
symphysis type of cartilaginous joint where the bones are joined by fibrocartilage

synarthrosis immobile or nearly immobile joint

synchondrosis type of cartilaginous joint where the bones are joined by hyaline cartilage

syndesmosis type of fibrous joint in which two separated, parallel bones are connected by an interosseous membrane
synostosis site at which adjacent bones or bony components have fused together

synovial fluid thick, lubricating fluid that fills the interior of a synovial joint

synovial joint joint at which the articulating surfaces of the bones are located within a joint cavity formed by an
articular capsule

synovial membrane thin layer that lines the inner surface of the joint cavity at a synovial joint; produces the synovial
fluid

talocrural joint ankle joint; articulation between the talus bone of the foot and medial malleolus of the tibia, distal tibia,
and lateral malleolus of the fibula; a uniaxial hinge joint that allows only for dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of the
foot

temporomandibular joint (TMJ) articulation between the condyle of the mandible and the mandibular fossa and
articular tubercle of the temporal bone of the skull; allows for depression/elevation (opening/closing of mouth),
protraction/retraction, and side-to-side motions of the mandible

tendon sheath connective tissue that surrounds a tendon at places where the tendon crosses a joint; contains a
lubricating fluid to prevent friction and allow smooth movements of the tendon

tendon dense connective tissue structure that anchors a muscle to bone

tibial collateral ligament extrinsic ligament of knee joint that spans from the medial epicondyle of the femur to the
medial tibia; resists hyperextension and rotation of extended knee

ulnar collateral ligament intrinsic ligament on the medial side of the elbow joint; spans from the medial epicondyle
of the humerus to the medial ulna

uniaxial joint type of diarthrosis; joint that allows for motion within only one plane (one axis)

zygapophysial joints facet joints; plane joints between the superior and inferior articular processes of adjacent
vertebrae that provide for only limited motions between the vertebrae

CHAPTER REVIEW

9.1 Classification of Joints

Structural classifications of the body joints are based on how the bones are held together and articulate with each other.
