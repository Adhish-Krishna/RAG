The anterior talofibular ligament is most commonly
injured, followed by the calcaneofibular ligament. In severe inversion injuries, the forceful lateral movement of the
talus not only ruptures the lateral ankle ligaments, but also fractures the distal fibula.

 Less common are eversion sprains of the ankle, which involve stretching of the deltoid ligament on the medial
side of the ankle. Forcible eversion of the foot, for example, with an awkward landing from a jump or when a football
player has a foot planted and is hit on the lateral ankle, can result in a Pottâ€™s fracture and dislocation of the ankle joint.
 In this injury, the very strong deltoid ligament does not tear, but instead shears off the medial malleolus of the tibia.
 This frees the talus, which moves laterally and fractures the distal fibula. In extreme cases, the posterior margin of the
tibia may also be sheared off.

 Above the ankle, the distal ends of the tibia and fibula are united by a strong syndesmosis formed by the
interosseous membrane and ligaments at the distal tibiofibular joint.
