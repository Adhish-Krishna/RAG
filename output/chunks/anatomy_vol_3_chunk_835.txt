The most obvious anatomical sign of pregnancy is the dramatic enlargement of the abdominal region, coupled with maternal
weight gain. This weight results from the growing fetus as well as the enlarged uterus, amniotic fluid, and placenta.
 Additional breast tissue and dramatically increased blood volume also contribute to weight gain (Table 28.2). Surprisingly,
fat storage accounts for only approximately 2.3 kg (5 lbs) in a normal pregnancy and serves as a reserve for the increased
metabolic demand of breastfeeding.

 During the first trimester, the mother does not need to consume additional calories to maintain a healthy pregnancy.
 However, a weight gain of approximately 0.45 kg (1 lb) per month is common. During the second and third trimesters, the
motherâ€™s appetite increases, but it is only necessary for her to consume an additional 300 calories per day to support the
growing fetus.
