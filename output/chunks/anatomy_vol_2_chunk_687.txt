As a result, the nervous system can cause rapid endocrine responses to keep up with sudden changes in both the external
and internal environments when necessary.

Structures of the Endocrine System

The endocrine system consists of cells, tissues, and organs that secrete hormones as a primary or secondary function.
 The endocrine gland is the major player in this system. The primary function of these ductless glands is to secrete their
hormones directly into the surrounding fluid. The interstitial fluid and the blood vessels then transport the hormones
throughout the body. The endocrine system includes the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, and pineal glands (Figure
17.2).
