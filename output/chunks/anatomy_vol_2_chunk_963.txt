From superficial to deep, these are the epicardium,
the myocardium, and the endocardium (see Figure 19.5). The outermost layer of the wall of the heart is also the innermost
layer of the pericardium, the epicardium, or the visceral pericardium discussed earlier.

 The middle and thickest layer is the myocardium, made largely of cardiac muscle cells. It is built upon a framework
of collagenous fibers, plus the blood vessels that supply the myocardium and the nerve fibers that help regulate the heart.
 It is the contraction of the myocardium that pumps blood through the heart and into the major arteries. The muscle pattern
is elegant and complex, as the muscle cells swirl and spiral around the chambers of the heart. They form a figure 8 pattern
around the atria and around the bases of the great vessels. Deeper ventricular muscles also form a figure 8 around the two
ventricles and proceed toward the apex. More superficial layers of ventricular muscle wrap around both ventricles.
