The paired ejaculatory
ducts transport the seminal fluid into the next structure, the prostate gland.

 Prostate Gland

As shown in Figure 27.2, the centrally located prostate gland sits anterior to the rectum at the base of the bladder
surrounding the prostatic urethra (the portion of the urethra that runs within the prostate). About the size of a walnut,
the prostate is formed of both muscular and glandular tissues. It excretes an alkaline, milky fluid to the passing seminal
fluid—now called semen—that is critical to first coagulate and then decoagulate the semen following ejaculation. The
temporary thickening of semen helps retain it within the female reproductive tract, providing time for sperm to utilize the
fructose provided by seminal vesicle secretions. When the semen regains its fluid state, sperm can then pass farther into the
female reproductive tract.
 The prostate normally doubles in size during puberty. At approximately age 25, it gradually begins to enlarge
again. This enlargement does not usually cause problems; however, abnormal growth of the prostate, or benign prostatic
hyperplasia (BPH), can cause constriction of the urethra as it passes through the middle of the prostate gland, leading to
a number of lower urinary tract symptoms, such as a frequent and intense urge to urinate, a weak stream, and a sensation
that the bladder has not emptied completely.
