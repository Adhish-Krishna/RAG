Made in the liver, they have a variety of functions in the innate immune response, using what is known
as the “alternate pathway” of complement activation. Additionally, complement functions in the adaptive immune response
as well, in what is called the classical pathway. The complement system consists of several proteins that enzymatically
alter and fragment later proteins in a series, which is why it is termed cascade. Once activated, the series of reactions is
irreversible, and releases fragments that have the following actions:

* Bind to the cell membrane of the pathogen that activates it, labeling it for phagocytosis (opsonization)

* Diffuse away from the pathogen and act as chemotactic agents to attract phagocytic cells to the site of inflammation

¢ Form damaging pores in the plasma membrane of the pathogen

Figure 21.13 shows the classical pathway, which requires antibodies of the adaptive immune response.
