The retinal molecule has two isomers, (a) one before a photon interacts with it and (b)
one that is altered through photoisomerization.

 The opsins are sensitive to limited wavelengths of light. Rhodopsin, the photopigment in rods, is most sensitive to light
at a wavelength of 498 nm. The three color opsins have peak sensitivities of 564 nm, 534 nm, and 420 nm corresponding
roughly to the primary colors of red, green, and blue (Figure 14.18). The absorbance of rhodopsin in the rods is much more
sensitive than in the cone opsins; specifically, rods are sensitive to vision in low light conditions, and cones are sensitive
to brighter conditions. In normal sunlight, rhodopsin will be constantly bleached while the cones are active. In a darkened
room, there is not enough light to activate cone opsins, and vision is entirely dependent on rods. Rods are so sensitive to
light that a single photon can result in an action potential from a rodâ€™s corresponding RGC.
