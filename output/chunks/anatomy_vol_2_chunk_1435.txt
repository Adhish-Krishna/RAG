Allergists use skin testing to identify allergens in type I hypersensitivity. In skin testing, allergen extracts are injected
into the epidermis, and a positive result of a soft, pale swelling at the site surrounded by a red zone (called the wheal and
flare response), caused by the release of histamine and the granule mediators, usually occurs within 30 minutes. The soft
center is due to fluid leaking from the blood vessels and the redness is caused by the increased blood flow to the area that
results from the dilation of local blood vessels at the site.

 Type Il and Type Ill Hypersensitivities

Type II hypersensitivity, which involves IgG-mediated lysis of cells by complement proteins, occurs during mismatched
blood transfusions and blood compatibility diseases such as erythroblastosis fetalis (see section on transplantation). Type
III hypersensitivity occurs with diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, where soluble antigens, mostly DNA and
other material from the nucleus, and antibodies accumulate in the blood to the point that the antigen and antibody precipitate
along blood vessel linings.
