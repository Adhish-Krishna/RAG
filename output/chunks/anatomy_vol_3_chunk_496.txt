This control is exerted directly by ADH and aldosterone, and indirectly by renin. Most water is
recovered in the PCT, loop of Henle, and DCT. About 10 percent (about 18 L) reaches the collecting ducts. The collecting
ducts, under the influence of ADH, can recover almost all of the water passing through them, in cases of dehydration, or
almost none of the water, in cases of over-hydration.
