The number of sperm that reach the oocyte is greatly reduced because of conditions within the female reproductive
tract. Many sperm are overcome by the acidity of the vagina, others are blocked by mucus in the cervix, whereas others
are attacked by phagocytic leukocytes in the uterus. Those sperm that do survive undergo a change in response to those
conditions. They go through the process of capacitation, which improves their motility and alters the membrane surrounding
the acrosome, the cap-like structure in the head of a sperm that contains the digestive enzymes needed for it to attach to and
penetrate the oocyte.

 The oocyte that is released by ovulation is protected by a thick outer layer of granulosa cells known as the corona
radiata and by the zona pellucida, a thick glycoprotein membrane that lies just outside the oocyteâ€™s plasma membrane.
