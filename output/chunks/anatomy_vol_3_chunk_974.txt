The anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments are located inside the knee joint. 15 The anterior cruciate ligament prevents
the tibia from sliding too far forward in relation to the femur and the posterior cruciate ligament keeps the tibia from sliding too
far backward. 16 The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is most commonly injured when traumatic force is applied to the knee
during a twisting motion or when side standing or landing from a jump. 17 The ligaments of the lateral ankle are the anterior
and posterior talofibular ligaments and the calcaneofibular ligament. These ligaments support the ankle joint and resist excess
inversion of the foot. 18 Because of the square shape of the ankle joint, it has been compared to a mortise-and-tendon type
of joint. 19 An inversion ankle sprain may injure all three ligaments located on the lateral side of the ankle. The sequence of
injury would be the anterior talofibular ligament first, followed by the calcaneofibular ligament second, and finally, the posterior
talofibular ligament third.
