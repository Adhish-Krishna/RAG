If the head rotates in one direction—for example, to the right—the horizontal pair of semicircular canals in the inner ear
indicate the movement by increased activity on the right and decreased activity on the left. The information is sent to the
abducens nuclei and oculomotor nuclei on either side to coordinate the lateral and medial rectus muscles. The left lateral
rectus and right medial rectus muscles will contract, rotating the eyes in the opposite direction of the head, while nuclei
controlling the right lateral rectus and left medial rectus muscles will be inhibited to reduce antagonism of the contracting
muscles. These actions stabilize the visual field by compensating for the head rotation with opposite rotation of the eyes in
the orbits. Deficits in the VOR may be related to vestibular damage, such as in Méniére’s disease, or from dorsal brain stem
damage that would affect the eye movement nuclei or their connections through the MLF.
