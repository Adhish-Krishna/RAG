Right-side damage can result in a loss of ability to understand figurative
aspects of speech, such as jokes, irony, or metaphors. Nonverbal aspects of speech can be affected by damage to the
right side, such as facial expression or body language, and right-side damage can lead to a “flat affect” in speech, or a
loss of emotional expression in speech—sounding like a robot when talking.

 The Diencephalon

The diencephalon is the one region of the adult brain that retains its name from embryologic development. The etymology
of the word diencephalon translates to “through brain.” It is the connection between the cerebrum and the rest of the nervous
system, with one exception. The rest of the brain, the spinal cord, and the PNS all send information to the cerebrum through
the diencephalon. Output from the cerebrum passes through the diencephalon. The single exception is the system associated
with olfaction, or the sense of smell, which connects directly with the cerebrum.
