In the kidney, most of the CA is located
within the cell, but a small amount is bound to the brush border of the membrane on the apical surface of the cell. In the
lumen of the PCT, HCO3 combines with hydrogen ions to form carbonic acid (H2CO3). This is enzymatically catalyzed
into CO2 and water, which diffuse across the apical membrane into the cell. Water can move osmotically across the lipid
bilayer membrane due to the presence of aquaporin water channels. Inside the cell, the reverse reaction occurs to produce

bicarbonate ions (HCO3 ). These bicarbonate ions are cotransported with Na’ across the basal membrane to the interstitial

space around the PCT (Figure 25.19). At the same time this is occurring, a Na*/H" antiporter excretes H* into the lumen,

while it recovers Na”. Note how the hydrogen ion is recycled so that bicarbonate can be recovered. Also, note that a Na”

gradient is created by the Na*/K* pump.
