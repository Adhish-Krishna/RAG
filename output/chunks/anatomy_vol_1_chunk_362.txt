The cell contains an array of cellular organelles,
each one performing a unique function and helping to maintain the health and activity of the cell. The cytosol and organelles
together compose the cellâ€™s cytoplasm. Most organelles are surrounded by a lipid membrane similar to the cell membrane
of the cell. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes share a functional connectivity and are
collectively referred to as the endomembrane system. There are two types of ER: smooth and rough. While the smooth ER
performs many functions, including lipid synthesis and ion storage, the rough ER is mainly responsible for protein synthesis
using its associated ribosomes. The rough ER sends newly made proteins to the Golgi apparatus where they are modified
and packaged for delivery to various locations within or outside of the cell. Some of these protein products are enzymes
destined to break down unwanted material and are packaged as lysosomes for use inside the cell.
