Figure 18.14 Hemostasis (a) An injury to a blood vessel initiates the process of hemostasis. Blood clotting involves
three steps. First, vascular spasm constricts the flow of blood. Next, a platelet plug forms to temporarily seal small
openings in the vessel. Coagulation then enables the repair of the vessel wall once the leakage of blood has stopped.
 (b) The synthesis of fibrin in blood clots involves either an intrinsic pathway or an extrinsic pathway, both of which lead
to acommon pathway. (credit a: Kevin MacKenzie)

 Clotting Factors Involved in Coagulation

 In the coagulation cascade, chemicals called clotting factors (or coagulation factors) prompt reactions that activate still
more coagulation factors.
