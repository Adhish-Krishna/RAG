It also gives bony protections for
the brain, spinal cord, heart, and lungs; stores fat and minerals; and houses the blood-cell producing tissue. 29 The brain case is
that portion of the skull that surrounds and protects the brain. It is subdivided into the rounded top of the skull, called the calvaria,
and the base of the skull. There are eight bones that form the brain case. These are the paired parietal and temporal bones, plus
the unpaired frontal, occipital, sphenoid, and ethmoid bones. The facial bones support the facial structures, and form the upper and
lower jaws, nasal cavity, nasal septum, and orbit. There are 14 facial bones. These are the paired maxillary, palatine, zygomatic,
nasal, lacrimal, and inferior nasal conchae bones, and the unpaired vomer and mandible bones. 30 The coronal suture passes
across the top of the anterior skull. It unites the frontal bone anteriorly with the right and left parietal bones.
