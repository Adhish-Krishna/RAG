You are probably familiar with prescription and over-the-counter medications containing glucocorticoids, such as
cortisone injections into inflamed joints, prednisone tablets and steroid-based inhalers used to manage severe asthma, and
hydrocortisone creams applied to relieve itchy skin rashes. These drugs reflect another role of cortisolâ€”the downregulation
of the immune system, which inhibits the inflammatory response.

 Hormones of the Zona Reticularis

The deepest region of the adrenal cortex is the zona reticularis, which produces small amounts of a class of steroid sex
hormones called androgens. During puberty and most of adulthood, androgens are produced in the gonads. The androgens
produced in the zona reticularis supplement the gonadal androgens. They are produced in response to ACTH from the
anterior pituitary and are converted in the tissues to testosterone or estrogens. In adult women, they may contribute to the
sex drive, but their function in adult men is not well understood.
