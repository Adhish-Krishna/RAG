However, the somatosensory
pathways are divided into two separate systems on the basis of the location of the receptor neurons. Somatosensory stimuli
from below the neck pass along the sensory pathways of the spinal cord, whereas somatosensory stimuli from the head and
neck travel through the cranial nerves—specifically, the trigeminal system.
 The dorsal column system (sometimes referred to as the dorsal column—medial lemniscus) and the spinothalamic
tract are two major pathways that bring sensory information to the brain (Figure 14.19). The sensory pathways in each o
these systems are composed of three successive neurons.
 The dorsal column system begins with the axon of a dorsal root ganglion neuron entering the dorsal root and joining the
dorsal column white matter in the spinal cord. As axons of this pathway enter the dorsal column, they take on a positional
arrangement so that axons from lower levels of the body position themselves medially, whereas axons from upper levels o
the body position themselves laterally.
