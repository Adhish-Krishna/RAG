Stage 1: Initiation. A region at the beginning of the gene called a promoter—a particular sequence of
nucleotides—triggers the start of transcription.

 Stage 2: Elongation. Transcription starts when RNA polymerase unwinds the DNA segment. One strand, referred to
as the coding strand, becomes the template with the genes to be coded. The polymerase then aligns the correct nucleic acid
(A, C, G, or U) with its complementary base on the coding strand of DNA. RNA polymerase is an enzyme that adds new
nucleotides to a growing strand of RNA. This process builds a strand of mRNA.

 Stage 3: Termination. When the polymerase has reached the end of the gene, one of three specific triplets (UAA, UAG,
or UGA) codes a “stop” signal, which triggers the enzymes to terminate transcription and release the mRNA transcript.
