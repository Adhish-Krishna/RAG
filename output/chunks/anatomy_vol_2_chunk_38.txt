Gray matter is not necessarily gray. It can be pinkish because of
blood content, or even slightly tan, depending on how long the tissue has been preserved. But white matter is white because
axons are insulated by a lipid-rich substance called myelin. Lipids can appear as white (“fatty”) material, much like the fat
on a raw piece of chicken or beef. Actually, gray matter may have that color ascribed to it because next to the white matter,
it is just darker—hence, gray.

 The distinction between gray matter and white matter is most often applied to central nervous tissue, which has large
regions that can be seen with the unaided eye. When looking at peripheral structures, often a microscope is used and the
tissue is stained with artificial colors. That is not to say that central nervous tissue cannot be stained and viewed under a
microscope, but unstained tissue is most likely from the CNS—for example, a frontal section of the brain or cross section
of the spinal cord.
