This “self-destruct” mechanism is called autolysis, and makes the process of cell death controlled (a mechanism called
“apoptosis”).

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/endomembrane1) to learn about the endomembrane system, which

includes the rough and smooth ER and the Golgi body as well as lysosomes and vesicles. What is the primary role of
the endomembrane system?

Organelles for Energy Production and Detoxification

 In addition to the jobs performed by the endomembrane system, the cell has many other important functions. Just as you
must consume nutrients to provide yourself with energy, so must each of your cells take in nutrients, some of which convert
to chemical energy that can be used to power biochemical reactions. Another important function of the cell is detoxification.
 Humans take in all sorts of toxins from the environment and also produce harmful chemicals as byproducts of cellular
processes.
