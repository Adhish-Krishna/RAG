Thus tRNA transfers specific amino
acids from the cytoplasm to a growing polypeptide. The tRNA molecules must be able to recognize the codons on MRNA
and match them with the correct amino acid. The tRNA is modified for this function. On one end of its structure is a binding
site for a specific amino acid. On the other end is a base sequence that matches the codon specifying its particular amino
acid. This sequence of three bases on the tRNA molecule is called an anticodon. For example, a tRNA responsible for
shuttling the amino acid glycine contains a binding site for glycine on one end. On the other end it contains an anticodon
that complements the glycine codon (GGA is a codon for glycine, and so the tRNAs anticodon would read CCU). Equipped
with its particular cargo and matching anticodon, a tRNA molecule can read its recognized mRNA codon and bring the
corresponding amino acid to the growing chain (Figure 3.28).
