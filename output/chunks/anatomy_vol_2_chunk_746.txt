Marine fish and shrimp tend to have high
levels because they concentrate iodine from seawater, but many people in landlocked regions lack access to seafood.
 Thus, the primary source of dietary iodine in many countries is iodized salt. Fortification of salt with iodine began in
the United States in 1924, and international efforts to iodize salt in the worldâ€™s poorest nations continue today.

 Dietary iodine deficiency can result in the impaired ability to synthesize T3 and T4, leading to a variety of
severe disorders. When T3 and T4 cannot be produced, TSH is secreted in increasing amounts. As a result of this
hyperstimulation, thyroglobulin accumulates in the thyroid gland follicles, increasing their deposits of colloid. The
accumulation of colloid increases the overall size of the thyroid gland, a condition called a goiter (Figure 17.14).
 A goiter is only a visible indication of the deficiency. Other iodine deficiency disorders include impaired growth
and development, decreased fertility, and prenatal and infant death.
