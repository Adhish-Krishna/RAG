The dynamics of capsaicin binding with this transmembrane ion channel is unusual in that the
molecule remains bound for a long time. Because of this, it will decrease the ability of other stimuli to elicit pain sensations
through the activated nociceptor. For this reason, capsaicin can be used as a topical analgesic, such as in products such as
Icy Hotâ„¢.

 If you drag your finger across a textured surface, the skin of your finger will vibrate. Such low frequency vibrations are
sensed by mechanoreceptors called Merkel cells, also known as type I cutaneous mechanoreceptors. Merkel cells are located
in the stratum basale of the epidermis. Deep pressure and vibration is transduced by lamellated (Pacinian) corpuscles, which
are receptors with encapsulated endings found deep in the dermis, or subcutaneous tissue. Light touch is transduced by the
encapsulated endings known as tactile (Meissner) corpuscles. Follicles are also wrapped in a plexus of nerve endings known
as the hair follicle plexus.
