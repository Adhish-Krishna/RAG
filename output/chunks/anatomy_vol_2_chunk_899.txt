The calcium ion, considered factor IV, is derived from the diet and
from the breakdown of bone. Some recent evidence indicates that activation of various clotting factors occurs on specific
receptor sites on the surfaces of platelets.

 The 12 clotting factors are numbered | through XIII according to the order of their discovery. Factor VI was once
believed to be a distinct clotting factor, but is now thought to be identical to factor V. Rather than renumber the other factors,
factor VI was allowed to remain as a placeholder and also a reminder that knowledge changes over time.
