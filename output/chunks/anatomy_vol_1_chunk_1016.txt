Inside each fascicle, each muscle fiber is encased in a thin connective tissue layer of collagen
and reticular fibers called the endomysium. The endomysium contains the extracellular fluid and nutrients to support the
muscle fiber. These nutrients are supplied via blood to the muscle tissue.

 In skeletal muscles that work with tendons to pull on bones, the collagen in the three tissue layers (the mysia)
intertwines with the collagen of a tendon. At the other end of the tendon, it fuses with the periosteum coating the bone.
 The tension created by contraction of the muscle fibers is then transferred though the mysia, to the tendon, and then to the
periosteum to pull on the bone for movement of the skeleton. In other places, the mysia may fuse with a broad, tendon-like
sheet called an aponeurosis, or to fascia, the connective tissue between skin and bones.
