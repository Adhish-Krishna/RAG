A peptide, in fact, is a very short chain of amino acids. Strands containing fewer than about 100
amino acids are generally referred to as polypeptides rather than proteins.

 Peptide Bond

Figure 2.25 Peptide Bond Different amino acids join together to form peptides, polypeptides, or proteins via
dehydration synthesis. The bonds between the amino acids are peptide bonds.

 The body is able to synthesize most of the amino acids from components of other molecules; however, nine cannot be
synthesized and have to be consumed in the diet. These are known as the essential amino acids.

 Free amino acids available for protein construction are said to reside in the amino acid pool within cells. Structures
within cells use these amino acids when assembling proteins. If a particular essential amino acid is not available in sufficient
quantities in the amino acid pool, however, synthesis of proteins containing it can slow or even cease.
