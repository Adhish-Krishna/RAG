The dorsal column is separated into two component tracts, the fasciculus gracilis
that contains axons from the legs and lower body, and the fasciculus cuneatus that contains axons from the upper body and
arms.

 The axons in the dorsal column terminate in the nuclei of the medulla, where each synapses with the second neuron in
their respective pathway. The nucleus gracilis is the target of fibers in the fasciculus gracilis, whereas the nucleus cuneatus
is the target of fibers in the fasciculus cuneatus. The second neuron in the system projects from one of the two nuclei and
then decussates, or crosses the midline of the medulla. These axons then continue to ascend the brain stem as a bundle
called the medial lemniscus. These axons terminate in the thalamus, where each synapses with the third neuron in their
respective pathway. The third neuron in the system projects its axons to the postcentral gyrus of the cerebral cortex, where
somatosensory stimuli are initially processed and the conscious perception of the stimulus occurs.
