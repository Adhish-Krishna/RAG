Furthermore, each defect on its own may not be a problem, but when several are added together, they
can disrupt growth processes that are not well understand in the first place. For instance, it is possible for a stroke to damage
a specific region of the brain and lead to the loss of the ability to recognize faces (prosopagnosia). The link between cell
death in the fusiform gyrus and the symptom is relatively easy to understand. In contrast, similar deficits can be seen in
children with the developmental disorder, autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, these children do not lack a fusiform
gyrus, nor is there any damage or defect visible to this brain region. We conclude, rather poorly, that this brain region is not
connected properly to other brain regions.

 Infection, trauma, and congenital disorders can all lead to significant signs, as identified through the neurological exam.
