The
placenta—a circulatory organ unique to pregnancy—develops jointly from the embryo and uterine wall structures to fill
this need. Emerging from the placenta is the umbilical vein, which carries oxygen-rich blood from the mother to the
fetal inferior vena cava via the ductus venosus to the heart that pumps it into fetal circulation. Two umbilical arteries
carry oxygen-depleted fetal blood, including wastes and carbon dioxide, to the placenta. Remnants of the umbilical arteries
remain in the adult. (Seek additional content for more information on the role of the placenta in fetal circulation.)

There are three major shunts—alternate paths for blood flow—found in the circulatory system of the fetus.
