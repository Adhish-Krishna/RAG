In order for the heart to maintain
adequate flow to overcome increasing afterload, it must pump more forcefully. This is one of the negative consequences of high
blood pressure or hypertension. 36 The human embryo is rapidly growing and has great demands for nutrients and oxygen, while
producing waste products including carbon dioxide. All of these materials must be received from or delivered to the mother for
processing. Without an efficient early circulatory system, this would be impossible. 37 After fusion of the two endocardial tubes
into the single primitive heart, five regions quickly become visible. From the head, these are the truncus arteriosus, bulbus cordis,
primitive ventricle, primitive atrium, and sinus venosus. Contractions propel the blood from the sinus venosus to the truncus
arteriosus. About day 23, the heart begins to form an S-shaped structure within the pericardium. The bulbus cordis develops into
the right ventricle, whereas the primitive ventricle becomes the left ventricle.
