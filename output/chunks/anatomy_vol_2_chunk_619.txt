The facial and glossopharyngeal nerves are also responsible for the initiation of salivation. Neurons in the salivary
nuclei of the medulla project through these two nerves as preganglionic fibers, and synapse in ganglia located in the head.
 The parasympathetic fibers of the facial nerve synapse in the pterygopalatine ganglion, which projects to the submandibular
gland and sublingual gland. The parasympathetic fibers of the glossopharyngeal nerve synapse in the otic ganglion, which
projects to the parotid gland. Salivation in response to food in the oral cavity is based on a visceral reflex arc within the

facial or glossopharyngeal nerves. Other stimuli that stimulate salivation are coordinated through the hypothalamus, such
as the smell and sight of food.

 The hypoglossal nerve is the motor nerve that controls the muscles of the tongue, except for the palatoglossus muscle,
which is controlled by the vagus nerve.
