The kidneys catalyze the final reaction in the synthesis of active vitamin D that in turn helps regulate

Ca**. The kidney hormone EPO stimulates erythrocyte development and promotes adequate O2 transport. The kidneys help

regulate blood pressure through Na* and water retention and loss. The kidneys work with the adrenal cortex, lungs, and liver
in the renin—angiotensin—aldosterone system to regulate blood pressure. They regulate osmolarity of the blood by regulating
both solutes and water. Three electrolytes are more closely regulated than others: Na*, Ca**, and K*. The kidneys share pH
regulation with the lungs and plasma buffers, so that proteins can preserve their three-dimensional conformation and thus
their function.
