Cranial Nerves

Cranial nerves convey specific sensory information from the head and neck directly to the brain. For sensations below the
neck, the right side of the body is connected to the left side of the brain and the left side of the body to the right side of the
brain. Whereas spinal information is contralateral, cranial nerve systems are mostly ipsilateral, meaning that a cranial nerve
on the right side of the head is connected to the right side of the brain. Some cranial nerves contain only sensory axons, such
as the olfactory, optic, and vestibulocochlear nerves. Other cranial nerves contain both sensory and motor axons, including
the trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves (however, the vagus nerve is not associated with the somatic
nervous system). The general senses of somatosensation for the face travel through the trigeminal system.

 14.2 | Central Processing

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the pathways that sensory systems follow into the central nervous system
¢ Differentiate between the two major ascending pathways in the spinal cord

* Describe the pathway of somatosensory input from the face and compare it to the ascending pathways in the spinal
cord
