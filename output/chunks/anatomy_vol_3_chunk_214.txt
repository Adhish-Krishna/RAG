Although you might think that the size of a person’s stomach is related to how much food
that individual consumes, body weight does not correlate with stomach size. Rather, when you eat greater quantities of
food—such as at holiday dinner—you stretch the stomach more than when you eat less.

Popular culture tends to refer to the stomach as the location where all digestion takes place. Of course, this is not true.
 An important function of the stomach is to serve as a temporary holding chamber. You can ingest a meal far more quickly
than it can be digested and absorbed by the small intestine. Thus, the stomach holds food and parses only small amounts
into the small intestine at a time. Foods are not processed in the order they are eaten; rather, they are mixed together with
digestive juices in the stomach until they are converted into chyme, which is released into the small intestine.
