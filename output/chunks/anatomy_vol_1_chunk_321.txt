The mechanism by which cells turn the DNA code into a protein
product is a two-step process, with an RNA molecule as the intermediate.

Figure 3.25 The Genetic Code DNA holds all of the genetic information necessary to build a cell’s proteins. The
nucleotide sequence of a gene is ultimately translated into an amino acid sequence of the gene’s corresponding
protein.

 From DNA to RNA: Transcription

DNA is housed within the nucleus, and protein synthesis takes place in the cytoplasm, thus there must be some sort o:
intermediate messenger that leaves the nucleus and manages protein synthesis.
