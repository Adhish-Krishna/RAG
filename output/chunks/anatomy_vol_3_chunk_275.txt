 Pancreatic duct

Exocrine cells secrete pancreatic juice.

 Figure 23.26 Exocrine and Endocrine Pancreas The pancreas has a head, a body, and a tail. It delivers pancreatic
juice to the duodenum through the pancreatic duct.

 The exocrine part of the pancreas arises as little grape-like cell clusters, each called an acinus (plural = acini), located
at the terminal ends of pancreatic ducts. These acinar cells secrete enzyme-rich pancreatic juice into tiny merging ducts that
â€˜orm two dominant ducts. The larger duct fuses with the common bile duct (carrying bile from the liver and gallbladder) just
before entering the duodenum via a common opening (the hepatopancreatic ampulla). The smooth muscle sphincter of the
hepatopancreatic ampulla controls the release of pancreatic juice and bile into the small intestine. The second and smaller
pancreatic duct, the accessory duct (duct of Santorini), runs from the pancreas directly into the duodenum, approximately
inch above the hepatopancreatic ampulla.
