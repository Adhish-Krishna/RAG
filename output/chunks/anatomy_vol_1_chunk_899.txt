This type of indirect support
by muscles is very important at the shoulder joint, for example, where the ligaments are relatively weak.

Additional Structures Associated with Synovial Joints

A few synovial joints of the body have a fibrocartilage structure located between the articulating bones. This is called an
articular disc, which is generally small and oval-shaped, or a meniscus, which is larger and C-shaped. These structures can
serve several functions, depending on the specific joint. In some places, an articular disc may act to strongly unite the bones
of the joint to each other. Examples of this include the articular discs found at the sternoclavicular joint or between the distal
ends of the radius and ulna bones. At other synovial joints, the disc can provide shock absorption and cushioning between
the bones, which is the function of each meniscus within the knee joint.
