Sensory feedback from the muscles and joints, proprioceptive information about the movements of walking,
and sensations of balance are sent to the cerebellum through the inferior olive and the cerebellum compares them. If walking
is not coordinated, perhaps because the ground is uneven or a strong wind is blowing, then the cerebellum sends out a
corrective command to compensate for the difference between the original cortical command and the sensory feedback. The
output of the cerebellum is into the midbrain, which then sends a descending input to the spinal cord to correct the messages
going to skeletal muscles.

 The Spinal Cord

The description of the CNS is concentrated on the structures of the brain, but the spinal cord is another major organ of the
system. Whereas the brain develops out of expansions of the neural tube into primary and then secondary vesicles, the spinal
cord maintains the tube structure and is only specialized into certain regions.
