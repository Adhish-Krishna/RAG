These preganglionic fibers also release ACh onto nicotinic receptors
to excite the ganglionic neurons. The postganglionic fibers then contact the target tissues within the organ to release ACh,
which binds to muscarinic receptors to induce rest-and-digest responses.
 Signaling molecules utilized by the autonomic nervous system are released from axons and can be considered as
either neurotransmitters (when they directly interact with the effector) or as hormones (when they are released into the
bloodstream). The same molecule, such as norepinephrine, could be considered either a neurotransmitter or a hormone on
the basis of whether it is released from a postganglionic sympathetic axon or from the adrenal gland. The synapses in the
autonomic system are not always the typical type of connection first described in the neuromuscular junction. Instead of
having synaptic end bulbs at the very end of an axonal fiber, they may have swellings—called varicosities—along the length
of a fiber so that it makes a network of connections within the target tissue.

15.2 Autonomic Reflexes and Homeostasis

Autonomic nervous system function is based on the visceral reflex.
