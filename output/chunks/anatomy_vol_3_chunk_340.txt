This six-carbon sugar is split to form two phosphorylated three-carbon molecules, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and
dihydroxyacetone phosphate, which are both converted into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
is further phosphorylated with groups donated by dihydrogen phosphate present in the cell to form the three-carbon
molecule 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. The energy of this reaction comes from the oxidation of (removal of electrons from)
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. In a series of reactions leading to pyruvate, the two phosphate groups are then transferred to
two ADPs to form two ATPs. Thus, glycolysis uses two ATPs but generates four ATPs, yielding a net gain of two ATPs and
two molecules of pyruvate. In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate continues on to the Krebs cycle (also called the citric acid
cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), where additional energy is extracted and passed on.
