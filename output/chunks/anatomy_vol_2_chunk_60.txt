Information flows through a neuron from the dendrites,
across the cell body, and down the axon. This gives the neuron a polarity—meaning that information flows in this one
direction. Figure 12.8 shows the relationship of these parts to one another.

Where the axon emerges from the cell body, there is a special region referred to as the axon hillock. This is a tapering
of the cell body toward the axon fiber. Within the axon hillock, the cytoplasm changes to a solution of limited components
called axoplasm. Because the axon hillock represents the beginning of the axon, it is also referred to as the initial segment.

 Many axons are wrapped by an insulating substance called myelin, which is actually made from glial cells.
