A common sign that labor will be short is the so-called “bloody show.” During pregnancy, a plug of mucus accumulates
in the cervical canal, blocking the entrance to the uterus. Approximately 1-2 days prior to the onset of true labor, this plug
loosens and is expelled, along with a small amount of blood.

 Meanwhile, the posterior pituitary has been boosting its secretion of oxytocin, a hormone that stimulates the
contractions of labor. At the same time, the myometrium increases its sensitivity to oxytocin by expressing more receptors
for this hormone. As labor nears, oxytocin begins to stimulate stronger, more painful uterine contractions, which—in a
positive feedback loop—stimulate the secretion of prostaglandins from fetal membranes. Like oxytocin, prostaglandins also
enhance uterine contractile strength. The fetal pituitary also secretes oxytocin, which increases prostaglandins even further.
 Given the importance of oxytocin and prostaglandins to the initiation and maintenance of labor, it is not surprising that,
when a pregnancy is not progressing to labor and needs to be induced, a pharmaceutical version of these compounds (called
pitocin) is administered by intravenous drip.
