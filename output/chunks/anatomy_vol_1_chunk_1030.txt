It is the arrival of Ca** in

the sarcoplasm that initiates contraction of the muscle fiber by its contractile units, or sarcomeres.

10.3 | Muscle Fiber Contraction and Relaxation

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 ¢ Describe the components involved in a muscle contraction
¢ Explain how muscles contract and relax
¢ Describe the sliding filament model of muscle contraction

The sequence of events that result in the contraction of an individual muscle fiber begins with a signal—the
neurotransmitter, ACh—from the motor neuron innervating that fiber. The local membrane of the fiber will depolarize

as positively charged sodium ions (Na*) enter, triggering an action potential that spreads to the rest of the membrane
