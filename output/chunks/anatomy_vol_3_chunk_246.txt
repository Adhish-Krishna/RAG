Moreover, intestinal juice combines with pancreatic juice to provide a liquid medium that facilitates absorption. The
intestine is also where most water is absorbed, via osmosis. The small intestineâ€™s absorptive cells also synthesize digestive
enzymes and then place them in the plasma membranes of the microvilli. This distinguishes the small intestine from the
stomach; that is, enzymatic digestion occurs not only in the lumen, but also on the luminal surfaces of the mucosal cells.

 For optimal chemical digestion, chyme must be delivered from the stomach slowly and in small amounts. This is
because chyme from the stomach is typically hypertonic, and if large quantities were forced all at once into the small
intestine, the resulting osmotic water loss from the blood into the intestinal lumen would result in potentially life-threatening
low blood volume.
