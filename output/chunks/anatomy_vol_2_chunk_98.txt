The
ions, in this case, are cations of sodium, calcium, and potassium.

 A mechanically gated channel opens because of a physical distortion of the cell membrane. Many channels associated
with the sense of touch (somatosensation) are mechanically gated. For example, as pressure is applied to the skin, these
channels open and allow ions to enter the cell. Similar to this type of channel would be the channel that opens on the basis
of temperature changes, as in testing the water in the shower (Figure 12.19).

pressure or touch, the channel is physically opened.
