A superficial reflex is
elicited through gentle stimulation of the skin and causes contraction of the associated muscles.
 For the arm, the common reflexes to test are of the biceps, brachioradialis, triceps, and flexors for the digits. For the leg,
the knee-jerk reflex of the quadriceps is common, as is the ankle reflex for the gastrocnemius and soleus. The tendon at the
insertion for each of these muscles is struck with a rubber mallet. The muscle is quickly stretched, resulting in activation of
the muscle spindle that sends a signal into the spinal cord through the dorsal root. The fiber synapses directly on the ventral
horn motor neuron that activates the muscle, causing contraction. The reflexes are physiologically useful for stability. If a
muscle is stretched, it reflexively contracts to return the muscle to compensate for the change in length. In the context of the
neurological exam, reflexes indicate that the LMN is functioning properly.
