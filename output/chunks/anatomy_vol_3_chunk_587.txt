Figure 26.7 Capillary Exchange Net filtration occurs near the arterial end of the capillary since capillary hydrostatic
pressure (CHP) is greater than blood colloidal osmotic pressure (BCOP). There is no net movement of fluid near the
midpoint of the capillary since CHP = BCOP. Net reabsorption occurs near the venous end of the capillary since BCOP
is greater than CHP.

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/dynamicfluid) to see an explanation of the dynamics of fluid in the
body’s compartments. What happens in the tissue when capillary blood pressure is less than osmotic pressure?

Hydrostatic pressure is especially important in governing the movement of water in the nephrons of the kidneys to
ensure proper filtering of the blood to form urine.
