CHAPTER 8 | THE APPENDICULAR SKELETON 291

The clavicle has three regions: the medial end, the lateral end, and the shaft. The medial end, known as the sternal
end of the clavicle, has a triangular shape and articulates with the manubrium portion of the sternum. This forms
the sternoclavicular joint, which is the only bony articulation between the pectoral girdle of the upper limb and the
axial skeleton. This joint allows considerable mobility, enabling the clavicle and scapula to move in upward/downward
and anterior/posterior directions during shoulder movements. The sternoclavicular joint is indirectly supported by the
costoclavicular ligament (costo- = “rib”), which spans the sternal end of the clavicle and the underlying first rib. The lateral
or acromial end of the clavicle articulates with the acromion of the scapula, the portion of the scapula that forms the bony
tip of the shoulder.
