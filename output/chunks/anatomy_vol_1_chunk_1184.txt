The pectoral girdle, or shoulder girdle, consists of the lateral ends of the clavicle and scapula, along with the proximal
end of the humerus, and the muscles covering these three bones to stabilize the shoulder joint. The girdle creates a base
from which the head of the humerus, in its ball-and-socket joint with the glenoid fossa of the scapula, can move the arm in
multiple directions.

 Muscles That Position the Pectoral Girdle

Muscles that position the pectoral girdle are located either on the anterior thorax or on the posterior thorax (Figure 11.22 and
Table 11.8). The anterior muscles include the subclavius, pectoralis minor, and serratus anterior. The posterior muscles
include the trapezius, rhomboid major, and rhomboid minor. When the rhomboids are contracted, your scapula moves
medially, which can pull the shoulder and upper limb posteriorly.
