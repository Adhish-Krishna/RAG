Figure 20.34 Systemic Arteries of the Lower Limb The flow chart summarizes the distribution of the systemic
arteries from the external iliac artery into the lower limb.

 Arteries Serving the Lower Limbs
Vessel Description

Continuation of the external iliac artery after it passes through the body cavity; divides into
Femoral artery | several smaller branches, the lateral deep femoral artery, and the genicular artery; becomes
the popliteal artery as it passes posterior to the knee

Deep femoral Branch of the femoral artery; gives rise to the lateral circumflex arteries

artery

Lateral . - .
circumflex Branch of the deep femoral artery; supplies blood to the deep muscles of the thigh and the
artery ventral and lateral regions of the integument

Genicular artery | Branch of the femoral artery; supplies blood to the region of the knee

Continuation of the femoral artery posterior to the knee; branches into the anterior and

Popliteal artery posterior tibial arteries

Anterior tibial Branches from the popliteal artery; supplies blood to the anterior tibial region; becomes the
artery dorsalis pedis artery

Arteries Serving the Lower Limbs

Vessel Description

Dorsalis pedis | Forms from the anterior tibial artery; branches repeatedly to supply blood to the tarsal and
artery dorsal regions of the foot

Posterior tibial | Branches from the popliteal artery and gives rise to the fibular or peroneal artery; supplies
artery blood to the posterior tibial region

Medial plantar | Arises from the bifurcation of the posterior tibial arteries; supplies blood to the medial plantar
artery surfaces of the foot

Lateral plantar |
