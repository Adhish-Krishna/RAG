A very small amount of CSF is filtered at any
one of the plexuses, for a total of about 500 milliliters daily, but it is continuously made and pulses through the ventricular
system, keeping the fluid moving. From the fourth ventricle, CSF can continue down the central canal of the spinal cord,
but this is essentially a cul-de-sac, so more of the fluid leaves the ventricular system and moves into the subarachnoid space
through the median and lateral apertures.
 Within the subarachnoid space, the CSF flows around all of the CNS, providing two important functions. As with
elsewhere in its circulation, the CSF picks up metabolic wastes from the nervous tissue and moves it out of the CNS. It also
acts as a liquid cushion for the brain and spinal cord. By surrounding the entire system in the subarachnoid space, it provides
