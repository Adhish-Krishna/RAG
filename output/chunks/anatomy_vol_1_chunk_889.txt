Due to the immobility of a gomphosis,
this type of joint is functionally classified as a synarthrosis.

 9.3 | Cartilaginous Joints

 By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the structural features of cartilaginous joints
¢ Distinguish between a synchondrosis and symphysis
* Give an example of each type of cartilaginous joint

As the name indicates, at a cartilaginous joint, the adjacent bones are united by cartilage, a tough but flexible type of
connective tissue. These types of joints lack a joint cavity and involve bones that are joined together by either hyaline
cartilage or fibrocartilage (Figure 9.7). There are two types of cartilaginous joints. A synchondrosis is a cartilaginous joint
where the bones are joined by hyaline cartilage. Also classified as a synchondrosis are places where bone is united to a
cartilage structure, such as between the anterior end of a rib and the costal cartilage of the thoracic cage.
