however, because when the intestine distends with chyme, the enterogastric reflex inhibits secretion. One of the effects of
this reflex is to close the pyloric sphincter, which blocks additional chyme from entering the duodenum.

 The Mucosal Barrier

The mucosa of the stomach is exposed to the highly corrosive acidity of gastric juice. Gastric enzymes that can digest
protein can also digest the stomach itself. The stomach is protected from self-digestion by the mucosal barrier. This barrier
has several components. First, the stomach wall is covered by a thick coating of bicarbonate-rich mucus. This mucus forms
a physical barrier, and its bicarbonate ions neutralize acid. Second, the epithelial cells of the stomach's mucosa meet at tight
junctions, which block gastric juice from penetrating the underlying tissue layers.
