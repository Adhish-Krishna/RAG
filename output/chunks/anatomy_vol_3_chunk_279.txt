This muscular sac stores, concentrates, and, when stimulated, propels the bile into the duodenum via the common
bile duct. It is divided into three regions. The fundus is the widest portion and tapers medially into the body, which in turn
narrows to become the neck. The neck angles slightly superiorly as it approaches the hepatic duct. The cystic duct is 1-2
cm (less than 1 in) long and turns inferiorly as it bridges the neck and hepatic duct.

 The simple columnar epithelium of the gallbladder mucosa is organized in rugae, similar to those of the stomach.
 There is no submucosa in the gallbladder wall. The wall’s middle, muscular coat is made of smooth muscle fibers. When
these fibers contract, the gallbladder’s contents are ejected through the cystic duct and into the bile duct (Figure 23.27).
 Visceral peritoneum reflected from the liver capsule holds the gallbladder against the liver and forms the outer coat of the
gallbladder.
