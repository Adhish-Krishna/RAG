Normal hematocrit values for females range from 37 to 47,
with a mean value of 41; for males, hematocrit ranges from 42 to 52, with a mean of 47. The percentage of other formed
elements, the WBCs and platelets, is extremely small so it is not normally considered with the hematocrit. So the mean
plasma percentage is the percent of blood that is not erythrocytes: for females, it is approximately 59 (or 100 minus 41), and
for males, it is approximately 53 (or 100 minus 47).
