Each lateral wall of the nasal cavity has three
bony projections, called the superior, middle, and inferior nasal conchae. The inferior conchae are separate bones, whereas
the superior and middle conchae are portions of the ethmoid bone. Conchae serve to increase the surface area of the nasal
cavity and to disrupt the flow of air as it enters the nose, causing air to bounce along the epithelium, where it is cleaned and
warmed. The conchae and meatuses also conserve water and prevent dehydration of the nasal epithelium by trapping water
during exhalation. The floor of the nasal cavity is composed of the palate. The hard palate at the anterior region of the nasal
cavity is composed of bone. The soft palate at the posterior portion of the nasal cavity consists of muscle tissue. Air exits
the nasal cavities via the internal nares and moves into the pharynx.
