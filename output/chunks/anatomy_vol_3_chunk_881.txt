In the formation of gametes, it is equally likely that either one of a pair alleles
from one parent will be passed on to the offspring. This figure follows the possible combinations of alleles through
two generations following a first-generation cross of homozygous dominant and homozygous recessive parents. The
recessive phenotype, which is masked in the second generation, has a 1 in 4, or 25 percent, chance of reappearing in
the third generation.

 Mendelâ€™s observation of pea plants also included many crosses that involved multiple traits, which prompted him to
formulate the principle of independent assortment. The law states that the members of one pair of genes (alleles) from a
parent will sort independently from other pairs of genes during the formation of gametes. Applied to pea plants, that means
that the alleles associated with the different traits of the plant, such as color, height, or seed type, will sort independently
of one another.
