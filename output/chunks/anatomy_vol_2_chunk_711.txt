This, in turn, signals the pituitary gland to release more
oxytocin, causing labor contractions to intensify. The release of oxytocin decreases after the birth of the child.

 The more common method of hormone regulation is the negative feedback loop. Negative feedback is characterized by
the inhibition of further secretion of a hormone in response to adequate levels of that hormone. This allows blood levels of
the hormone to be regulated within a narrow range. An example of a negative feedback loop is the release of glucocorticoid
hormones from the adrenal glands, as directed by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. As glucocorticoid concentrations
in the blood rise, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland reduce their signaling to the adrenal glands to prevent additional
glucocorticoid secretion (Figure 17.6).
