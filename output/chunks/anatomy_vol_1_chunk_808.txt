This broad area is occupied by portions of the small and large intestines, and because it is more closely associated with the
abdominal cavity, it is sometimes referred to as the false pelvis. More inferiorly, the narrow, rounded space of the lesser
pelvis (lesser pelvic cavity; true pelvis) contains the bladder and other pelvic organs, and thus is also known as the true
pelvis. The pelvic brim (also known as the pelvic inlet) forms the superior margin of the lesser pelvis, separating it from
the greater pelvis. The pelvic brim is defined by a line formed by the upper margin of the pubic symphysis anteriorly, and
the pectineal line of the pubis, the arcuate line of the ilium, and the sacral promontory (the anterior margin of the superior
sacrum) posteriorly.
