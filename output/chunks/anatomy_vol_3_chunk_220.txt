The acidity also kills much of the bacteria you ingest with food and helps to denature
proteins, making them more available for enzymatic digestion. Intrinsic factor is a glycoprotein necessary for the absorption
of vitamin B12 in the small intestine.

 Chief cells—Located primarily in the basal regions of gastric glands are chief cells, which secrete pepsinogen, the
inactive proenzyme form of pepsin. HCl is necessary for the conversion of pepsinogen to pepsin.

 Mucous neck cells—Gastric glands in the upper part of the stomach contain mucous neck cells that secrete thin, acidic
mucus that is much different from the mucus secreted by the goblet cells of the surface epithelium. The role of this mucus
is not currently known.

 Enteroendocrine cells—Finally, enteroendocrine cells found in the gastric glands secrete various hormones into the
interstitial fluid of the lamina propria. These include gastrin, which is released mainly by enteroendocrine G cells.

 Table 23.6 describes the digestive functions of important hormones secreted by the stomach.
