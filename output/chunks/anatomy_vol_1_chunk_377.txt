Briefly explain the similarities between transcription

39. What would happen if anaphase proceeded even though
the sister chromatids were not properly attached to their
respective microtubules and lined up at the metaphase plate?

40. What are cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases, and how
do they interact?

41. Explain how a transcription factor ultimately determines
whether or not a protein will be present in a given cell?

42. Discuss two reasons why the therapeutic use of
