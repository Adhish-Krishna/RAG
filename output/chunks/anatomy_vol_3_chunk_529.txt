25.8 | Endocrine Regulation of Kidney Function

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe how each of the following functions in the extrinsic control of GFR: renin-angiotensin mechanism,
natriuretic peptides, and sympathetic adrenergic activity
* Describe how each of the following works to regulate reabsorption and secretion, so as to affect urine volume and
composition: renin—angiotensin system, aldosterone, antidiuretic hormone, and natriuretic peptides

¢ Name and define the roles of other hormones that regulate kidney control

Several hormones have specific, important roles in regulating kidney function.
