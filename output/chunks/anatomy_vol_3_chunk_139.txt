A small portion of carbon dioxide remains. The largest amount of transported carbon dioxide
is as bicarbonate, formed in erythrocytes. For this conversion, carbon dioxide is combined with water with the aid of an
enzyme called carbonic anhydrase. This combination forms carbonic acid, which spontaneously dissociates into bicarbonate
and hydrogen ions. As bicarbonate builds up in erythrocytes, it is moved across the membrane into the plasma in exchange
for chloride ions by a mechanism called the chloride shift. At the pulmonary capillaries, bicarbonate re-enters erythrocytes
in exchange for chloride ions, and the reaction with carbonic anhydrase is reversed, recreating carbon dioxide and water.
 Carbon dioxide then diffuses out of the erythrocyte and across the respiratory membrane into the air. An intermediate
amount of carbon dioxide binds directly to hemoglobin to form carbaminohemoglobin. The partial pressures of carbon
dioxide and oxygen, as well as the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, influence how readily hemoglobin binds carbon
dioxide.
