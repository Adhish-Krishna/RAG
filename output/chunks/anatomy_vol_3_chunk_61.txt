Instead, the
elasticity of the lung tissue causes the lung to recoil, as the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax following inspiration. In
turn, the thoracic cavity and lungs decrease in volume, causing an increase in interpulmonary pressure. The interpulmonary
pressure rises above atmospheric pressure, creating a pressure gradient that causes air to leave the lungs.

 There are different types, or modes, of breathing that require a slightly different process to allow inspiration and
expiration. Quiet breathing, also known as eupnea, is a mode of breathing that occurs at rest and does not require the
cognitive thought of the individual. During quiet breathing, the diaphragm and external intercostals must contract.

 A deep breath, called diaphragmatic breathing, requires the diaphragm to contract. As the diaphragm relaxes, air
passively leaves the lungs. A shallow breath, called costal breathing, requires contraction of the intercostal muscles. As the
intercostal muscles relax, air passively leaves the lungs.
