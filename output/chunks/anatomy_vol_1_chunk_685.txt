This irregular space may be divided at the midline into bilateral spaces,
or these may be fused into a single sinus space. The frontal sinus is the most anterior of the paranasal sinuses. The largest
sinus is the maxillary sinus. These are paired and located within the right and left maxillary bones, where they occupy
the area just below the orbits. The maxillary sinuses are most commonly involved during sinus infections. Because their
connection to the nasal cavity is located high on their medial wall, they are difficult to drain. The sphenoid sinus is a single,
midline sinus. It is located within the body of the sphenoid bone, just anterior and inferior to the sella turcica, thus making it
the most posterior of the paranasal sinuses. The lateral aspects of the ethmoid bone contain multiple small spaces separated

by very thin bony walls. Each of these spaces is called an ethmoid air cell. These are located on both sides of the ethmoid
bone, between the upper nasal cavity and medial orbit, just behind the superior nasal conchae.
