In contrast, adult stem cells isolated from a patient are not seen as foreign by the body, but they have a limited
range of differentiation. Some individuals bank the cord blood or deciduous teeth of their child, storing away those
sources of stem cells for future use, should their child need it. Induced pluripotent stem cells are considered a promising
advance in the field because using them avoids the legal, ethical, and immunological pitfalls of embryonic stem cells.

CHAPTER 3 | THE CELLULAR LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION

KEY TERMS
active transport form of transport across the cell membrane that requires input of cellular energy

amphipathic describes a molecule that exhibits a difference in polarity between its two ends, resulting in a difference in
water solubility

anaphase third stage of mitosis (and meiosis), during which sister chromatids separate into two new nuclear regions of
a dividing cell

anticodon consecutive sequence of three nucleotides on atRNA molecule that is complementary to a specific codon on
an mRNA molecule

autolysis breakdown of cells by their own enzymatic action
autophagy lysosomal breakdown of a cell’s own components
cell cycle life cycle of a single cell, from its birth until its division into two new daughter cells

cell membrane membrane surrounding all animal cells, composed of a lipid bilayer interspersed with various
molecules; also known as plasma membrane

centriole small, self-replicating organelle that provides the origin for microtubule growth and moves DNA during cell
division

centromere region of attachment for two sister chromatids
centrosome cellular structure that organizes microtubules during cell division

channel protein membrane-spanning protein that has an inner pore which allows the passage of one or more
substances

checkpoint progress point in the cell cycle during which certain conditions must be met in order for the cell to proceed
to a subsequence phase

chromatin substance consisting of DNA and associated proteins
chromosome condensed version of chromatin

cilia small appendage on certain cells formed by microtubules and modified for movement of materials across the
cellular surface

cleavage furrow contractile ring that forms around a cell during cytokinesis that pinches the cell into two halves
codon consecutive sequence of three nucleotides on an MRNA molecule that corresponds to a specific amino acid
concentration gradient difference in the concentration of a substance between two regions

cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) one of a group of enzymes associated with cyclins that help them perform their
functions

cyclin one of a group of proteins that function in the progression of the cell cycle
cytokinesis final stage in cell division, where the cytoplasm divides to form two separate daughter cells

cytoplasm internal material between the cell membrane and nucleus of a cell, mainly consisting of a water-based fluid
called cytosol, within which are all the other organelles and cellular solute and suspended materials

cytoskeleton “skeleton” of a cell; formed by rod-like proteins that support the cell’s shape and provide, among other
functions, locomotive abilities

cytosol clear, semi-fluid medium of the cytoplasm, made up mostly of water

DNA polymerase enzyme that functions in adding new nucleotides to a growing strand of DNA during DNA
replication

124 CHAPTER 3| THE CELLULAR LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION

DNA replication process of duplicating a molecule of DNA
diffusion movement of a substance from an area of higher concentration to one of lower concentration

diploid condition marked by the presence of a double complement of genetic material (two sets of chromosomes, one
set inherited from each of two parents)

electrical gradient difference in the electrical charge (potential) between two regions
endocytosis import of material into the cell by formation of a membrane-bound vesicle

endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cellular organelle that consists of interconnected membrane-bound tubules, which may
or may not be associated with ribosomes (rough type or smooth type, respectively)

exocytosis export of a substance out of a cell by formation of a membrane-bound vesicle
exon one of the coding regions of an mRNA molecule that remain after splicing

extracellular fluid (ECF) fluid exterior to cells; includes the interstitial fluid, blood plasma, and fluid found in other
reservoirs in the body

facilitated diffusion diffusion of a substance with the aid of a membrane protein
flagellum appendage on certain cells formed by microtubules and modified for movement

Go phase phase of the cell cycle, usually entered from the G1 phase; characterized by long or permanent periods where
the cell does not move forward into the DNA synthesis phase
