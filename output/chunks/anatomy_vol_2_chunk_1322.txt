Along the way, the lymph travels through the lymph nodes, which are
commonly found near the groin, armpits, neck, chest, and abdomen. Humans have about 500-600 lymph nodes throughout
the body (Figure 21.2).

Figure 21.2 Anatomy of the Lymphatic System Lymphatic vessels in the arms and legs convey lymph to the larger
lymphatic vessels in the torso.

 A major distinction between the lymphatic and cardiovascular systems in humans is that lymph is not actively pumped
by the heart, but is forced through the vessels by the movements of the body, the contraction of skeletal muscles during
body movements, and breathing.
