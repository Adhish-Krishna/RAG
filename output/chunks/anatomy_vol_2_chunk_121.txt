A stimulus starts the depolarization, but the action potential runs on its own once a threshold has been reached.
 The question is now, “What flips the light switch on?” Temporary changes to the cell membrane voltage can result from
neurons receiving information from the environment, or from the action of one neuron on another. These special types of
potentials influence a neuron and determine whether an action potential will occur or not. Many of these transient signals
originate at the synapse.

 Graded Potentials

Local changes in the membrane potential are called graded potentials and are usually associated with the dendrites of
a neuron. The amount of change in the membrane potential is determined by the size of the stimulus that causes it.
 In the example of testing the temperature of the shower, slightly warm water would only initiate a small change in a
thermoreceptor, whereas hot water would cause a large amount of change in the membrane potential.
