It can compare this with sensory feedback input through the medulla and send output
through the midbrain that can correct motor commands for coordination.

 13.3 Circulation and the Central Nervous System

The CNS has a privileged blood supply established by the blood-brain barrier. Establishing this barrier are anatomical
structures that help to protect and isolate the CNS. The arterial blood to the brain comes from the internal carotid and
vertebral arteries, which both contribute to the unique circle of Willis that provides constant perfusion of the brain even
if one of the blood vessels is blocked or narrowed. That blood is eventually filtered to make a separate medium, the CSF,
that circulates within the spaces of the brain and then into the surrounding space defined by the meninges, the protective
covering of the brain and spinal cord.
