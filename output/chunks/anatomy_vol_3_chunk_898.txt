When a
woman over 35 is pregnant or intends to become pregnant, or her partner is over 55, or if there is a family history of a
genetic disorder, she and her partner may want to speak to a genetic counselor to discuss the likelihood that their child
may be affected by a genetic or chromosomal disorder. A genetic counselor can interpret a coupleâ€™s family history and
estimate the risks to their future offspring.

 For many genetic diseases, a DNA test can determine whether a person is a carrier. For instance, carrier status
for Fragile X, an X-linked disorder associated with mental retardation, or for cystic fibrosis can be determined with
a simple blood draw to obtain DNA for testing. A genetic counselor can educate a couple about the implications of
such a test and help them decide whether to undergo testing. For chromosomal disorders, the available testing options
include a blood test, amniocentesis (in which amniotic fluid is tested), and chorionic villus sampling (in which tissue
from the placenta is tested).
