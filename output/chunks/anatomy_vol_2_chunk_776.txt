Although it is primarily an exocrine gland, secreting a variety of digestive enzymes, the pancreas has an endocrine function.
 Its pancreatic islets—clusters of cells formerly known as the islets of Langerhans—secrete the hormones glucagon, insulin,
somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide (PP).

Figure 17.18 Pancreas The pancreatic exocrine function involves the acinar cells secreting digestive enzymes that
are transported into the small intestine by the pancreatic duct. Its endocrine function involves the secretion of insulin
(produced by beta cells) and glucagon (produced by alpha cells) within the pancreatic islets. These two hormones
regulate the rate of glucose metabolism in the body. The micrograph reveals pancreatic islets. LM x 760. (Micrograph
