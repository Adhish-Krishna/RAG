Other effects include a dry mouth, loss of appetite, pupil dilation, and a loss of
peripheral vision. The major hormones of the adrenal glands are summarized in Table 17.5.

 Hormones of the Adrenal Glands

Adrenal gland Associated hormones Chemical class Effect

Adrenal cortex | Cortisol, corticosterone, cortisone | Steroid Increase blood glucose levels
Adrenal medulla Epinephrine, norepinephrine Amine Stimulate fight-or-flight response

Disorders Involving the Adrenal Glands

Several disorders are caused by the dysregulation of the hormones produced by the adrenal glands. For example, Cushing’s
disease is a disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels and the accumulation of lipid deposits on the face and neck.
 It is caused by hypersecretion of cortisol. The most common source of Cushing’s disease is a pituitary tumor that secretes
