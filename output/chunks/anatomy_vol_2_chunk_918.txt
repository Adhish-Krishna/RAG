Problems are rare in a first

pregnancy, since the baby’s Rh” cells rarely cross the placenta (the organ of gas and nutrient exchange between the baby

and the mother). However, during or immediately after birth, the Rh mother can be
(Figure 18.15). Research has shown that this occurs in about 13-14 percent of such

exposed to the baby’s Rh” cells
pregnancies. After exposure, the

mother’s immune system begins to generate anti-Rh antibodies. If the mother should then conceive another Rh” baby, the
Rh antibodies she has produced can cross the placenta into the fetal bloodstream and destroy the fetal RBCs. This condition,
known as hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) or erythroblastosis fetalis, may cause anemia in mild cases, but the

agglutination and hemolysis can be so severe that without treatment the fetus may die in t
