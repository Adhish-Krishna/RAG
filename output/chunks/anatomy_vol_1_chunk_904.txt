The bone rotates within this ring. Since the rotation is around a single axis,
pivot joints are functionally classified as a uniaxial diarthrosis type of joint. An example of a pivot joint is the atlantoaxial
joint, found between the C1 (atlas) and C2 (axis) vertebrae. Here, the upward projecting dens of the axis articulates with the
inner aspect of the atlas, where it is held in place by a ligament. Rotation at this joint allows you to turn your head from side
to side. A second pivot joint is found at the proximal radioulnar joint. Here, the head of the radius is largely encircled by
