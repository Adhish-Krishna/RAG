These then fuse into a single heart tube and differentiate into the truncus arteriosus, bulbus
cordis, primitive ventricle, primitive atrium, and sinus venosus, starting about day 22. The primitive heart begins to form an
S shape within the pericardium between days 23 and 28. The internal septa begin to form about day 28, separating the heart
into the atria and ventricles, although the foramen ovale persists until shortly after birth. Between weeks five and eight, the
atrioventricular valves form. The semilunar valves form between weeks five and nine.

INTERACTIVE LINK QUESTIONS

1. Visit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/heartvalve)
to observe an echocardiogram of actual heart valves opening
and closing. Although much of the heart has been “removed”
from this gif loop so the chordae tendineae are not visible,
