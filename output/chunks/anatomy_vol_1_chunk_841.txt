During the seventh week of development, the upper limb rotates laterally by 90 degrees, so
that the palm of the hand faces anteriorly and the thumb points laterally. In contrast, the lower limb undergoes a 90-degree
medial rotation, thus bringing the big toe to the medial side of the foot.

Watch this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/limbbuds) to follow the development and growth of the upper
and lower limb buds. On what days of embryonic development do these events occur: (a) first appearance of the upper
limb bud (limb ridge); (b) the flattening of the distal limb to form the handplate or footplate; and (c) the beginning of
limb rotation?

 Ossification of Appendicular Bones

All of the girdle and limb bones, except for the clavicle, develop by the process of endochondral ossification. This process
begins as the mesenchyme within the limb bud differentiates into hyaline cartilage to form cartilage models for future
bones.
