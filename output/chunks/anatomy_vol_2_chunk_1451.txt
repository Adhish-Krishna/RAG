Unfortunately, many cancers mutate, so they no longer express any specific
antigens for the immune system to respond to, and a subpopulation of cancer cells escapes the immune response, continuing
the disease process.

 This fact has led to extensive research in trying to develop ways to enhance the early immune response to completely
eliminate the early cancer and thus prevent a later escape. One method that has shown some success is the use of cancer
vaccines, which differ from viral and bacterial vaccines in that they are directed against the cells of oneâ€™s own body.
 Treated cancer cells are injected into cancer patients to enhance their anti-cancer immune response and thereby prolong
survival. The immune system has the capability to detect these cancer cells and proliferate faster than the cancer cells
do, overwhelming the cancer in a similar way as they do for viruses. Cancer vaccines have been developed for malignant
melanoma, a highly fatal skin cancer, and renal (kidney) cell carcinoma.
