As noted earlier, the polar body that results from unequal cell division simply degrades. The LH surge also triggers
proteases (enzymes that cleave proteins) to break down structural proteins in the ovary wall on the surface of the bulging
dominant follicle. This degradation of the wall, combined with pressure from the large, fluid-filled antrum, results in the
expulsion of the oocyte surrounded by granulosa cells into the peritoneal cavity. This release is ovulation.

 In the next section, you will follow the ovulated oocyte as it travels toward the uterus, but there is one more important
event that occurs in the ovarian cycle. The surge of LH also stimulates a change in the granulosa and theca cells that remain
in the follicle after the oocyte has been ovulated. This change is called luteinization (recall that the full name of LH is

luteinizing hormone), and it transforms the collapsed follicle into a new endocrine structure called the corpus luteum, a
term meaning “yellowish body” (see Figure 27.12).
