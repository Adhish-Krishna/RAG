The bones that form the base and facial regions of the skull develop through the process of endochondral ossification.
 In this process, mesenchyme accumulates and differentiates into hyaline cartilage, which forms a model of the future bone.
 The hyaline cartilage model is then gradually, over a period of many years, displaced by bone. The mesenchyme between
these developing bones becomes the fibrous connective tissue of the suture joints between the bones in these regions of the
skull.
 A similar process of endochondral ossification gives rises to the bones and joints of the limbs. The limbs initially
develop as small limb buds that appear on the sides of the embryo around the end of the fourth week of development.
 Starting during the sixth week, as each limb bud continues to grow and elongate, areas of mesenchyme within the bud
begin to differentiate into the hyaline cartilage that will form models for of each of the future bones.
