Within the structure of the papillae are taste buds that contain specialized gustatory receptor
cells for the transduction of taste stimuli. These receptor cells are sensitive to the chemicals contained within foods that are
ingested, and they release neurotransmitters based on the amount of the chemical in the food. Neurotransmitters from the
gustatory cells can activate sensory neurons in the facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus cranial nerves.

Figure 14.3 The Tongue The tongue is covered with small bumps, called papillae, which contain taste buds that are
sensitive to chemicals in ingested food or drink. Different types of papillae are found in different regions of the tongue.
 The taste buds contain specialized gustatory receptor cells that respond to chemical stimuli dissolved in the saliva.
 These receptor cells activate sensory neurons that are part of the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves. LM x 1600.
