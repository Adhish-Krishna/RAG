Hydrostatic (fluid) pressure is sufficient to push
water through the membrane despite the osmotic pressure working against it. The sum of all of the influences, both osmotic
and hydrostatic, results in a net filtration pressure (NFP) of about 10 mm Hg (Figure 25.16).

Figure 25.16 Net Filtration Pressure The NFP is the sum of osmotic and hydrostatic pressures.

 A proper concentration of solutes in the blood is important in maintaining osmotic pressure both in the glomerulus and
systemically. There are disorders in which too much protein passes through the filtration slits into the kidney filtrate. This
excess protein in the filtrate leads to a deficiency of circulating plasma proteins. In turn, the presence of protein in the urine
increases its osmolarity; this holds more water in the filtrate and results in an increase in urine volume.
