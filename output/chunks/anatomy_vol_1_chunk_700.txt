The intervertebral foramen is the
opening formed between adjacent vertebrae for the exit of a spinal nerve.

 Regional Modifications of Vertebrae

In addition to the general characteristics of a typical vertebra described above, vertebrae also display characteristic size
and structural features that vary between the different vertebral column regions. Thus, cervical vertebrae are smaller than
lumbar vertebrae due to differences in the proportion of body weight that each supports. Thoracic vertebrae have sites for
rib attachment, and the vertebrae that give rise to the sacrum and coccyx have fused together into single bones.

 Cervical Vertebrae

Typical cervical vertebrae, such as C4 or C5, have several characteristic features that differentiate them from thoracic or
lumbar vertebrae (Figure 7.25). Cervical vertebrae have a small body, reflecting the fact that they carry the least amount
of body weight. Cervical vertebrae usually have a bifid (Y-shaped) spinous process. The spinous processes of the C3-C6
vertebrae are short, but the spine of C7 is much longer.
