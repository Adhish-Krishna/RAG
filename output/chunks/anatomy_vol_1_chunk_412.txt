Connective tissue proper includes loose connective tissue
and dense connective tissue. Both tissues have a variety of cell types and protein fibers suspended in a viscous ground
substance. Dense connective tissue is reinforced by bundles of fibers that provide tensile strength, elasticity, and protection.
 In loose connective tissue, the fibers are loosely organized, leaving large spaces in between. Supportive connective
tissue—bone and cartilage—provide structure and strength to the body and protect soft tissues. A few distinct cell types and
densely packed fibers in a matrix characterize these tissues. In bone, the matrix is rigid and described as calcified because of
the deposited calcium salts. In fluid connective tissue, in other words, lymph and blood, various specialized cells circulate
in a watery fluid containing salts, nutrients, and dissolved proteins.
