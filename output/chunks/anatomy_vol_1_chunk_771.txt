On the posterior aspect, the spine of the scapula is a long and prominent ridge that runs across its upper
portion. Extending laterally from the spine is a flattened and expanded region called the acromion or acromial process.
 The acromion forms the bony tip of the superior shoulder region and articulates with the lateral end of the clavicle, forming
the acromioclavicular joint (see Figure 8.3). Together, the clavicle, acromion, and spine of the scapula form a V-shaped
bony line that provides for the attachment of neck and back muscles that act on the shoulder, as well as muscles that pass
across the shoulder joint to act on the arm.

 The scapula has three depressions, each of which is called a fossa (plural = fossae). Two of these are found on the
posterior scapula, above and below the scapular spine. Superior to the spine is the narrow supraspinous fossa, and inferior
to the spine is the broad infraspinous fossa.
