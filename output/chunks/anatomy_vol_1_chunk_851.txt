The
medial side of the distal humerus has the large, medial epicondyle. The articulating surfaces of the distal humerus consist of
the trochlea medially and the capitulum laterally. Depressions on the humerus that accommodate the forearm bones during
bending (flexing) and straightening (extending) of the elbow include the coronoid fossa, the radial fossa, and the olecranon
fossa.
 The forearm is the region of the upper limb located between the elbow and wrist joints. This region contains two bones,
the ulna medially and the radius on the lateral (thumb) side. The elbow joint is formed by the articulation between the
trochlea of the humerus and the trochlear notch of the ulna, plus the articulation between the capitulum of the humerus and
the head of the radius. The proximal radioulnar joint is the articulation between the head of the radius and the radial notch of
the ulna. The proximal ulna also has the olecranon process, forming an expanded posterior region, and the coronoid process
and ulnar tuberosity on its anterior aspect.
