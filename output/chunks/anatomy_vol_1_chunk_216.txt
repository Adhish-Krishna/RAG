For this reason, they make excellent buffers, helping the body regulate acid-base balance. What distinguishes
the 20 amino acids from one another is their variable group, which is referred to as a side chain or an R-group. This group
can vary in size and can be polar or nonpolar, giving each amino acid its unique characteristics. For example, the side
chains of two amino acids—cysteine and methionine—contain sulfur. Sulfur does not readily participate in hydrogen bonds,
whereas all other amino acids do. This variation influences the way that proteins containing cysteine and methionine are
assembled.

 Amino acids join via dehydration synthesis to form protein polymers (Figure 2.25). The unique bond holding amino
acids together is called a peptide bond. A peptide bond is a covalent bond between two amino acids that forms by
