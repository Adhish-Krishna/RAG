39. Case Study: Bob is a 64-year-old male admitted to
the emergency room for asthma. His laboratory results are
as follows: pH 7.31, pCOz2 higher than normal, and total

HCO3° also higher than normal. Classify his acid-base
balance as acidosis or alkalosis, and as metabolic or
respiratory. Is there evidence of compensation? Propose the
mechanism by which asthma contributed to the lab results
seen.

40. Case Study: Kim is a 38-year-old women admitted to the
hospital for bulimia. Her laboratory results are as follows:

 pH 7.48, pCOz in the normal range, and total HCO3_ higher
than normal. Classify her acid-base balance as acidosis or
alkalosis, and as metabolic or respiratory.
