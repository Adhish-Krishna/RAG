Acid—base balance is maintained through actions of the lungs and kidneys: The lungs rid the body

of H”, whereas the kidneys secrete or reabsorb H” and HCO3_ (Table 25.6). In the case of urea, about 50 percent is
passively reabsorbed by the PCT. More is recovered by in the collecting ducts as needed. ADH induces the insertion of urea
transporters and aquaporin channel proteins.

Reabsorption and Secretion in the PCT

The renal corpuscle filters the blood to create a filtrate that differs from blood mainly in the absence of cells and large
proteins.
