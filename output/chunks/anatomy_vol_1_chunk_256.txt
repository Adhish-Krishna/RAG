Explain the major features and properties of the cell membrane
¢ Differentiate between materials that can and cannot diffuse through the lipid bilayer
* Compare and contrast different types of passive transport with active transport, providing examples of each

Despite differences in structure and function, all living cells in multicellular organisms have a surrounding cell membrane.
 As the outer layer of your skin separates your body from its environment, the cell membrane (also known as the plasma
membrane) separates the inner contents of a cell from its exterior environment. This cell membrane provides a protective
barrier around the cell and regulates which materials can pass in or out.

 Structure and Composition of the Cell Membrane

 [he cell membrane is an extremely pliable structure composed primarily of back-to-back phospholipids (a “bilayer”).
 Cholesterol is also present, which contributes to the fluidity of the membrane, and there are various proteins embedded
within the membrane that have a variety of functions.
