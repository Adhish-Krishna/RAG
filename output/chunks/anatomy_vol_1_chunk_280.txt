Iron,
a required component of hemoglobin, is endocytosed by red blood cells in this way. Iron is bound to a protein called
transferrin in the blood. Specific transferrin receptors on red blood cell surfaces bind the iron-transferrin molecules, and the
cell endocytoses the receptor-ligand complexes.

 In contrast with endocytosis, exocytosis (taking “out of the cell”) is the process of a cell exporting material using
vesicular transport (Figure 3.11). Many cells manufacture substances that must be secreted, like a factory manufacturing a
product for export. These substances are typically packaged into membrane-bound vesicles within the cell. When the vesicle
membrane fuses with the cell membrane, the vesicle releases it contents into the interstitial fluid. The vesicle membrane
