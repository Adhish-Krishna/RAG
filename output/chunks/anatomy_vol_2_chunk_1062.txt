However, if any of these symptoms are present, they may indicate that the heart is not providing sufficient oxygenated
blood to the tissues. The term relative bradycardia may be used with a patient who has a HR in the normal range but is
still suffering from these symptoms. Most patients remain asymptomatic as long as the HR remains above 50 bpm.

 Bradycardia may be caused by either inherent factors or causes external to the heart. While the condition may
be inherited, typically it is acquired in older individuals. Inherent causes include abnormalities in either the SA or AV
node. If the condition is serious, a pacemaker may be required. Other causes include ischemia to the heart muscle
or diseases of the heart vessels or valves. External causes include metabolic disorders, pathologies of the endocrine
system often involving the thyroid, electrolyte imbalances, neurological disorders including inappropriate autonomic
responses, autoimmune pathologies, over-prescription of beta blocker drugs that reduce HR, recreational drug use, or
even prolonged bed rest.
