Both vasoconstriction and vasodilation are regulated in part by small vascular nerves, known as nervi
vasorum, or “nerves of the vessel,” that run within the walls of blood vessels. These are generally all sympathetic fibers,
although some trigger vasodilation and others induce vasoconstriction, depending upon the nature of the neurotransmitter
and receptors located on the target cell. Parasympathetic stimulation does trigger vasodilation as well as erection during
sexual arousal in the external genitalia of both sexes. Nervous control over vessels tends to be more generalized than the
specific targeting of individual blood vessels. Local controls, discussed later, account for this phenomenon. (Seek additional
content for more information on these dynamic aspects of the autonomic nervous system.) Hormones and local chemicals
also control blood vessels. Together, these neural and chemical mechanisms reduce or increase blood flow in response to
changing body conditions, from exercise to hydration. Regulation of both blood flow and blood pressure is discussed in
detail later in this chapter.
