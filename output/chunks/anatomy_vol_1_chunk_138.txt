Some liver tumors, however, are difficult to access surgically, and others could require the surgeon to remove
too much of the liver. Moreover, chemotherapy is highly toxic to the liver, and certain tumors do not respond well to it
anyway. In some such cases, an interventional radiologist can treat the tumors by disrupting their blood supply, which
they need if they are to continue to grow. In this procedure, called radioembolization, the radiologist accesses the liver
with a fine needle, threaded through one of the patient’s blood vessels. The radiologist then inserts tiny radioactive
“seeds” into the blood vessels that supply the tumors. In the days and weeks following the procedure, the radiation
emitted from the seeds destroys the vessels and directly kills the tumor cells in the vicinity of the treatment.

 Radioisotopes emit subatomic particles that can be detected and tracked by imaging technologies. One of the
most advanced uses of radioisotopes in medicine is the positron emission tomography (PET) scanner, which detects
the activity in the body of a very small injection of radioactive glucose, the simple sugar that cells use for energy.
