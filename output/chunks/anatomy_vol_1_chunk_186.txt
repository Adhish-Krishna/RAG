Acids

An acid is a substance that releases hydrogen ions (H") in solution (Figure 2.16a). Because an atom of hydrogen has just
one proton and one electron, a positively charged hydrogen ion is simply a proton. This solitary proton is highly likely to

participate in chemical reactions. Strong acids are compounds that release all of their H” in solution; that is, they ionize
completely. Hydrochloric acid (HCI), which is released from cells in the lining of the stomach, is a strong acid because it

releases all of its H* in the stomach’s watery environment. This strong acid aids in digestion and kills ingested microbes.

 Weak acids do not ionize completely; that is, some of their hydrogen ions remain bonded within a compound in solution.
 An example of a weak acid is vinegar, or acetic acid; it is called acetate after it gives up a proton.
