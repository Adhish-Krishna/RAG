With the exception of somatosensation, this list represents the special senses,
or those systems of the body that are associated with specific organs such as the tongue or eye. Somatosensation belongs to
the general senses, which are those sensory structures that are distributed throughout the body and in the walls of various
organs. The special senses are all primarily part of the somatic nervous system in that they are consciously perceived
through cerebral processes, though some special senses contribute to autonomic function. The general senses can be divided
into somatosensation, which is commonly considered touch, but includes tactile, pressure, vibration, temperature, and pain
perception. The general senses also include the visceral senses, which are separate from the somatic nervous system function
in that they do not normally rise to the level of conscious perception.

 The cells that transduce sensory stimuli into the electrochemical signals of the nervous system are classified on the
basis of structural or functional aspects of the cells.
