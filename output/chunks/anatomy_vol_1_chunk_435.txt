4.5 | Nervous Tissue Mediates Perception and Response

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Identify the classes of cells that make up nervous tissue
¢ Discuss how nervous tissue mediates perception and response

Nervous tissue is characterized as being excitable and capable of sending and receiving electrochemical signals that provide
the body with information. Two main classes of cells make up nervous tissue: the neuron and neuroglia (Figure 4.19).
 Neurons propagate information via electrochemical impulses, called action potentials, which are biochemically linked to
the release of chemical signals. Neuroglia play an essential role in supporting neurons and modulating their information
propagation.
