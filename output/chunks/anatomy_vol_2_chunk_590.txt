If a person with a sectioned corpus callosum is given the same instructions, they will do something
quite peculiar. They will only put their right hand in their pocket and say they have keys there. They will not even
move their left hand, much less report that there is loose change in the left pocket.

 The reason for this is that the language functions of the cerebral cortex are localized to the left hemisphere in
95 percent of the population. Additionally, the left hemisphere is connected to the right side of the body through the
corticospinal tract and the ascending tracts of the spinal cord. Motor commands from the precentral gyrus control the
opposite side of the body, whereas sensory information processed by the postcentral gyrus is received from the opposite
side of the body. For a verbal command to initiate movement of the right arm and hand, the left side of the brain needs
to be connected by the corpus callosum.
