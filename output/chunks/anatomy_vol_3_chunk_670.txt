Sperm counts—the total number of sperm a man
produces—slowly decline after age 35, and some studies suggest that smoking can lower sperm counts irrespective of age.

 The process of spermatogenesis begins with mitosis of the diploid spermatogonia (Figure 27.5). Because these cells
are diploid (2n), they each have a complete copy of the father’s genetic material, or 46 chromosomes. However, mature
gametes are haploid (1n), containing 23 chromosomes—meaning that daughter cells of spermatogonia must undergo a
second cellular division through the process of meiosis.
