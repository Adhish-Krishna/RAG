Contraction of the external intercostal muscles moves the ribs upward and outward, causing the rib cage to expand, which
increases the volume of the thoracic cavity. Due to the adhesive force of the pleural fluid, the expansion of the thoracic
cavity forces the lungs to stretch and expand as well. This increase in volume leads to a decrease in intra-alveolar pressure,
creating a pressure lower than atmospheric pressure. As a result, a pressure gradient is created that drives air into the lungs.

Figure 22.17 Inspiration and Expiration Inspiration and expiration occur due to the expansion and contraction of
the thoracic cavity, respectively.

 The process of normal expiration is passive, meaning that energy is not required to push air out of the lungs.
