The most common superficial reflex in the neurological exam is the plantar reflex that tests for the Babinski sign on
the basis of the extension or flexion of the toes at the plantar surface of the foot. The plantar reflex is commonly tested in
newborn infants to establish the presence of neuromuscular function. To elicit this reflex, an examiner brushes a stimulus,
usually the examiner’s fingertip, along the plantar surface of the infant’s foot. An infant would present a positive Babinski
sign, meaning the foot dorsiflexes and the toes extend and splay out. As a person learns to walk, the plantar reflex changes
to cause curling of the toes and a moderate plantar flexion. If superficial stimulation of the sole of the foot caused extension
of the foot, keeping one’s balance would be harder. The descending input of the corticospinal tract modifies the response
of the plantar reflex, meaning that a negative Babinski sign is the expected response in testing the reflex.
