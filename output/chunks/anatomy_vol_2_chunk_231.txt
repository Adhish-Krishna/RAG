The circle of Willis is a specialized
arrangement of arteries that ensure constant perfusion of the cerebrum even in the event of a blockage of one of the
arteries in the circle. The animation shows the normal direction of flow through the circle of Willis to the middle
cerebral artery. Where would the blood come from if there were a blockage just posterior to the middle cerebral artery
on the left?

 Venous Return

After passing through the CNS, blood returns to the circulation through a series of dural sinuses and veins (Figure 13.16).
 The superior sagittal sinus runs in the groove of the longitudinal fissure, where it absorbs CSF from the meninges. The
superior sagittal sinus drains to the confluence of sinuses, along with the occipital sinuses and straight sinus, to then drain
into the transverse sinuses. The transverse sinuses connect to the sigmoid sinuses, which then connect to the jugular
veins. From there, the blood continues toward the heart to be pumped to the lungs for reoxygenation.
