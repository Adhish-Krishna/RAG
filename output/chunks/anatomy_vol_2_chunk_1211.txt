Generally as little as 30 minutes of noncontinuous exercise over the course of each day has beneficial effects and has
been shown to lower the rate of heart attack by nearly 50 percent. While it is always advisable to follow a healthy diet,
stop smoking, and lose weight, studies have clearly shown that fit, overweight people may actually be healthier overall than
sedentary slender people. Thus, the benefits of moderate exercise are undeniable.

 Clinical Considerations in Vascular Homeostasis

Any disorder that affects blood volume, vascular tone, or any other aspect of vascular functioning is likely to affect vascular
homeostasis as well. That includes hypertension, hemorrhage, and shock.

Hypertension and Hypotension

Chronically elevated blood pressure is known clinically as hypertension. It is defined as chronic and persistent blood
pressure measurements of 140/90 mm Hg or above. Pressures between 120/80 and 140/90 mm Hg are defined as
prehypertension. About 68 million Americans currently suffer from hypertension. Unfortunately, hypertension is typically
a silent disorder; therefore, hypertensive patients may fail to recognize the seriousness of their condition and fail to follow
their treatment plan.
