Blood capillaries follow the fibroblasts and help increase blood circulation
and oxygen supply to the area. Immune cells, such as macrophages, roam the area and engulf any foreign matter to reduce
the chance of infection.

 Burns

A burn results when the skin is damaged by intense heat, radiation, electricity, or chemicals. The damage results in the death
of skin cells, which can lead to a massive loss of fluid. Dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and renal and circulatory failure
follow, which can be fatal. Burn patients are treated with intravenous fluids to offset dehydration, as well as intravenous
nutrients that enable the body to repair tissues and replace lost proteins. Another serious threat to the lives of burn patients
is infection. Burned skin is extremely susceptible to bacteria and other pathogens, due to the loss of protection by intact
layers of skin.

 Burns are sometimes measured in terms of the size of the total surface area affected.
