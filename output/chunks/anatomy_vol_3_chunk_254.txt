The anal canal includes two sphincters. The internal anal sphincter is made of smooth muscle, and its contractions
are involuntary. The external anal sphincter is made of skeletal muscle, which is under voluntary control. Except when
defecating, both usually remain closed.

 Histology

There are several notable differences between the walls of the large and small intestines (Figure 23.22). For example, few
enzyme-secreting cells are found in the wall of the large intestine, and there are no circular folds or villi. Other than in
the anal canal, the mucosa of the colon is simple columnar epithelium made mostly of enterocytes (absorptive cells) and
goblet cells. In addition, the wall of the large intestine has far more intestinal glands, which contain a vast population of
enterocytes and goblet cells. These goblet cells secrete mucus that eases the movement of feces and protects the intestine
from the effects of the acids and gases produced by enteric bacteria.
