Vitamin D is also synthesized in the skin through exposure to sunlight. Because
they are carried in lipids, fat-soluble vitamins can accumulate in the lipids stored in the body. If excess vitamins are retained
in the lipid stores in the body, hypervitaminosis can result.

 Water-soluble vitamins, including the eight B vitamins and vitamin C, are absorbed with water in the gastrointestinal
tract. These vitamins move easily through bodily fluids, which are water based, so they are not stored in the body. Excess
water-soluble vitamins are excreted in the urine. Therefore, hypervitaminosis of water-soluble vitamins rarely occurs,
except with an excess of vitamin supplements.
