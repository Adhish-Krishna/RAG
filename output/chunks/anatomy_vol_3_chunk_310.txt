There, the micelles release their fats to
diffuse across the cell membrane. The fats are then reassembled into triglycerides and mixed with other lipids and proteins
into chylomicrons that can pass into lacteals. Other absorbed monomers travel from blood capillaries in the villus to the
hepatic portal vein and then to the liver.

 INTERACTIVE LINK QUESTIONS

1. By clicking on this link (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/
fooddigestion) , you can watch a short video of what
happens to the food you eat as it passes from your mouth
to your intestine. Along the way, note how the food changes
consistency and form. How does this change in consistency
facilitate your gaining nutrients from food?

2. Visit this site  (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/
fooddigestion2) for an overview of digestion of food in
different regions of the digestive tract. Note the route of
non-fat nutrients from the small intestine to their release as
nutrients to the body.
