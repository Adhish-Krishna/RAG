Insulin and glucagon are involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin is produced by the beta cells
in response to high blood glucose levels. It enhances glucose uptake and utilization by target cells, as well as the storage of
excess glucose for later use. Dysfunction of the production of insulin or target cell resistance to the effects of insulin causes
diabetes mellitus, a disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels. The hormone glucagon is produced and secreted
by the alpha cells of the pancreas in response to low blood glucose levels. Glucagon stimulates mechanisms that increase
blood glucose levels, such as the catabolism of glycogen into glucose.

 17.10 Organs with Secondary Endocrine Functions

Some organs have a secondary endocrine function. For example, the walls of the atria of the heart produce the hormone
atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), the gastrointestinal tract produces the hormones gastrin, secretin, and cholecystokinin,
which aid in digestion, and the kidneys produce erythropoietin (EPO), which stimulates the formation of red blood cells.
