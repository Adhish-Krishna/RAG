Rh factor also plays a

role. If Rh individuals receiving blood have had prior exposure to Rh antigen, antibodies for this antigen may be present
in the blood and trigger agglutination to some degree. Although it is always preferable to cross match a patient’s blood
before transfusing, in a true life-threatening emergency situation, this is not always possible, and these procedures may be
implemented.

 A patient with blood type AB” is known as the universal recipient. This patient can theoretically receive any type
of blood, because the patient’s own blood—having both A and B antigens on the erythrocyte surface—does not produce
anti-A or anti-B antibodies. In addition, an Rh” patient can receive both Rh* and Rh blood. However, keep in mind that
the donor’s blood will contain circulating antibodies, again with possible negative implications. Figure 18.17 summarizes
the blood types and compatibilities.

 At the scene of multiple-vehicle accidents, military engagements, and natural or human-caused disasters, many
victims may suffer simultaneously from acute hemorrhage, yet type O blood may not be immediately available.
