With the use of tissue
typing and anti-rejection drugs, transplantation of organs and the control of the anti-transplant immune response have made
huge strides in the past 50 years. Today, these procedures are commonplace. Tissue typing is the determination of MHC
molecules in the tissue to be transplanted to better match the donor to the recipient. The immune response to cancer, on the
other hand, has been more difficult to understand and control. Although it is clear that the immune system can recognize
some cancers and control them, others seem to be resistant to immune mechanisms.

 The Rh Factor

Red blood cells can be typed based on their surface antigens. ABO blood type, in which individuals are type A, B, AB, or
O according to their genetics, is one example. A separate antigen system seen on red blood cells is the Rh antigen. When
someone is “A positive” for example, the positive refers to the presence of the Rh antigen, whereas someone who is “A
negative” would lack this molecule.
