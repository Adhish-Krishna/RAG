There are three dilations in the wall of the aorta just
superior to the aortic semilunar valve. Two of these, the left posterior aortic sinus and anterior aortic sinus, give rise to the
left and right coronary arteries, respectively. The third sinus, the right posterior aortic sinus, typically does not give rise
to a vessel. Coronary vessel branches that remain on the surface of the artery and follow the sulci are called epicardial
coronary arteries.

 The left coronary artery distributes blood to the left side of the heart, the left atrium and ventricle, and the
interventricular septum. The circumflex artery arises from the left coronary artery and follows the coronary sulcus to
the left. Eventually, it will fuse with the small branches of the right coronary artery. The larger anterior interventricular
artery, also known as the left anterior descending artery (LAD), is the second major branch arising from the left coronary
artery.
