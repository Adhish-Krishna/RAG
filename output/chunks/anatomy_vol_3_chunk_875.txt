Mendelâ€™s Theory of Inheritance

Our contemporary understanding of genetics rests on the work of a nineteenth-century monk. Working in the mid-1800s,
long before anyone knew about genes or chromosomes, Gregor Mendel discovered that garden peas transmit their physical
characteristics to subsequent generations in a discrete and predictable fashion. When he mated, or crossed, two pure-
breeding pea plants that differed by a certain characteristic, the first-generation offspring all looked like one of the parents.
 For instance, when he crossed tall and dwarf pure-breeding pea plants, all of the offspring were tall. Mendel called tallness
dominant because it was expressed in offspring when it was present in a purebred parent. He called dwarfism recessive
because it was masked in the offspring if one of the purebred parents possessed the dominant characteristic. Note that
tallness and dwarfism are variations on the characteristic of height. Mendel called such a variation a trait. We now know
that these traits are the expression of different alleles of the gene encoding height.
