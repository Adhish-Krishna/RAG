These amino acids have an amino group and a carboxyl group in
their chemical structures. Glutamate is one of the 20 amino acids that are used to make proteins. Each amino acid
neurotransmitter would be part of its own system, namely the glutamatergic, GABAergic, and glycinergic systems. They
each have their own receptors and do not interact with each other. Amino acid neurotransmitters are eliminated from the
synapse by reuptake. A pump in the cell membrane of the presynaptic element, or sometimes a neighboring glial cell, will
clear the amino acid from the synaptic cleft so that it can be recycled, repackaged in vesicles, and released again.

 Another class of neurotransmitter is the biogenic amine, a group of neurotransmitters that are enzymatically made
from amino acids. They have amino groups in them, but no longer have carboxyl groups and are therefore no longer
classified as amino acids. Serotonin is made from tryptophan. It is the basis of the serotonergic system, which has its own
specific receptors.
