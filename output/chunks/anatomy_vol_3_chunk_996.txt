12 The optic
nerve enters the CNS in its projection from the eyes in the periphery, which means that it crosses through the meninges. Meningitis
will include swelling of those protective layers of the CNS, resulting in pressure on the optic nerve, which can compromise
vision. 13C 14B 15A 16D 17A 18D 19C 20B 21A 22B 23C 24A 25A 26B 27D 28C 29D 30A 31

connections from the retina through the optic nerve/tract are to the hypothalamus and thalamus of the diencephalon, and to the
midbrain, which developed directly adjacent to the diencephalon as the mesencephalon in the embryo. 34 The neural crest gives
rise to PNS structures (such as ganglia) and also to cartilage and bone of the face and cranium. 35 The temporal lobe has sensory
functions associated with hearing and vision, as well as being important for memory.
