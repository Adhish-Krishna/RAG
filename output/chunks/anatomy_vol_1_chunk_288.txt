The ER can be thought of as a series of winding
thoroughfares similar to the waterway canals in Venice. The ER provides passages throughout much of the cell that function
in transporting, synthesizing, and storing materials. The winding structure of the ER results in a large membranous surface
area that supports its many functions (Figure 3.14).

Smooth ER

Figure 3.14 Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) (a) The ER is a winding network of thin membranous sacs found in
close association with the cell nucleus. The smooth and rough endoplasmic reticula are very different in appearance
and function (Source: mouse tissue). (b) Rough ER is studded with numerous ribosomes, which are sites of protein
synthesis (Source: mouse tissue). EM x 110,000. (c) Smooth ER synthesizes phospholipids, steroid hormones,
regulates the concentration of cellular Ca**, metabolizes some carbohydrates, and breaks down certain toxins (source:
mouse tissue).
