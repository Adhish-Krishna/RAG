Simple Epithelium

The shape of the cells in the single cell layer of simple epithelium reflects the functioning of those cells. The cells in simple
squamous epithelium have the appearance of thin scales. Squamous cell nuclei tend to be flat, horizontal, and elliptical,
mirroring the form of the cell. The endothelium is the epithelial tissue that lines vessels of the lymphatic and cardiovascular
system, and it is made up of a single layer of squamous cells. Simple squamous epithelium, because of the thinness of the
cell, is present where rapid passage of chemical compounds is observed. The alveoli of lungs where gases diffuse, segments
of kidney tubules, and the lining of capillaries are also made of simple squamous epithelial tissue. The mesothelium is
