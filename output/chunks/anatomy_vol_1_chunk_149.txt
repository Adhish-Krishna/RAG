A positively charged ion is known as a cation.

 54 CHAPTER 2 | THE CHEMICAL LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION

Now consider fluorine (F), a component of bones and teeth. Its atomic number is nine, and it has seven electrons in its
valence shell. Thus, it is highly likely to bond with other atoms in such a way that fluorine accepts one electron (it is easier
for fluorine to gain one electron than to donate seven electrons). When it does, its electrons will outnumber its protons by
one, and it will have an overall negative charge. The ionized form of fluorine is called fluoride, and is written as F. A
negatively charged ion is known as an anion.

 Atoms that have more than one electron to donate or accept will end up with stronger positive or negative charges. A
cation that has donated two electrons has a net charge of +2. Using magnesium (Mg) as an example, this can be written
Mg‚Äù or Mg**.
