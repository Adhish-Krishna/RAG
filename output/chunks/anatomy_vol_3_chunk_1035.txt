MHC molecules. These are taken to the cell surface by transport vesicles. 43
Antigen-specific clones are stimulated as their antigen receptor binds to antigen. They are then activated and proliferate, expanding
their numbers. The result is a large number of antigen-specific lymphocytes. 44 B cells activated during a primary response
differentiate either into terminally differentiated plasma cells or into memory B cells. These memory B cells are what respond
during a secondary or memory antibody response. 45 IgM is an antigen receptor on naive B cells. Upon activation, naive B cells
make IgM first. IgM is good at binding complement and thus has good antibacterial effects. IgM is replaced with other classes
of antibodies later on in the primary response due to class switching. 46 Seroconversion is the clearance of virus in the serum
due to the increase in specific serum antibody levels. Seroconversion happens in the early stages of HIV disease. Unfortunately,
the antibody cannot completely clear the virus from the body and thus it most often progresses to AIDS.
