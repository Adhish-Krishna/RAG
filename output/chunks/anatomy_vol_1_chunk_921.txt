(i) Eversion of the foot moves the bottom (sole) of
the foot away from the midline of the body, while foot inversion faces the sole toward the midline. (j) Protraction of the
mandible pushes the chin forward, and retraction pulls the chin back. (k) Depression of the mandible opens the mouth,
while elevation closes it. (I) Opposition of the thumb brings the tip of the thumb into contact with the tip of the fingers of
the same hand and reposition brings the thumb back next to the index finger.

 Flexion and Extension

Flexion and extension are movements that take place within the sagittal plane and involve anterior or posterior movements
of the body or limbs. For the vertebral column, flexion (anterior flexion) is an anterior (forward) bending of the neck
or body, while extension involves a posterior-directed motion, such as straightening from a flexed position or bending
backward.
