The
mental status exam assesses functions related to the cerebrum. The cranial nerve exam is for the nerves that connect to the
diencephalon and brain stem (as well as the olfactory connections to the forebrain). The coordination exam and the related
gait exam primarily assess the functions of the cerebellum. The motor and sensory exams are associated with the spinal cord
and its connections through the spinal nerves.
