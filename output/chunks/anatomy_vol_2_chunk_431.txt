Reflexes are the simplest circuits within the somatic nervous system. A withdrawal reflex from a painful stimulus
only requires the sensory fiber that enters the spinal cord and the motor neuron that projects to a muscle. Antagonist
and postural muscles can be coordinated with the withdrawal, making the connections more complex. The simple, single
neuronal connection is the basis of somatic reflexes. The corneal reflex is contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle to
blink the eyelid when something touches the surface of the eye. Stretch reflexes maintain a constant length of muscles by
causing a contraction of a muscle to compensate for a stretch that can be sensed by a specialized receptor called a muscle
spindle.
