CHAPTER 28 | DEVELOPMENT AND INHERITANCE 1247

Endometrium Uterine cavity

Uterine mucosa cells

@ The blastocyst digests the uterine
mucosa when it initially implants into
the endometrium.

 ® Eventually, the endometrium
grows over and surrounds the
embryo, fully securing it to the
uterine lining.

 ® Implanted embryo

continues to grow within
endometrium. (Depicted
embryo is 7-8 weeks
after conception.)

 Figure 28.6 Implantation During implantation, the trophoblast cells of the blastocyst adhere to the endometrium and
digest endometrial cells until it is attached securely.

 Most of the time an embryo implants within the body of the uterus in a location that can support growth and
development. However, in one to two percent of cases, the embryo implants either outside the uterus (an ectopic
pregnancy) or in a region of uterus that can create complications for the pregnancy.
