At that rate, an extra 20

 The type of food ingested also affects the bodyâ€™s metabolic rate. Processing of carbohydrates requires less energy than
processing of proteins. In fact, the breakdown of carbohydrates requires the least amount of energy, whereas the processing
of proteins demands the most energy. In general, the amount of calories ingested and the amount of calories burned
determines the overall weight. To lose weight, the number of calories burned per day must exceed the number ingested.
 Calories are in almost everything you ingest, so when considering calorie intake, beverages must also be considered.

 To help provide guidelines regarding the types and quantities of food that should be eaten every day, the USDA has
updated their food guidelines from MyPyramid to MyPlate.
