Creatine phosphate is a molecule that can store energy in its phosphate bonds. In a resting muscle, excess ATP
transfers its energy to creatine, producing ADP and creatine phosphate. This acts as an energy reserve that can be used to
quickly create more ATP. When the muscle starts to contract and needs energy, creatine phosphate transfers its phosphate
back to ADP to form ATP and creatine. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme creatine kinase and occurs very quickly;
thus, creatine phosphate-derived ATP powers the first few seconds of muscle contraction. However, creatine phosphate can
only provide approximately 15 seconds worth of energy, at which point another energy source has to be used (Figure 10.12).
