to form about day 28. The atrioventricular valves form between weeks five to eight. At this point, the heart ventricles resemble the
adult structure.

receive blood from arteries, which are vessels with a much larger lumen. As their own lumen averages just 30 micrometers or
less, arterioles are critical in slowing down—or resisting—blood flow. The arterioles can also constrict or dilate, which varies their
resistance, to help distribute blood flow to the tissues. 29 Vasoconstriction causes the lumens of blood vessels to narrow. This
increases the pressure of the blood flowing within the vessel. 30 This isa venule. 31 The patient’s pulse pressure is 130 — 85 = 45
mm Hg.
