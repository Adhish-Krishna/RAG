Thus, the
ovum can be thought of as a brief, transitional, haploid stage between the diploid oocyte and diploid zygote.

 1218 CHAPTER 27 | THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM

 The larger amount of cytoplasm contained in the female gamete is used to supply the developing zygote with nutrients

during the period between fertilization and implantation into the uterus. Interestingly, sperm contribute only DNA at
fertilization —not cytoplasm. Therefore, the cytoplasm and all of the cytoplasmic organelles in the developing embryo are

of

maternal origin. This includes mitochondria, which contain their own DNA. Scientific research in the 1980s determined

that mitochondrial DNA was maternally inherited, meaning that you can trace your mitochondrial DNA directly to your
mother, her mother, and so on back through your female ancestors.

Mapping Human History with Mitochondrial DNA

When we talk about human DNA, we’re usually referring to nuclear DNA; that is, the DNA coiled into chromosomal
bundles in the nucleus of our cells.
