The standard is to compare
the inside of the cell relative to the outside, so the membrane potential is a value representing the charge on the intracellular
side of the membrane based on the outside being zero, relatively speaking (Figure 12.22).

Figure 12.22 Measuring Charge across a Membrane with a Voltmeter A recording electrode is inserted into the
cell and a reference electrode is outside the cell. By comparing the charge measured by these two electrodes, the
transmembrane voltage is determined. It is conventional to express that value for the cytosol relative to the outside.

 The concentration of ions in extracellular and intracellular fluids is largely balanced, with a net neutral charge.
