Notice how this is different from Paget’s
disease. In Paget’s disease, new bone is formed in an attempt to keep up with the resorption by the overactive
osteoclasts, but that new bone is produced haphazardly. In fact, when a physician is evaluating a patient with thinning
bone, he or she will test for osteoporosis and Paget’s disease (as well as other diseases). Osteoporosis does not have
the elevated blood levels of alkaline phosphatase found in Paget’s disease.
