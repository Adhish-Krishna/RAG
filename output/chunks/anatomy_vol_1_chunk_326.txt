This process results in a much larger variety of possible proteins
and protein functions. When the mRNA transcript is ready, it travels out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm.

 From RNA to Protein: Translation

Like translating a book from one language into another, the codons on a strand of mRNA must be translated into the
amino acid alphabet of proteins. Translation is the process of synthesizing a chain of amino acids called a polypeptide.
 Translation requires two major aids: first, a “translator,” the molecule that will conduct the translation, and second, a
substrate on which the mRNA strand is translated into a new protein, like the translator’s “desk.”
