Figure 2.26 The Shape of Proteins (a) The primary structure is the sequence of amino acids that make up the
polypeptide chain. (b) The secondary structure, which can take the form of an alpha-helix or a beta-pleated sheet,
is maintained by hydrogen bonds between amino acids in different regions of the original polypeptide strand. (c) The
tertiary structure occurs as a result of further folding and bonding of the secondary structure. (d) The quaternary
structure occurs as a result of interactions between two or more tertiary subunits. The example shown here is
hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells which transports oxygen to body tissues.

 Although some polypeptides exist as linear chains, most are twisted or folded into more complex secondary structures
that form when bonding occurs between amino acids with different properties at different regions of the polypeptide.
