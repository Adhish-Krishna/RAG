Watch this video  (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/
reflextest) to see how to test reflexes in the abdomen.
 Testing reflexes of the trunk is not commonly performed
in the neurological exam, but if findings suggest a problem
with the thoracic segments of the spinal cord, a series of
superficial reflexes of the abdomen can localize function to
those segments. If contraction is not observed when the skin
lateral to the umbilicus (belly button) is stimulated, what
level of the spinal cord may be damaged?

8. Watch this short video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/
stationtest) to see a test for station. Station refers to the
position a person adopts when they are standing still. The
examiner would look for issues with balance, which
coordinates proprioceptive, vestibular, and visual
information in the cerebellum. To test the ability of a subject
to maintain balance, asking them to stand or hop on one foot
can be more demanding.
