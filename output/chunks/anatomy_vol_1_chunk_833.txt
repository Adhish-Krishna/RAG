This expanded base of the fifth metatarsal can be felt as a bony bump at the midpoint along the lateral border of the foot.
 The expanded distal end of each metatarsal is the head of the metatarsal bone. Each metatarsal bone articulates with the
proximal phalanx of a toe to form a metatarsophalangeal joint. The heads of the metatarsal bones also rest on the ground
and form the ball (anterior end) of the foot.

 Phalanges

The toes contain a total of 14 phalanx bones (phalanges), arranged in a similar manner as the phalanges of the fingers
(see Figure 8.19). The toes are numbered 1-5, starting with the big toe ( hallux). The big toe has two phalanx bones, the
proximal and distal phalanges. The remaining toes all have proximal, middle, and distal phalanges. A joint between adjacent
phalanx bones is called an interphalangeal joint.

of the foot, next to the first metatarsophalangeal joint, at the base of the big toe.
