Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by decreased bone mass that is common
in aging adults. Calcitriol stimulates the digestive tract to absorb calcium and phosphate. Parathyroid hormone (PTH)
stimulates osteoclast proliferation and resorption of bone by osteoclasts. Vitamin D plays a synergistic role with PTH in
stimulating the osteoclasts. Additional functions of PTH include promoting reabsorption of calcium by kidney tubules
and indirectly increasing calcium absorption from the small intestine. Calcitonin inhibits osteoclast activity and stimulates
calcium uptake by bones.

6.7 Calcium Homeostasis: Interactions of the Skeletal System and Other Organ Systems

Calcium homeostasis, i.e., maintaining a blood calcium level of about 10 mg/dL, is critical for normal body functions.
 Hypocalcemia can result in problems with blood coagulation, muscle contraction, nerve functioning, and bone strength.
 Hypercalcemia can result in lethargy, sluggish reflexes, constipation and loss of appetite, confusion, and coma. Calcium
homeostasis is controlled by PTH, vitamin D, and calcitonin and the interactions of the skeletal, endocrine, digestive, and

urinary systems.
