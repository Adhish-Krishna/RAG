This drawing of the connections of the eye to the brain shows the optic
nerve extending from the eye to the chiasm, where the structure continues as the optic tract. The same axons extend
from the eye to the brain through these two bundles of fibers, but the chiasm represents the border between peripheral
and central.

In 2003, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Paul C. Lauterbur and Sir Peter Mansfield for
discoveries related to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This is a tool to see the structures of the body (not just the
nervous system) that depends on magnetic fields associated with certain atomic nuclei. The utility of this technique
in the nervous system is that fat tissue and water appear as different shades between black and white. Because white
matter is fatty (from myelin) and gray matter is not, they can be easily distinguished in MRI images.
