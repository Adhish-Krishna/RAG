This stabilizes the fracture.

 Over the next several weeks, osteoclasts resorb the dead bone; osteogenic cells become active, divide, and differentiate
into osteoblasts. The cartilage in the calli is replaced by trabecular bone via endochondral ossification (Figure 6.2 1c).

 Eventually, the internal and external calli unite, compact bone replaces spongy bone at the outer margins of the
fracture, and healing is complete. A slight swelling may remain on the outer surface of the bone, but quite often, that region
undergoes remodeling (Figure 6.21d), and no external evidence of the fracture remains.
