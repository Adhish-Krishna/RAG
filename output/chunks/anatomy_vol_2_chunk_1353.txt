The phagocytes are the bodyâ€™s fast acting, first line of immunological defense against organisms that have
breached barrier defenses and have entered the vulnerable tissues of the body.

 Phagocytes: Macrophages and Neutrophils

Many of the cells of the immune system have a phagocytic ability, at least at some point during their life cycles.
 Phagocytosis is an important and effective mechanism of destroying pathogens during innate immune responses. The
phagocyte takes the organism inside itself as a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with a lysosome and its digestive
enzymes, effectively killing many pathogens. On the other hand, some bacteria including Mycobacteria tuberculosis, the
cause of tuberculosis, may be resistant to these enzymes and are therefore much more difficult to clear from the body.
 Macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells are the major phagocytes of the immune system.

 A macrophage is an irregularly shaped phagocyte that is amoeboid in nature and is the most versatile of the phagocytes
in the body.
