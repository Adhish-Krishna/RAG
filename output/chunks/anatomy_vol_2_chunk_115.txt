There is a high density of
voltage-gated Na” channels so that rapid depolarization can take place here. Going down the length of the axon, the action
potential is propagated because more voltage-gated Na” channels are opened as the depolarization spreads. This spreading
occurs because Na” enters through the channel and moves along the inside of the cell membrane. As the Na” moves, or
‘lows, a short distance along the cell membrane, its positive charge depolarizes a little more of the cell membrane. As that

depolarization spreads, new voltage-gated Na® channels open and more ions rush into the cell, spreading the depolarization
a little farther.

 Because voltage-gated Na” channels are inactivated at the peak of the depolarization, they cannot be opened again
or a brief time—the absolute refractory period. Because of this, depolarization spreading back toward previously opened
channels has no effect. The action potential must propagate toward the axon terminals; as a result, the polarity of the neuron
is maintained, as mentioned above.
