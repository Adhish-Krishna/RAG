CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 667

The Cranial Nerve Exam

The cranial nerves can be separated into four major groups associated with the subtests of the cranial nerve exam. First are
the sensory nerves, then the nerves that control eye movement, the nerves of the oral cavity and superior pharynx, and the
nerve that controls movements of the neck.
 The olfactory, optic, and vestibulocochlear nerves are strictly sensory nerves for smell, sight, and balance and hearing,
whereas the trigeminal, facial, and glossopharyngeal nerves carry somatosensation of the face, and tasteâ€”separated
between the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and the posterior one-third. Special senses are tested by presenting the
particular stimuli to each receptive organ. General senses can be tested through sensory discrimination of touch versus
painful stimuli.
 The oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves control the extraocular muscles and are connected by the medial
longitudinal fasciculus to coordinate gaze.
