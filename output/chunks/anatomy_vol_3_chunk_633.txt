* Step 2: The cells produce bicarbonate ions that can be shunted to peritubular capillaries.

 Â¢ Step 3: When CO? is available, the reaction is driven to the formation of carbonic acid, which dissociates to form a
bicarbonate ion and a hydrogen ion.

 * Step 4: The bicarbonate ion passes into the peritubular capillaries and returns to the blood. The hydrogen ion is secreted
into the filtrate, where it can become part of new water molecules and be reabsorbed as such, or removed in the urine.

Figure 26.17 Conservation of Bicarbonate in the Kidney Tubular cells are not permeable to bicarbonate; thus,
bicarbonate is conserved rather than reabsorbed.
