Coronary Veins

Coronary veins drain the heart and generally parallel the large surface arteries (see Figure 19.15). The great cardiac
vein can be seen initially on the surface of the heart following the interventricular sulcus, but it eventually flows along
the coronary sulcus into the coronary sinus on the posterior surface. The great cardiac vein initially parallels the anterior
interventricular artery and drains the areas supplied by this vessel. It receives several major branches, including the posterior
cardiac vein, the middle cardiac vein, and the small cardiac vein. The posterior cardiac vein parallels and drains the
areas supplied by the marginal artery branch of the circumflex artery. The middle cardiac vein parallels and drains the
areas supplied by the posterior interventricular artery. The small cardiac vein parallels the right coronary artery and drains
the blood from the posterior surfaces of the right atrium and ventricle. The coronary sinus is a large, thin-walled vein on
the posterior surface of the heart lying within the atrioventricular sulcus and emptying directly into the right atrium.
