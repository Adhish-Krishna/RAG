In fact, the membrane potential can be
described as a battery. A charge is stored across the membrane that can be released under the correct conditions. A battery
in your remote has stored a charge that is “released” when you push a button.

Figure 12.23 Graph of Action Potential Plotting voltage measured across the cell membrane against time, the
action potential begins with depolarization, followed by repolarization, which goes past the resting potential into
hyperpolarization, and finally the membrane returns to rest.

 What happens across the membrane of an electrically active cell is a dynamic process that is hard to visualize with
static images or through text descriptions. View this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/dynamic1) to learn

more about this process. What is the difference between the driving force for Na* and K*? And what is similar about
the movement of these two ions?

 The question is, now, what initiates the action potential?
