Figure 7.33 Newborn Skull The bones of the newborn skull are not fully ossified and are separated by large areas
called fontanelles, which are filled with fibrous connective tissue. The fontanelles allow for continued growth of the skull
after birth. At the time of birth, the facial bones are small and underdeveloped, and the mastoid process has not yet
formed.

 Development of the Vertebral Column and Thoracic cage

Development of the vertebrae begins with the accumulation of mesenchyme cells from each sclerotome around the
notochord. These cells differentiate into a hyaline cartilage model for each vertebra, which then grow and eventually
ossify into bone through the process of endochondral ossification. As the developing vertebrae grow, the notochord largely
disappears. However, small areas of notochord tissue persist between the adjacent vertebrae and this contributes to the
formation of each intervertebral disc.

 The ribs and sternum also develop from mesenchyme. The ribs initially develop as part of the cartilage model for each
vertebra, but in the thorax region, the rib portion separates from the vertebra by the eighth week.
