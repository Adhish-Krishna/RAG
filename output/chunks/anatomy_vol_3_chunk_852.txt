High
carbon dioxide levels cause acidosis and stimulate the respiratory center in the brain, triggering the newborn to take a breath.

 The first breath typically is taken within 10 seconds of birth, after mucus is aspirated from the infant’s mouth and nose.
 The first breaths inflate the lungs to nearly full capacity and dramatically decrease lung pressure and resistance to blood
flow, causing a major circulatory reconfiguration. Pulmonary alveoli open, and alveolar capillaries fill with blood. Amniotic
fluid in the lungs drains or is absorbed, and the lungs immediately take over the task of the placenta, exchanging carbon
dioxide for oxygen by the process of respiration.

 Circulatory Adjustments

The process of clamping and cutting the umbilical cord collapses the umbilical blood vessels. In the absence of medical
assistance, this occlusion would occur naturally within 20 minutes of birth because the Wharton’s jelly within the umbilical
cord would swell in response to the lower temperature outside of the mother’s body, and the blood vessels would constrict.
