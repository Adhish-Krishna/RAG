Some smooth muscle can also maintain contractions

even as Ca** is removed and myosin kinase is inactivated/dephosphorylated. This can happen as a subset of cross-bridges
between myosin heads and actin, called latch-bridges, keep the thick and thin filaments linked together for a prolonged
period, and without the need for ATP. This allows for the maintaining of muscle “tone” in smooth muscle that lines arterioles
and other visceral organs with very little energy expenditure.

 Smooth muscle is not under voluntary control; thus, it is called involuntary muscle. The triggers for smooth muscle
contraction include hormones, neural stimulation by the ANS, and local factors. In certain locations, such as the walls of
visceral organs, stretching the muscle can trigger its contraction (the stretch-relaxation response).

 Axons of neurons in the ANS do not form the highly organized NMJs with smooth muscle, as seen between motor
neurons and skeletal muscle fibers.
