The mouth includes the lips, tongue, palate, gums, and teeth.

 A fleshy bead of tissue called the uvula drops down from the center of the posterior edge of the soft palate. Although
some have suggested that the uvula is a vestigial organ, it serves an important purpose. When you swallow, the soft
palate and uvula move upward, helping to keep foods and liquid from entering the nasal cavity. Unfortunately, it can also
contribute to the sound produced by snoring. Two muscular folds extend downward from the soft palate, on either side of
the uvula. Toward the front, the palatoglossal arch lies next to the base of the tongue; behind it, the palatopharyngeal arch
forms the superior and lateral margins of the fauces. Between these two arches are the palatine tonsils, clusters of lymphoid
tissue that protect the pharynx. The lingual tonsils are located at the base of the tongue.

 The Tongue

 Perhaps you have heard it said that the tongue is the strongest muscle in the body.
