wave is the same as
sound wave

Figure 14.6 Transmission of Sound Waves to Cochlea A sound wave causes the tympanic membrane to vibrate.
 This vibration is amplified as it moves across the malleus, incus, and stapes. The amplified vibration is picked up by
the oval window causing pressure waves in the fluid of the scala vestibuli and scala tympani. The complexity of the
pressure waves is determined by the changes in amplitude and frequency of the sound waves entering the ear.

 A cross-sectional view of the cochlea shows that the scala vestibuli and scala tympani run along both sides of the
cochlear duct (Figure 14.7). The cochlear duct contains several organs of Corti, which tranduce the wave motion of the
two scala into neural signals. The organs of Corti lie on top of the basilar membrane, which is the side of the cochlear duct
located between the organs of Corti and the scala tympani.
