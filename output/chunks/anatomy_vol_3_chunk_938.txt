Blood contains formed elements derived from bone marrow. Erythrocytes, or red blood cells, transport the gases oxygen
and carbon dioxide. Leukocytes, or white blood cells, are responsible for the defense of the organism against potentially harmful
microorganisms or molecules. Platelets are cell fragments involved in blood clotting. Some cells have the ability to cross the
endothelial layer that lines vessels and enter adjacent tissues. Nutrients, salts, and waste are dissolved in the liquid matrix and
transported through the body. 37 A layer of dense irregular connective tissue covers cartilage. No blood vessels supply cartilage
tissue. Injuries to cartilage heal very slowly because cells and nutrients needed for repair diffuse slowly to the injury site. 38 The
cells in the dish are cardiomyocytes, cardiac muscle cells. They have an intrinsic ability to contract. When they link up, they form
intercalating discs that allow the cells to communicate with each other and begin contracting in synchrony.
