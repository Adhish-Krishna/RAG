The posterior cranial fossa is the deepest fossa. It extends from the petrous ridge anteriorly to the occipital bone posteriorly. The
large foramen magnum is located at the midline of the posterior fossa. 32 There are two bony parts of the nasal septum in the dry
skull. The perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone forms the superior part of the septum. The vomer bone forms the inferior and
posterior parts of the septum. In the living skull, the septal cartilage completes the septum by filling in the anterior area between the
bony components and extending outward into the nose. 33 The adult vertebral column consists of 24 vertebrae, plus the sacrum
and coccyx. The vertebrae are subdivided into cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions. There are seven cervical vertebrae (C1—C7),
12 thoracic vertebrae (T1-T12), and five lumbar vertebrae (L1—L5).
