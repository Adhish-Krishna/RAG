cerebral cortex. Why would this be the case based on
propagation of the axon potential?

42. If a postsynaptic cell has synapses from five different
cells, and three cause EPSPs and two of them cause IPSPs,
give an example of a series of depolarizations and
hyperpolarizations that would result in the neuron reaching
