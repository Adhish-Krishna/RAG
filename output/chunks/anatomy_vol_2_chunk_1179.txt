The more rounded
the lumen, the less surface area the blood encounters, and the less resistance the vessel offers. Vasoconstriction increases
pressure within a vein as it does in an artery, but in veins, the increased pressure increases flow. Recall that the pressure
in the atria, into which the venous blood will flow, is very low, approaching zero for at least part of the relaxation phase
of the cardiac cycle. Thus, venoconstriction increases the return of blood to the heart. Another way of stating this is that
venoconstriction increases the preload or stretch of the cardiac muscle and increases contraction.

20.3 | Capillary Exchange

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Identify the primary mechanisms of capillary exchange

¢ Distinguish between capillary hydrostatic pressure and blood colloid osmotic pressure, explaining the contribution
of each to net filtration pressure

* Compare filtration and reabsorption
