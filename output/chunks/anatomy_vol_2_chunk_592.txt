A few tests are run to demonstrate how this manifests in tests of cerebral function. Unlike
normal people, this patient can perform two independent tasks at the same time because the lines of communication
between the right and left sides of his brain have been removed. Whereas a person with an intact corpus callosum
cannot overcome the dominance of one hemisphere over the other, this patient can. If the left cerebral hemisphere is
dominant in the majority of people, why would right-handedness be most common?

 The Mental Status Exam

The cerebrum, particularly the cerebral cortex, is the location of important cognitive functions that are the focus of
the mental status exam. The regionalization of the cortex, initially described on the basis of anatomical evidence of
cytoarchitecture, reveals the distribution of functionally distinct areas. Cortical regions can be described as primary sensory
or motor areas, association areas, or multimodal integration areas. The functions attributed to these regions include attention,
memory, language, speech, sensation, judgment, and abstract reasoning.
