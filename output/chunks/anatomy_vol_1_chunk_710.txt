The fused spinous processes form the median sacral crest, while the lateral
sacral crest arises from the fused transverse processes. The coccyx is formed by the fusion of four small coccygeal
vertebrae.

 Intervertebral Discs and Ligaments of the Vertebral Column

The bodies of adjacent vertebrae are strongly anchored to each other by an intervertebral disc. This structure provides
padding between the bones during weight bearing, and because it can change shape, also allows for movement between
the vertebrae. Although the total amount of movement available between any two adjacent vertebrae is small, when these
movements are summed together along the entire length of the vertebral column, large body movements can be produced.
 Ligaments that extend along the length of the vertebral column also contribute to its overall support and stability.

 Intervertebral Disc

An intervertebral disc is a fibrocartilaginous pad that fills the gap between adjacent vertebral bodies (see Figure 7.24).
 Each disc is anchored to the bodies of its adjacent vertebrae, thus strongly uniting these.
