Although, usually thought of as
the primary pathogen-killing cell of the inflammatory process of the innate immune response, new research has suggested
that neutrophils play a role in the adaptive immune response as well, just as macrophages do.

 A monocyte is a circulating precursor cell that differentiates into either a macrophage or dendritic cell, which can be
rapidly attracted to areas of infection by signal molecules of inflammation.

Natural Killer Cells

NK cells are a type of lymphocyte that have the ability to induce apoptosis, that is, programmed cell death, in cells
infected with intracellular pathogens such as obligate intracellular bacteria and viruses.
