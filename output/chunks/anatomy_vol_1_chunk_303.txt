Figure 3.18 The Three Components of the Cytoskeleton The cytoskeleton consists of (a) microtubules, (b)
microfilaments, and (c) intermediate filaments. The cytoskeleton plays an important role in maintaining cell shape and
structure, promoting cellular movement, and aiding cell division.

 A very important function of microtubules is to set the paths (somewhat like railroad tracks) along which the genetic
material can be pulled (a process requiring ATP) during cell division, so that each new daughter cell receives the appropriate
set of chromosomes. Two short, identical microtubule structures called centrioles are found near the nucleus of cells. A
centriole can serve as the cellular origin point for microtubules extending outward as cilia or flagella or can assist with the
