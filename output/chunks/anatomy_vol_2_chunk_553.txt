Neuroanatomy and the Neurological Exam

Localization of function is the concept that circumscribed locations are responsible for specific functions. The neurological
exam highlights this relationship. For example, the cognitive functions that are assessed in the mental status exam are based
on functions in the cerebrum, mostly in the cerebral cortex. Several of the subtests examine language function. Deficits in
neurological function uncovered by these examinations usually point to damage to the left cerebral cortex. In the majority
of individuals, language function is localized to the left hemisphere between the superior temporal lobe and the posterior
frontal lobe, including the intervening connections through the inferior parietal lobe.
