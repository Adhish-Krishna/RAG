Lifting the front of the foot, so
that the top of the foot moves toward the anterior leg is dorsiflexion, while lifting the heel of the foot from the ground or
pointing the toes downward is plantar flexion. These are the only movements available at the ankle joint (see Figure 9.13h).

 Inversion and Eversion

Inversion and eversion are complex movements that involve the multiple plane joints among the tarsal bones of the posterior
foot (intertarsal joints) and thus are not motions that take place at the ankle joint. Inversion is the turning of the foot to
angle the bottom of the foot toward the midline, while eversion turns the bottom of the foot away from the midline. The
foot has a greater range of inversion than eversion motion. These are important motions that help to stabilize the foot when
walking or running on an uneven surface and aid in the quick side-to-side changes in direction used during active sports
such as basketball, racquetball, or soccer (see Figure 9.13i).
