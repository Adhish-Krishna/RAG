End systolic
volume (ESV)

Stroke Volume (SV) = EDV - ESV

Figure 19.35 Summary of Major Factors Influencing Cardiac Output The primary factors influencing HR include
autonomic innervation plus endocrine control. Not shown are environmental factors, such as electrolytes, metabolic
products, and temperature. The primary factors controlling SV include preload, contractility, and afterload. Other factors
such as electrolytes may be classified as either positive or negative inotropic agents.

826 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART

Cardiac Response to Decreasing Blood Flow and Pressure Due to Decreasing
Cardiac Output

Baroreceptors (aorta, carotid arteries,

venae cavae, and atria)

Chemoreceptors (both central nervous
system and in proximity to
baroreceptors)

Sensitive Decreasing stretch Decreasing O2 and increasing CO2, Hâ€™, and lactic
to acid
Target Parasympathetic stimulation suppressed Sympathetic stimulation increased
