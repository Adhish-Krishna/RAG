This process is regulated by PTH, vitamin D,
and calcitonin.

 Cells of the parathyroid gland have plasma membrane receptors for calcium. When calcium is not binding to these
receptors, the cells release PTH, which stimulates osteoclast proliferation and resorption of bone by osteoclasts. This
demineralization process releases calcium into the blood. PTH promotes reabsorption of calcium from the urine by the
kidneys, so that the calcium returns to the blood. Finally, PTH stimulates the synthesis of vitamin D, which in turn,
stimulates calcium absorption from any digested food in the small intestine.

 When all these processes return blood calcium levels to normal, there is enough calcium to bind with the receptors on
the surface of the cells of the parathyroid glands, and this cycle of events is turned off (Figure 6.24).
