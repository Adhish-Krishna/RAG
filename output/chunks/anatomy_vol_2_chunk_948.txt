By applying pressure with the flat portion of one hand on the sternum in
the area between the line at T4 and T9 (Figure 19.3), it is possible to manually compress the blood within the heart
enough to push some of the blood within it into the pulmonary and systemic circuits. This is particularly critical for the
brain, as irreversible damage and death of neurons occur within minutes of loss of blood flow. Current standards call
for compression of the chest at least 5 cm deep and at a rate of 100 compressions per minute, a rate equal to the beat
in “Staying Alive,” recorded in 1977 by the Bee Gees. If you are unfamiliar with this song, a version is available on
www.youtube.com. At this stage, the emphasis is on performing high-quality chest compressions, rather than providing
artificial respiration. CPR is generally performed until the patient regains spontaneous contraction or is declared dead
by an experienced healthcare professional.
