The pharynx,
which plays roles in breathing and vocalization as well as digestion, runs from the nasal and oral cavities superiorly to
the esophagus inferiorly (for digestion) and to the larynx anteriorly (for respiration). During deglutition (swallowing), the
soft palate rises to close off the nasopharynx, the larynx elevates, and the epiglottis folds over the glottis. The esophagus
includes an upper esophageal sphincter made of skeletal muscle, which regulates the movement of food from the pharynx
to the esophagus. It also has a lower esophageal sphincter, made of smooth muscle, which controls the passage of food from
the esophagus to the stomach. Cells in the esophageal wall secrete mucus that eases the passage of the food bolus.

23.4 The Stomach

The stomach participates in all digestive activities except ingestion and defecation. It vigorously churns food. It secretes
gastric juices that break down food and absorbs certain drugs, including aspirin and some alcohol.
