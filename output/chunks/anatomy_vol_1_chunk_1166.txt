The erector spinae group forms the majority of the muscle mass of the back and it is the primary extensor of the
vertebral column. It controls flexion, lateral flexion, and rotation of the vertebral column, and maintains the lumbar curve.
 The erector spinae comprises the iliocostalis (laterally placed) group, the longissimus (intermediately placed) group, and
the spinalis (medially placed) group.

 The iliocostalis group includes the iliocostalis cervicis, associated with the cervical region; the iliocostalis thoracis,
associated with the thoracic region; and the iliocostalis lumborum, associated with the lumbar region. The three muscles
of the longissimus group are the longissimus capitis, associated with the head region; the longissimus cervicis, associated
with the cervical region; and the longissimus thoracis, associated with the thoracic region. The third group, the spinalis
group, comprises the spinalis capitis (head region), the spinalis cervicis (cervical region), and the spinalis thoracis
(thoracic region).
