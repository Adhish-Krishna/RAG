The endocrine system uses chemical signals called hormones
to convey information from one part of the body to a distant part of the body. Hormones are released from the endocrine cell
into the extracellular environment, but then travel in the bloodstream to target tissues. This communication and response can
take seconds to days. In contrast, neurons transmit electrical signals along their axons. At the axon terminal, the electrical signal
prompts the release of a chemical signal called a neurotransmitter that carries the message across the synaptic cleft to elicit a
response in the neighboring cell. This method of communication is nearly instantaneous, of very brief duration, and is highly
specific. 39 Endocrine glands are ductless. They release their secretion into the surrounding fluid, from which it enters the
bloodstream or lymph to travel to distant cells. Moreover, the secretions of endocrine glands are hormones. Exocrine glands
release their secretions through a duct that delivers the secretion to the target location.
