NFP changes at different points in a capillary bed (Figure 20.16). Close to the arterial end of the capillary, it is
approximately 10 mm Hg, because the CHP of 35 mm Hg minus the BCOP of 25 mm Hg equals 10 mm Hg. Recall that the
hydrostatic and osmotic pressures of the interstitial fluid are essentially negligible. Thus, the NFP of 10 mm Hg drives a net
movement of fluid out of the capillary at the arterial end. At approximately the middle of the capillary, the CHP is about the
same as the BCOP of 25 mm Hg, so the NFP drops to zero. At this point, there is no net change of volume: Fluid moves out
of the capillary at the same rate as it moves into the capillary. Near the venous end of the capillary, the CHP has dwindled
to about 18 mm Hg due to loss of fluid. Because the BCOP remains steady at 25 mm Hg, water is drawn into the capillary,
that is, reabsorption occurs.
