Hypotonic muscles have a flaccid appearance and display functional impairments, such as weak
reflexes. Conversely, excessive muscle tone is referred to as hypertonia, accompanied by hyperreflexia (excessive reflex
responses), often the result of damage to upper motor neurons in the CNS. Hypertonia can present with muscle rigidity
(as seen in Parkinson’s disease) or spasticity, a phasic change in muscle tone, where a limb will “snap” back from passive
stretching (as seen in some strokes).

 10.5 | Types of Muscle Fibers

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Describe the types of skeletal muscle fibers

¢ Explain fast and slow muscle fibers

Two criteria to consider when classifying the types of muscle fibers are how fast some fibers contract relative to others,
and how fibers produce ATP.
