Dynamic, Learner-Centered Art

Our unique approach to visuals is designed to emphasize only the components most important in any given illustration.
 The art style is particularly aimed at focusing student learning through a powerful blend of traditional depictions and
instructional innovations.

 Much of the art in this book consists of black line illustrations. The strongest line is used to highlight the most
important structures, and shading is used to show dimension and shape. Color is used sparingly to highlight and clarify
the primary anatomical or functional point of the illustration. This technique is intended to draw studentsâ€™ attention to the
critical learning point in the illustration, without distraction from excessive gradients, shadows, and highlights. Full color is
used when the structure or process requires it (for example, muscle diagrams and cardiovascular system illustrations).

 By highlighting the most important portions of the illustration, the artwork helps students focus on the most important
points, without overwhelming them.
