The interosseous membranes of the leg and forearm also provide areas for muscle attachment. Damage to a
syndesmotic joint, which usually results from a fracture of the bone with an accompanying tear of the interosseous
membrane, will produce pain, loss of stability of the bones, and may damage the muscles attached to the interosseous
membrane. If the fracture site is not properly immobilized with a cast or splint, contractile activity by these muscles can
cause improper alignment of the broken bones during healing.

 Gomphosis

A gomphosis (“fastened with bolts”) is the specialized fibrous joint that anchors the root of a tooth into its bony socket
within the maxillary bone (upper jaw) or mandible bone (lower jaw) of the skull. A gomphosis is also known as a peg-and-
socket joint. Spanning between the bony walls of the socket and the root of the tooth are numerous short bands of dense
connective tissue, each of which is called a periodontal ligament (see Figure 9.5c).
