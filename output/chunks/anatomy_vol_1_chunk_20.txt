philanthropic foundations.

 About OpenStax College’s Resources

OpenStax College resources provide quality academic instruction. Three key features set our materials apart from others:
1) They can be easily customized by instructors for each class, 2) they are “living” resources that grow online through
contributions from science educators, and 3) they are available for free or for a minimal cost.

 Customization

OpenStax College learning resources are conceived and written with flexibility in mind so that they can be customized for
each course. Our textbooks provide a solid foundation on which instructors can build their own texts. Instructors can select
the sections that are most relevant to their curricula and create a textbook that speaks directly to the needs of their students.
 Instructors are encouraged to expand on existing examples in the text by adding unique context via geographically localized
applications and topical connections.
