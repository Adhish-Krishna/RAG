Eventually,
there is nowhere else for the thin filaments to go and the amount of tension is diminished. If the muscle is stretched to the
point where thick and thin filaments do not overlap at all, no cross-bridges can be formed, and no tension is produced in that
sarcomere. This amount of stretching does not usually occur, as accessory proteins and connective tissue oppose extreme
stretching.
