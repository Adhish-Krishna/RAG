This is
followed by the growth of axillary and pubic hair. A growth spurt normally starts at approximately age 9 to 11, and may last
two years or more. During this time, a girl’s height can increase 3 inches a year. The next step in puberty is menarche, the
start of menstruation.

 In boys, the growth of the testes is typically the first physical sign of the beginning of puberty, which is followed by
growth and pigmentation of the scrotum and growth of the penis. The next step is the growth of hair, including armpit,
pubic, chest, and facial hair. Testosterone stimulates the growth of the larynx and thickening and lengthening of the vocal
folds, which causes the voice to drop in pitch. The first fertile ejaculations typically appear at approximately 15 years of
age, but this age can vary widely across individual boys. Unlike the early growth spurt observed in females, the male growth
spurt occurs toward the end of puberty, at approximately age 11 to 13, and a boy’s height can increase as much as 4 inches
a year.
