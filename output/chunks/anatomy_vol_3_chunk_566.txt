Diuretics increase urine volume. Mechanisms for controlling Na* concentration in the blood include
the renin—angiotensin—aldosterone system and ADH. When Na’ is retained, K* is excreted; when Na’ is lost, K’ is retained.

 When circulating Ca** decreases, PTH stimulates the reabsorption of Ca** and inhibits reabsorption of HPO{~ . pH is

regulated through buffers, expiration of COg, and excretion of acid or base by the kidneys. The breakdown of amino acids

produces ammonia. Most ammonia is converted into less-toxic urea in the liver and excreted in the urine. Regulation of
drugs is by glomerular filtration, tubular secretion, and tubular reabsorption.

 25.10 The Urinary System and Homeostasis

The effects of failure of parts of the urinary system may range from inconvenient (incontinence) to fatal (loss of filtration
and many others).
