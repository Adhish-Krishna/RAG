CHAPTER 23| THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 1023

this blood is diverted to the liver where its nutrients are off-loaded for processing before blood completes its circuit back
to the heart. At the same time, the digestive system provides nutrients to the heart muscle and vascular tissue to support
their functioning. The interrelationship of the digestive and endocrine systems is also critical. Hormones secreted by several
endocrine glands, as well as endocrine cells of the pancreas, the stomach, and the small intestine, contribute to the control
of digestion and nutrient metabolism. In turn, the digestive system provides the nutrients to fuel endocrine function. Table
23.1 gives a quick glimpse at how these other systems contribute to the functioning of the digestive system.

 Contribution of Other Body Systems to the Digestive System

Body

Benefits received by the digestive system
system

Cardiovascular | Blood supplies digestive organs with oxygen and processed nutrients

Endocrine Endocrine hormones help regulate secretion in digestive glands and accessory organs

Integumentary | Skin helps protect digestive organs and synthesizes vitamin D for calcium absorption

Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and other lymphatic tissue defend against entry of

Lymphatic pathogens; lacteals absorb lipids; and lymphatic vessels transport lipids to bloodstream
Muscular Skeletal muscles support and protect abdominal organs
Nervous Sensory and motor neurons help regulate secretions and muscle contractions in the digestive

tract

Respiratory Respiratory organs provide oxygen and remove carbon dioxide

Skeletal Bones help protect and support digestive organs

Kidneys convert vitamin D into its active form, allowing calcium absorption in the small

Urinary intestine

Digestive System Organs

The easiest way to understand the digestive system is to divide its organs into two main categories.
