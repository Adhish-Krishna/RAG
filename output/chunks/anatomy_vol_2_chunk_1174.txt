Venous System

The pumping action of the heart propels the blood into the arteries, from an area of higher pressure toward an area of lower
pressure. If blood is to flow from the veins back into the heart, the pressure in the veins must be greater than the pressure
in the atria of the heart. Two factors help maintain this pressure gradient between the veins and the heart. First, the pressure
in the atria during diastole is very low, often approaching zero when the atria are relaxed (atrial diastole). Second, two
physiologic “pumps” increase pressure in the venous system. The use of the term “pump” implies a physical device that
speeds flow. These physiological pumps are less obvious.

 Skeletal Muscle Pump

 In many body regions, the pressure within the veins can be increased by the contraction of the surrounding skeletal muscle.
 This mechanism, known as the skeletal muscle pump (Figure 20.15), helps the lower-pressure veins counteract the force
of gravity, increasing pressure to move blood back to the heart.
