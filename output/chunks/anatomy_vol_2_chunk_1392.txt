Th1 cells are a type of helper T cell that secretes cytokines that regulate the immunological activity and development
of a variety of cells, including macrophages and other types of T cells.

Th2 cells, on the other hand, are cytokine-secreting cells that act on B cells to drive their differentiation into plasma
cells that make antibody. In fact, T cell help is required for antibody responses to most protein antigens, and these are called
T cell-dependent antigens.

 Cytotoxic T cells

Cytotoxic T cells (Tc) are T cells that kill target cells by inducing apoptosis using the same mechanism as NK cells. They
either express Fas ligand, which binds to the fas molecule on the target cell, or act by using perforins and granzymes
contained in their cytoplasmic granules. As was discussed earlier with NK cells, killing a virally infected cell before the
virus can complete its replication cycle results in the production of no infectious particles.
