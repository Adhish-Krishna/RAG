Although it averages approximately five days, the menses phase can last from 2 to 7 days, or longer. As
shown in Figure 27.15, the menses phase occurs during the early days of the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle, when
progesterone, FSH, and LH levels are low. Recall that progesterone concentrations decline as a result of the degradation of
the corpus luteum, marking the end of the luteal phase. This decline in progesterone triggers the shedding of the stratum
functionalis of the endometrium.
