As a result, muscle cells are packed full of mitochondria. Nerve cells also need
large quantities of ATP to run their sodium-potassium pumps. Therefore, an individual neuron will be loaded with over
a thousand mitochondria. On the other hand, a bone cell, which is not nearly as metabolically-active, might only have a
couple hundred mitochondria.

is composed of two separate lipid bilayer membranes. Along the inner membrane are various molecules that work
together to produce ATP, the cell’s major energy currency. (b) An electron micrograph of mitochondria. EM x 236,000.

Peroxisomes

Like lysosomes, a peroxisome is a membrane-bound cellular organelle that contains mostly enzymes (Figure 3.17).
