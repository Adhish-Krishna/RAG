The ependymal cell is a glial cell that filters blood to make cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the fluid that circulates through
the CNS. Because of the privileged blood supply inherent in the BBB, the extracellular space in nervous tissue does not
easily exchange components with the blood. Ependymal cells line each ventricle, one of four central cavities that are
remnants of the hollow center of the neural tube formed during the embryonic development of the brain. The choroid plexus
is a specialized structure in the ventricles where ependymal cells come in contact with blood vessels and filter and absorb
components of the blood to produce cerebrospinal fluid. Because of this, ependymal cells can be considered a component of
the BBB, or a place where the BBB breaks down. These glial cells appear similar to epithelial cells, making a single layer of
cells with little intracellular space and tight connections between adjacent cells. They also have cilia on their apical surface
to help move the CSF through the ventricular space.
