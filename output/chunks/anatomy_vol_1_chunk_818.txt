The greater trochanter can be felt just under the skin on the lateral side of your upper thigh. The
lesser trochanter is a small, bony prominence that lies on the medial aspect of the femur, just below the neck. A single,
powerful muscle attaches to the lesser trochanter. Running between the greater and lesser trochanters on the anterior side of
the femur is the roughened intertrochanteric line. The trochanters are also connected on the posterior side of the femur by
the larger intertrochanteric crest.

 The elongated shaft of the femur has a slight anterior bowing or curvature. At its proximal end, the posterior shaft
has the gluteal tuberosity, a roughened area extending inferiorly from the greater trochanter. More inferiorly, the gluteal
tuberosity becomes continuous with the linea aspera (“rough line”). This is the roughened ridge that passes distally along
the posterior side of the mid-femur. Multiple muscles of the hip and thigh regions make long, thin attachments to the femur
along the linea aspera.
