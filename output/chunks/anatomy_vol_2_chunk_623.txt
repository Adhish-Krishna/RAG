Figure 16.11 Muscles Controlled by the Accessory Nerve The accessory nerve innervates the sternocleidomastoid
and trapezius muscles, both of which attach to the head and to the trunk and shoulders. They can act as antagonists
in head flexion and extension, and as synergists in lateral flexion toward the shoulder.

 To test these muscles, the patient is asked to flex and extend the neck or shrug the shoulders against resistance, testing
the strength of the muscles. Lateral flexion of the neck toward the shoulder tests both at the same time. Any difference
on one side versus the other would suggest damage on the weaker side. These strength tests are common for the skeletal
muscles controlled by spinal nerves and are a significant component of the motor exam. Deficits associated with the
accessory nerve may have an effect on orienting the head, as described with the VOR.

The Pupillary Light Response

The autonomic control of pupillary size in response to a bright light involves the sensory input of the optic nerve
and the parasympathetic motor output of the oculomotor nerve.
