The receptor will process the message by initiating other signaling events or cellular mechanisms that result in
the target cellâ€™s response. Hormone receptors recognize molecules with specific shapes and side groups, and respond only to
those hormones that are recognized. The same type of receptor may be located on cells in different body tissues, and trigger
somewhat different responses. Thus, the response triggered by a hormone depends not only on the hormone, but also on the
target cell.

 Once the target cell receives the hormone signal, it can respond in a variety of ways. The response may include the
stimulation of protein synthesis, activation or deactivation of enzymes, alteration in the permeability of the cell membrane,
altered rates of mitosis and cell growth, and stimulation of the secretion of products. Moreover, a single hormone may be
capable of inducing different responses in a given cell.

 Pathways Involving Intracellular Hormone Receptors

Intracellular hormone receptors are located inside the cell.
