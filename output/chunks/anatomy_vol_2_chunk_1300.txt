The tunica media is a thicker area
composed of variable amounts of smooth muscle and connective tissue. It is the thickest layer in all but the largest arteries.
 The tunica externa is primarily a layer of connective tissue, although in veins, it also contains some smooth muscle. Blood
flow through vessels can be dramatically influenced by vasoconstriction and vasodilation in their walls.

 20.2 Blood Flow, Blood Pressure, and Resistance

Blood flow is the movement of blood through a vessel, tissue, or organ. The slowing or blocking of blood flow is called
resistance. Blood pressure is the force that blood exerts upon the walls of the blood vessels or chambers of the heart. The
components of blood pressure include systolic pressure, which results from ventricular contraction, and diastolic pressure,
which results from ventricular relaxation. Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic measures, and
mean arterial pressure is the “average” pressure of blood in the arterial system, driving blood into the tissues.
