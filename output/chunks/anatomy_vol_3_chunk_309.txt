The pancreas produces the enzyme- and bicarbonate-rich pancreatic juice and delivers it to the small intestine through
ducts. Pancreatic juice buffers the acidic gastric juice in chyme, inactivates pepsin from the stomach, and enables the
optimal functioning of digestive enzymes in the small intestine.

 23.7 Chemical Digestion and Absorption: A Closer Look

The small intestine is the site of most chemical digestion and almost all absorption. Chemical digestion breaks large food
molecules down into their chemical building blocks, which can then be absorbed through the intestinal wall and into the
general circulation. Intestinal brush border enzymes and pancreatic enzymes are responsible for the majority of chemical
digestion. The breakdown of fat also requires bile.

 Most nutrients are absorbed by transport mechanisms at the apical surface of enterocytes. Exceptions include lipids,
â€˜at-soluble vitamins, and most water-soluble vitamins. With the help of bile salts and lecithin, the dietary fats are emulsified
to form micelles, which can carry the fat particles to the surface of the enterocytes.
