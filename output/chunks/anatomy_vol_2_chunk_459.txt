The problem with that usage
is that the cell body is in the ganglion, and only the fiber is postganglionic. Typically, the term neuron applies to the entire
cell.)

 One type of preganglionic sympathetic fiber does not terminate in a ganglion. These are the axons from central
sympathetic neurons that project to the adrenal medulla, the interior portion of the adrenal gland. These axons are still
referred to as preganglionic fibers, but the target is not a ganglion. The adrenal medulla releases signaling molecules into
the bloodstream, rather than using axons to communicate with target structures. The cells in the adrenal medulla that are

contacted by the preganglionic fibers are called chromaffin cells. These cells are neurosecretory cells that develop from the
neural crest along with the sympathetic ganglia, reinforcing the idea that the gland is, functionally, a sympathetic ganglion.
