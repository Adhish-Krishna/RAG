The knee joint is the largest joint of the body. (b)â€”(c) It is supported by the tibial and fibular
collateral ligaments located on the sides of the knee outside of the articular capsule, and the anterior and posterior
cruciate ligaments found inside the capsule. The medial and lateral menisci provide padding and support between the

femoral condyles and tibial condyles.

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/flexext) to learn more about the flexion and extension of the knee, as
the femur both rolls and glides on the tibia to maintain stable contact between the bones in all knee positions. The
patella glides along a groove on the anterior side of the distal femur. The collateral ligaments on the sides of the knee
become tight in the fully extended position to help stabilize the knee. The posterior cruciate ligament supports the
knee when flexed and the anterior cruciate ligament becomes tight when the knee comes into full extension to resist
hyperextension.
