Cardiac muscle undergoes aerobic respiration patterns, primarily metabolizing lipids and carbohydrates. Myoglobin,
lipids, and glycogen are all stored within the cytoplasm. Cardiac muscle cells undergo twitch-type contractions with long
refractory periods followed by brief relaxation periods. The relaxation is essential so the heart can fill with blood for the
next cycle. The refractory period is very long to prevent the possibility of tetany, a condition in which muscle remains
involuntarily contracted. In the heart, tetany is not compatible with life, since it would prevent the heart from pumping
blood.

Repair and Replacement

Damaged cardiac muscle cells have extremely limited abilities to repair themselves or to replace dead cells via
mitosis.
