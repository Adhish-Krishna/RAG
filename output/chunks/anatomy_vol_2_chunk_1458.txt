lymphatic trunks large lymphatics that collect lymph from smaller lymphatic vessels and empties into the blood via
lymphatic ducts

lymph fluid contained within the lymphatic system

lymphocytes white blood cells characterized by a large nucleus and small rim of cytoplasm

lymphoid nodules unencapsulated patches of lymphoid tissue found throughout the body

MHC class II found on macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells, it binds to CD4 molecules on T cells
MHC class | found on most cells of the body, it binds to the CD8 molecule on T cells

MHC polygeny multiple MHC genes and their proteins found in body cells

MHC polymorphism multiple alleles for each individual MHC locus

macrophage oxidative metabolism metabolism turned on in macrophages by T cell signals that help destroy
intracellular bacteria

macrophage ameboid phagocyte found in several tissues throughout the body
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene cluster whose proteins present antigens to T cells

mast cell cell found in the skin and the lining of body cells that contains cytoplasmic granules with vasoactive
mediators such as histamine

memory T cells long-lived immune cell reserved for future exposure to an pathogen

monocyte precursor to macrophages and dendritic cells seen in the blood

mucoSa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoid nodule associated with the mucosa

natural killer cell (NK) cytotoxic lymphocyte of innate immune response

naive lymphocyte mature B or T cell that has not yet encountered antigen for the first time

negative selection selection against thymocytes in the thymus that react with self-antigen

neutralization inactivation of a virus by the binding of specific antibody

neutrophil phagocytic white blood cell recruited from the bloodstream to the site of infection via the bloodstream
opsonization enhancement of phagocytosis by the binding of antibody or antimicrobial protein

passive immunity transfer of immunity to a pathogen to an individual that lacks immunity to this pathogen usually by
the injection of antibodies

pattern recognition receptor (PRR) leukocyte receptor that binds to specific cell wall components of different
bacterial species

perforin molecule in NK cell and cytotoxic T cell granules that form pores in the membrane of a target cell
peripheral tolerance mature B cell made tolerant by lack of T cell help

phagocytosis movement of material from the outside to the inside of the cells via vesicles made from invaginations of
the plasma membrane

plasma cell differentiated B cell that is actively secreting antibody

polyclonal response response by multiple clones to a complex antigen with many determinants

CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM

positive selection selection of thymocytes within the thymus that interact with self, but not non-self, MHC molecules
primary adaptive response immune system’s response to the first exposure to a pathogen

primary lymphoid organ site where lymphocytes mature and proliferate; red bone marrow and thymus gland
psychoneuroimmunology study of the connections between the immune, nervous, and endocrine systems
regulatory T cells (Treg) (also, suppressor T cells) class of CD4 T cells that regulates other T cell responses

right lymphatic duct drains lymph fluid from the upper right side of body into the right subclavian vein

secondary adaptive response immune response observed upon re-exposure to a pathogen, which is stronger and
faster than a primary response

secondary lymphoid organs sites where lymphocytes mount adaptive immune responses; examples include lymph
nodes and spleen

sensitization first exposure to an antigen
seroconversion clearance of pathogen in the serum and the simultaneous rise of serum antibody

severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) genetic mutation that affects both T cell and B cell arms of
the immune response

spleen secondary lymphoid organ that filters pathogens from the blood (white pulp) and removes degenerating or
damaged blood cells (red pulp)

T cell tolerance process during T cell differentiation where most T cells that recognize antigens from one’s own body
are destroyed

T cell-dependent antigen antigen that binds to B cells, which requires signals from T cells to make antibody
T cell-independent antigen binds to B cells, which do not require signals from T cells to make antibody

T cell lymphocyte that acts by secreting molecules that regulate the immune system or by causing the destruction of
foreign cells, viruses, and cancer cells

Th1 cells cells that secrete cytokines that enhance the activity of macrophages and other cells
Th2 cells cells that secrete cytokines that induce B cells to differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells

thoracic duct large duct that drains lymph from the lower limbs, left thorax, left upper limb, and the left side of the
head

thymocyte immature T cell found in the thymus

thymus primary lymphoid organ; where T lymphocytes proliferate and mature

tissue typing typing of MHC molecules between a recipient and donor for use in a potential transplantation procedure
tonsils lymphoid nodules associated with the nasopharynx

type I hypersensitivity immediate response mediated by mast cell degranulation caused by the crosslinking of the
antigen-specific IgE molecules on the mast cell surface

type Il hypersensitivity cell damage caused by the binding of antibody and the activation of complement, usually
against red blood cells

type Ill hypersensitivity damage to tissues caused by the deposition of antibody-antigen (immune) complexes
followed by the activation of complement

variable region domain part of a lymphocyte antigen receptor that varies considerably between different receptor
types

21.1 Anatomy of the Lymphatic and Immune Systems

The lymphatic system is a series of vessels, ducts, and trunks that remove interstitial fluid from the tissues and return it the
blood.
