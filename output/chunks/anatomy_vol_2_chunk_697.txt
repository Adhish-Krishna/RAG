Typically, the original structure
of the amino acid is modified such that aâ€”COOH, or carboxyl, group is removed, whereas the -NH3 , or amine, group

remains.

 Amine hormones are synthesized from the amino acids tryptophan or tyrosine. An example of a hormone derived from
tryptophan is melatonin, which is secreted by the pineal gland and helps regulate circadian rhythm. Tyrosine derivatives
include the metabolism-regulating thyroid hormones, as well as the catecholamines, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine,
and dopamine. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are secreted by the adrenal medulla and play a role in the fight-or-flight
response, whereas dopamine is secreted by the hypothalamus and inhibits the release of certain anterior pituitary hormones.

Peptide and Protein Hormones

 Whereas the amine hormones are derived from a single amino acid, peptide and protein hormones consist of multiple amino
acids that link to form an amino acid chain.
