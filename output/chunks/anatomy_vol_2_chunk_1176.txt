This action forces blood closer to the heart where venous pressure is lower.
 Note the importance of the one-way valves to assure that blood flows only in the proper direction.

 Respiratory Pump

The respiratory pump aids blood flow through the veins of the thorax and abdomen. During inhalation, the volume of the
thorax increases, largely through the contraction of the diaphragm, which moves downward and compresses the abdominal
cavity. The elevation of the chest caused by the contraction of the external intercostal muscles also contributes to the
increased volume of the thorax. The volume increase causes air pressure within the thorax to decrease, allowing us to inhale.
 Additionally, as air pressure within the thorax drops, blood pressure in the thoracic veins also decreases, falling below the
pressure in the abdominal veins. This causes blood to flow along its pressure gradient from veins outside the thorax, where

pressure is higher, into the thoracic region, where pressure is now lower.
