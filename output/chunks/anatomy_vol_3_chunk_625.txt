When Nay HPO comes into contact with

a strong acid, such as HCl, the base picks up a second hydrogen ion to form the weak acid NayH,PO,4~ and sodium

chloride, NaCl. When Na) HPO3~ (the weak acid) comes into contact with a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide

(NaOH), the weak acid reverts back to the weak base and produces water. Acids and bases are still present, but they hold
onto the ions.
 HCl + Na, HPO, > NaH, PO, + NaCl

(strong acid) + (weak base) — (weak acid) + (salt)
NaOH + NaH, PO, > Na,HPO, + H,O

(strong base) + (weak acid) — (weak base) + (water)

Bicarbonate-Carbonic Acid Buffer

The bicarbonate-carbonic acid buffer works in a fashion similar to phosphate buffers.
