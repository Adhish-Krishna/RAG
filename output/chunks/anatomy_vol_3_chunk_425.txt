Acetyl CoA is used to create lipids, triglycerides, steroid
hormones, cholesterol, and bile salts. Lipolysis is the breakdown of triglycerides into glycerol and fatty acids, making them
easier for the body to process.

 24.4 Protein Metabolism

Digestion of proteins begins in the stomach, where HCl and pepsin begin the process of breaking down proteins into their
constituent amino acids. As the chyme enters the small intestine, it mixes with bicarbonate and digestive enzymes. The
bicarbonate neutralizes the acidic HCl, and the digestive enzymes break down the proteins into smaller peptides and amino
acids. Digestive hormones secretin and CCK are released from the small intestine to aid in digestive processes, and digestive
proenzymes are released from the pancreas (trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen). Enterokinase, an enzyme located in the
wall of the small intestine, activates trypsin, which in turn activates chymotrypsin. These enzymes liberate the individual
amino acids that are then transported via sodium-amino acid transporters across the intestinal wall into the cell.
