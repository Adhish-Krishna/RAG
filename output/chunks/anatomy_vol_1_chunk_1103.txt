There are three
types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle. Most of the bodyâ€™s skeletal muscle produces
movement by acting on the skeleton. Cardiac muscle is found in the wall of the heart and pumps blood through the
circulatory system.

 Smooth muscle is found in the skin, where it is associated with hair follicles; it also is found in the walls of internal
organs, blood vessels, and internal passageways, where it assists in moving materials.

10.2 Skeletal Muscle

Skeletal muscles contain connective tissue, blood vessels, and nerves. There are three layers of connective tissue:
epimysium, perimysium, and endomysium. Skeletal muscle fibers are organized into groups called fascicles. Blood vessels
and nerves enter the connective tissue and branch in the cell. Muscles attach to bones directly or through tendons or
aponeuroses. Skeletal muscles maintain posture, stabilize bones and joints, control internal movement, and generate heat.
