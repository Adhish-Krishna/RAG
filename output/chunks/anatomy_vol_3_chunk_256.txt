The teniae coli
are three bands of smooth muscle that make up the longitudinal muscle layer of the muscularis of the large intestine, except
at its terminal end. Tonic contractions of the teniae coli bunch up the colon into a succession of pouches called haustra
(singular = hostrum), which are responsible for the wrinkled appearance of the colon. Attached to the teniae coli are small,
fat-filled sacs of visceral peritoneum called epiploic appendages. The purpose of these is unknown. Although the rectum
and anal canal have neither teniae coli nor haustra, they do have well-developed layers of muscularis that create the strong
contractions needed for defecation.
