When the cornea
is stimulated by a tactile stimulus, or even by bright light in a related reflex, blinking is initiated. The sensory component
travels through the trigeminal nerve, which carries somatosensory information from the face, or through the optic nerve,
if the stimulus is bright light. The motor response travels through the facial nerve and innervates the orbicularis oculi on
the same side. This reflex is commonly tested during a physical exam using an air puff or a gentle touch of a cotton-tipped
applicator.
