On the superior aspect of each kidney is the adrenal gland. The adrenal cortex directly influences renal function through
the production of the hormone aldosterone to stimulate sodium reabsorption.

 Internal Anatomy

A frontal section through the kidney reveals an outer region called the renal cortex and an inner region called the medulla
(Figure 25.8). The renal columns are connective tissue extensions that radiate downward from the cortex through the
medulla to separate the most characteristic features of the medulla, the renal pyramids and renal papillae. The papillae
are bundles of collecting ducts that transport urine made by nephrons to the calyces of the kidney for excretion. The renal

columns also serve to divide the kidney into 6-8 lobes and provide a supportive framework for vessels that enter and exit
the cortex.
