In response to this stimulation from the sensory neuron,
the interneuron then inhibits the motor neuron that controls the triceps brachii. This is done by releasing a neurotransmitter
or other signal that hyperpolarizes the motor neuron connected to the triceps brachii, making it less likely to initiate an
action potential. With this motor neuron being inhibited, the triceps brachii relaxes. Without the antagonistic contraction,
withdrawal from the hot stove is faster and keeps further tissue damage from occurring.

 Another example of a withdrawal reflex occurs when you step on a painful stimulus, like a tack or a sharp rock.
 The nociceptors that are activated by the painful stimulus activate the motor neurons responsible for contraction of the
tibialis anterior muscle. This causes dorsiflexion of the foot. An inhibitory interneuron, activated by a collateral branch of
the nociceptor fiber, will inhibit the motor neurons of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles to cancel plantar flexion.
