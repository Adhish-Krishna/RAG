In response to this pressure change, the flow of blood
temporarily reverses direction through the foramen ovale, moving from the left to the right atrium, and blocking the shunt with
two flaps of tissue. The increased oxygen concentration also constricts the ductus arteriosus, ensuring that these shunts no longer
prevent blood from reaching the lungs to be oxygenated. 41 The newborn’s kidneys are immature and inefficient at concentrating
urine. Therefore, newborns produce very dilute urine—in a sense, wasting fluid. This increases their risk for dehydration, and
makes it critical that caregivers provide newborns with enough fluid, especially during bouts of vomiting or diarrhea. 42 Milk
is secreted by lactocytes into alveoli. Suckling stimulates the contraction of myoepithelial cells that squeeze milk into lactiferous
ducts. It then collects in lactiferous sinuses and is secreted through the nipple pores. 43 It takes time to establish a balance between
milk supply and milk demand. When breastfeeding stops abruptly, it takes time for the supply to fall.
