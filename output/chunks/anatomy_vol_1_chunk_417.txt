They are found throughout the body, but are most abundant in the reticular tissue of
soft organs, such as liver and spleen, where they anchor and provide structural support to the parenchyma (the functional
cells, blood vessels, and nerves of the organ).

 All of these fiber types are embedded in ground substance. Secreted by fibroblasts, ground substance is made of
polysaccharides, specifically hyaluronic acid, and proteins. These combine to form a proteoglycan with a protein core and
polysaccharide branches. The proteoglycan attracts and traps available moisture forming the clear, viscous, colorless matrix
you now know as ground substance.

 Loose Connective Tissue

Loose connective tissue is found between many organs where it acts both to absorb shock and bind tissues together. It allows
water, salts, and various nutrients to diffuse through to adjacent or imbedded cells and tissues.

 Adipose tissue consists mostly of fat storage cells, with little extracellular matrix (Figure 4.13).
