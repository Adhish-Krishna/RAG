Polysaccharides serve as energy storage (e.g., starch and glycogen) and as structural
components (e.g., chitin in insects and cellulose in plants).

 During digestion, carbohydrates are broken down into simple, soluble sugars that can be transported across the
intestinal wall into the circulatory system to be transported throughout the body. Carbohydrate digestion begins in the mouth
with the action of salivary amylase on starches and ends with monosaccharides being absorbed across the epithelium of
the small intestine. Once the absorbed monosaccharides are transported to the tissues, the process of cellular respiration
begins (Figure 24.4). This section will focus first on glycolysis, a process where the monosaccharide glucose is oxidized,
releasing the energy stored in its bonds to produce ATP.
