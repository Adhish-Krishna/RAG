Because they do
not primarily use aerobic metabolism, they do not possess substantial numbers of mitochondria or significant amounts of
myoglobin and therefore have a white color. FG fibers are used to produce rapid, forceful contractions to make quick,
powerful movements. These fibers fatigue quickly, permitting them to only be used for short periods. Most muscles possess
a mixture of each fiber type. The predominant fiber type in a muscle is determined by the primary function of the muscle.


 398 CHAPTER 10 | MUSCLE TISSUE

10.6 | Exercise and Muscle Performance

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe hypertrophy and atrophy
¢ Explain how resistance exercise builds muscle
¢ Explain how performance-enhancing substances affect muscle

Physical training alters the appearance of skeletal muscles and can produce changes in muscle performance. Conversely, a
lack of use can result in decreased performance and muscle appearance. Although muscle cells can change in size, new cells
are not formed when muscles grow.
