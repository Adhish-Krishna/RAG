Compare and contrast growth, differentiation, and reproduction

The different organ systems each have different functions and therefore unique roles to perform in physiology. These many
functions can be summarized in terms of a few that we might consider definitive of human life: organization, metabolism,
responsiveness, movement, development, and reproduction.

 Organization

A human body consists of trillions of cells organized in a way that maintains distinct internal compartments. These
compartments keep body cells separated from external environmental threats and keep the cells moist and nourished. They
also separate internal body fluids from the countless microorganisms that grow on body surfaces, including the lining of
certain tracts, or passageways. The intestinal tract, for example, is home to even more bacteria cells than the total of all
human cells in the body, yet these bacteria are outside the body and cannot be allowed to circulate freely inside the body.
