Figure 2.15 Dissociation of Sodium Chloride in Water Notice that the crystals of sodium chloride dissociate not
into molecules of NaCl, but into Na* cations and CI anions, each completely surrounded by water molecules.

 Many other salts are important in the body. For example, bile salts produced by the liver help break apart dietary fats,
and calcium phosphate salts form the mineral portion of teeth and bones.

 Acids and Bases

Acids and bases, like salts, dissociate in water into electrolytes. Acids and bases can very much change the properties of the
solutions in which they are dissolved.
