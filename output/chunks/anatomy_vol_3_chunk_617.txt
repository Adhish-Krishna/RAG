Phosphate is found

in phospholipids, such as those that make up the cell membrane, and in ATP, nucleotides, and buffers.
 Hypophosphatemia, or abnormally low phosphate blood levels, occurs with heavy use of antacids, during alcohol
withdrawal, and during malnourishment. In the face of phosphate depletion, the kidneys usually conserve phosphate, but
during starvation, this conservation is impaired greatly. Hyperphosphatemia, or abnormally increased levels of phosphates
in the blood, occurs if there is decreased renal function or in cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia. Additionally, because
phosphate is a major constituent of the ICF, any significant destruction of cells can result in dumping of phosphate into the
ECF.

 Regulation of Sodium and Potassium

Sodium is reabsorbed from the renal filtrate, and potassium is excreted into the filtrate in the renal collecting tubule. The
control of this exchange is governed principally by two hormonesâ€”aldosterone and angiotensin II.

 Aldosterone

Recall that aldosterone increases the excretion of potassium and the reabsorption of sodium in the distal tubule.
