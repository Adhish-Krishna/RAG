If a mass is detected, the cancer diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy of
the cells.

 Bulbourethral Glands

The final addition to semen is made by two bulbourethral glands (or Cowperâ€™s glands) that release a thick, salty fluid that
lubricates the end of the urethra and the vagina, and helps to clean urine residues from the penile urethra. The fluid from
these accessory glands is released after the male becomes sexually aroused, and shortly before the release of the semen. It
is therefore sometimes called pre-ejaculate. It is important to note that, in addition to the lubricating proteins, it is possible
for bulbourethral fluid to pick up sperm already present in the urethra, and therefore it may be able to cause pregnancy.
