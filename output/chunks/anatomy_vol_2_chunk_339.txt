Many of the
somatosensory receptors are located in the skin, but receptors are also found in muscles, tendons, joint capsules, ligaments,
and in the walls of visceral organs.

 Two types of somatosensory signals that are transduced by free nerve endings are pain and temperature. These
two modalities use thermoreceptors and nociceptors to transduce temperature and pain stimuli, respectively. Temperature
receptors are stimulated when local temperatures differ from body temperature. Some thermoreceptors are sensitive to just
cold and others to just heat. Nociception is the sensation of potentially damaging stimuli. Mechanical, chemical, or thermal
stimuli beyond a set threshold will elicit painful sensations. Stressed or damaged tissues release chemicals that activate
receptor proteins in the nociceptors. For example, the sensation of heat associated with spicy foods involves capsaicin, the
active molecule in hot peppers. Capsaicin molecules bind to a transmembrane ion channel in nociceptors that is sensitive
to temperatures above 37Â°C.
