The “choices” of base for DNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine.
 Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a ribose-containing nucleotide that helps manifest the genetic code as protein. RNA contains
ribose, one phosphate group, and one nitrogen-containing base, but the “choices” of base for RNA are adenine, cytosine,
guanine, and uracil.

 The nitrogen-containing bases adenine and guanine are classified as purines. A purine is a nitrogen-containing
molecule with a double ring structure, which accommodates several nitrogen atoms. The bases cytosine, thymine (found in
DNA only) and uracil (found in RNA only) are pyramidines. A pyramidine is a nitrogen-containing base with a single ring
structure

Bonds formed by dehydration synthesis between the pentose sugar of one nucleic acid monomer and the phosphate
group of another form a “backbone,” from which the components’ nitrogen-containing bases protrude.
