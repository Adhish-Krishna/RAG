Which functional division of the nervous system would
be responsible for the physiological changes seen during
exercise (e.g., increased heart rate and sweating)?

 a. somatic

b. autonomic

“pops” each time the neuron fires an action potential. These
action potentials are firing so fast that it sounds like static
on the radio. Electrophysiologists can recognize the patterns
within that static to understand what is happening. Why is
the leech model used for measuring the electrical activity of
neurons instead of using humans?

summation) to learn about summation. The process of
converting electrical signals to chemical signals and back
requires subtle changes that can result in transient increases
or decreases in membrane voltage. To cause a lasting change
in the target cell, multiple signals are usually added together,
or summated.
