When light hits the retina, specialized photosensitive
ganglion cells send a signal along the optic nerve to the pretectal nucleus in the superior midbrain. A neuron from this
nucleus projects to the Eddingerâ€”Westphal nuclei in the oculomotor complex in both sides of the midbrain. Neurons
in this nucleus give rise to the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers that project through the oculomotor nerve to the
ciliary ganglion in the posterior orbit. The postganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the ganglion project to the iris,
where they release acetylcholine onto circular fibers that constrict the pupil to reduce the amount of light hitting the
retina. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for dilating the pupil when light levels are low.

 Shining light in one eye will elicit constriction of both pupils. The efferent limb of the pupillary light reflex
is bilateral. Light shined in one eye causes a constriction of that pupil, as well as constriction of the contralateral
pupil. Shining a penlight in the eye of a patient is a very artificial situation, as both eyes are normally exposed to the
same light sources.
