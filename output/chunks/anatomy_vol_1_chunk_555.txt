Examples include the cranial (skull) bones, the scapulae (shoulder blades), the sternum (breastbone), and the ribs. Flat bones
serve as points of attachment for muscles and often protect internal organs.

 Irregular Bones

An irregular bone is one that does not have any easily characterized shape and therefore does not fit any other
classification. These bones tend to have more complex shapes, like the vertebrae that support the spinal cord and protect it
from compressive forces. Many facial bones, particularly the ones containing sinuses, are classified as irregular bones.

 Sesamoid Bones

A sesamoid bone is a small, round bone that, as the name suggests, is shaped like a sesame seed. These bones form
in tendons (the sheaths of tissue that connect bones to muscles) where a great deal of pressure is generated in a joint.
 The sesamoid bones protect tendons by helping them overcome compressive forces. Sesamoid bones vary in number and
placement from person to person but are typically found in tendons associated with the feet, hands, and knees.
