You might envision being inside a miniature boat, exploring the various branches of the circulatory
system. This simple approach has proven effective for many students in mastering these major circulatory patterns. Another
approach that works well for many students is to create simple line drawings similar to the ones provided, labeling each of
the major vessels. It is beyond the scope of this text to name every vessel in the body. However, we will attempt to discuss
the major pathways for blood and acquaint you with the major named arteries and veins in the body. Also, please keep in
mind that individual variations in circulation patterns are not uncommon.

 Pulmonary Circulation

Recall that blood returning from the systemic circuit enters the right atrium (Figure 20.23) via the superior and inferior
venae cavae and the coronary sinus, which drains the blood supply of the heart muscle.
