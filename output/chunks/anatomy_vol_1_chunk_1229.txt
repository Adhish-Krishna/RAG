Tongue muscles are both extrinsic and intrinsic. The
genioglossus depresses the tongue and moves it anteriorly; the styloglossus lifts the tongue and retracts it; the palatoglossus
elevates the back of the tongue; and the hyoglossus depresses and flattens it. The muscles of the anterior neck facilitate
swallowing and speech, stabilize the hyoid bone and position the larynx. The muscles of the neck stabilize and move the
head. The sternocleidomastoid divides the neck into anterior and posterior triangles.

 The muscles of the back and neck that move the vertebral column are complex, overlapping, and can be divided
into five groups. The splenius group includes the splenius capitis and the splenius cervicis. The erector spinae has three
subgroups. The iliocostalis group includes the iliocostalis cervicis, the iliocostalis thoracis, and the iliocostalis lumborum.
 The longissimus group includes the longissimus capitis, the longissimus cervicis, and the longissimus thoracis. The spinalis
group includes the spinalis capitis, the spinalis cervicis, and the spinalis thoracis.
