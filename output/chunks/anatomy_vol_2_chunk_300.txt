This example also includes sensory input (the retinal
projection to the thalamus), central processing (the thalamus and subsequent cortical activity), and motor output (activation
of neurons in the brain stem that lead to coordinated contraction of extraocular muscles).

 14.1 | Sensory Perception

 By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Describe different types of sensory receptors
¢ Describe the structures responsible for the special senses of taste, smell, hearing, balance, and vision
 ¢ Distinguish how different tastes are transduced
 ¢ Describe the means of mechanoreception for hearing and balance
¢ List the supporting structures around the eye and describe the structure of the eyeball
* Describe the processes of phototransduction

A major role of sensory receptors is to help us learn about the environment around us, or about the state of our internal
environment. Stimuli from varying sources, and of different types, are received and changed into the electrochemical signals
of the nervous system.
