The initiation of ovulation—the release of an oocyte from the ovary—marks the transition from puberty into
reproductive maturity for women. From then on, throughout a woman’s reproductive years, ovulation occurs approximately
once every 28 days. Just prior to ovulation, a surge of luteinizing hormone triggers the resumption of meiosis in a primary
oocyte. This initiates the transition from primary to secondary oocyte. However, as you can see in Figure 27.11, this cell
division does not result in two identical cells. Instead, the cytoplasm is divided unequally, and one daughter cell is much
larger than the other. This larger cell, the secondary oocyte, eventually leaves the ovary during ovulation. The smaller cell,
called the first polar body, may or may not complete meiosis and produce second polar bodies; in either case, it eventually
disintegrates. Therefore, even though oogenesis produces up to four cells, only one survives.
