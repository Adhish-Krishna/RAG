The sum of the
partial pressures of all the gases in a mixture equals the total pressure.

 Partial pressure is extremely important in predicting the movement of gases. Recall that gases tend to equalize their
pressure in two regions that are connected. A gas will move from an area where its partial pressure is higher to an area
where its partial pressure is lower. In addition, the greater the partial pressure difference between the two areas, the more
rapid is the movement of gases.

 Solubility of Gases in Liquids

Henry’s law describes the behavior of gases when they come into contact with a liquid, such as blood. Henry’s law states
that the concentration of gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the solubility and partial pressure of that gas. The greater
the partial pressure of the gas, the greater the number of gas molecules that will dissolve in the liquid. The concentration
of the gas in a liquid is also dependent on the solubility of the gas in the liquid.
