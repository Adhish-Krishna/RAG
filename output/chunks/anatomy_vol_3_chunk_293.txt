Once inside
the cell, they are packaged for transport via the base of the cell and then enter the lacteals of the villi to be transported by
lymphatic vessels to the systemic circulation via the thoracic duct. The absorption of most nutrients through the mucosa o
the intestinal villi requires active transport fueled by ATP. The routes of absorption for each food category are summarized
in Table 23.10.
