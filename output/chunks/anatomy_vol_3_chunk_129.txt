From a functional perspective, the respiratory system can be divided into two major areas:
the conducting zone and the respiratory zone. The conducting zone consists of all of the structures that provide passageways
or air to travel into and out of the lungs: the nasal cavity, pharynx, trachea, bronchi, and most bronchioles. The nasal
passages contain the conchae and meatuses that expand the surface area of the cavity, which helps to warm and humidify
incoming air, while removing debris and pathogens. The pharynx is composed of three major sections: the nasopharynx,
which is continuous with the nasal cavity; the oropharynx, which borders the nasopharynx and the oral cavity; and the
aryngopharynx, which borders the oropharynx, trachea, and esophagus. The respiratory zone includes the structures of the
ung that are directly involved in gas exchange: the terminal bronchioles and alveoli.

 The lining of the conducting zone is composed mostly of pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium with goblet
cells.
