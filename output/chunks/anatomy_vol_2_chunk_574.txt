Memory is largely a function of the temporal lobe, along with structures beneath the cerebral cortex such as the
hippocampus and the amygdala. The storage of memory requires these structures of the medial temporal lobe. A famous
case of a man who had both medial temporal lobes removed to treat intractable epilepsy provided insight into the
relationship between the structures of the brain and the function of memory.

 Henry Molaison, who was referred to as patient HM when he was alive, had epilepsy localized to both of his medial
temporal lobes. In 1953, a bilateral lobectomy was performed that alleviated the epilepsy but resulted in the inability for
HM to form new memoriesâ€”a condition called anterograde amnesia. HM was able to recall most events from before his
surgery, although there was a partial loss of earlier memories, which is referred to as retrograde amnesia. HM became the
subject of extensive studies into how memory works. What he was unable to do was form new memories of what happened
to him, what are now called episodic memory.
