CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 655

©- Interactive |LINK

Read this article (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/3word) to learn about a young man who texts his fiancée in a panic
as he finds that he is having trouble remembering things. At the hospital, a neurologist administers the mental status
exam, which is mostly normal except for the three-word recall test. The young man could not recall them even 30
seconds after hearing them and repeating them back to the doctor. An undiscovered mass in the mediastinum region
was found to be Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the immune system and likely caused antibodies to
attack the nervous system. The patient eventually regained his ability to remember, though the events in the hospital
were always elusive. Considering that the effects on memory were temporary, but resulted in the loss of the specific
events of the hospital stay, what regions of the brain were likely to have been affected by the antibodies and what type
of memory does that represent?
