In the long-term stress response, the hormone cortisol is involved in catabolism of glycogen stores,
proteins, and triglycerides, glucose and ketone synthesis, and downregulation of the immune system. 52 SAD is thought to occur
in part because low levels and duration of sunlight allow excessive and prolonged secretion of melatonin. Light therapy—daytime
exposure to very bright lighting—is one common therapy. 53 The retina is important for melatonin production because it senses
light. Bright light inhibits the production of melatonin, whereas low light levels promote the production of melatonin. Therefore,
deterioration of the retinas would most likely disturb the sleep-wake pattern because melatonin production would be elevated. 54
Both estrogens and progesterone are steroid hormones produced by the ovaries that help regulate the menstrual cycle. Estrogens
play an important role in the development of the female reproductive tract and secondary sex characteristics. They also help
maintain pregnancy. Progesterone prepares the body for pregnancy and helps maintain pregnancy. 55 Relaxin produced by the
placenta is thought to soften and widen the pubic symphysis.
