Multiaxial plane joints
provide for only small motions, but these can add together over several adjacent joints to produce body movement, such
as inversion and eversion of the foot. Similarly, plane joints allow for flexion, extension, and lateral flexion movements
of the vertebral column. The multiaxial ball and socket joints allow for flexion-extension, abduction-adduction, and
circumduction. In addition, these also allow for medial (internal) and lateral (external) rotation. Ball-and-socket joints have
the greatest range of motion of all synovial joints.
