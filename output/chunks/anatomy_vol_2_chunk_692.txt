Some patients experience health problems as a result of the normal decline in hormones that can accompany
aging. These patients can consult with an endocrinologist to weigh the risks and benefits of hormone replacement
therapy intended to boost their natural levels of reproductive hormones.

 In addition to treating patients, endocrinologists may be involved in research to improve the understanding of
endocrine system disorders and develop new treatments for these diseases.

 17.2 | Hormones

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Identify the three major classes of hormones on the basis of chemical structure
¢ Compare and contrast intracellular and cell membrane hormone receptors
* Describe signaling pathways that involve cAMP and IP3
¢ Identify several factors that influence a target cell’s response
* Discuss the role of feedback loops and humoral, hormonal, and neural stimuli in hormone control

Although a given hormone may travel throughout the body in the bloodstream, it will affect the activity only of its
target cells; that is, cells with receptors for that particular hormone.
