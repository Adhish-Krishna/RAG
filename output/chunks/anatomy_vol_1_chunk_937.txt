The paired superior articular
processes of the axis articulate with the inferior articular processes of the atlas. These articulating surfaces are relatively
flat and oriented horizontally. The third articulation is the pivot joint formed between the dens, which projects upward from
the body of the axis, and the inner aspect of the anterior arch of the atlas (Figure 9.14). A strong ligament passes posterior
to the dens to hold it in position against the anterior arch. These articulations allow the atlas to rotate on top of the axis,
moving the head toward the right or left, as when shaking your head “no.”

Figure 9.14 Atlantoaxial Joint The atlantoaxial joint is a pivot type of joint between the dens portion of the axis (C2
vertebra) and the anterior arch of the atlas (C1 vertebra), with the dens held in place by a ligament.
