48 Carbon dioxide can be transported by three mechanisms: dissolved in plasma, as bicarbonate, or as
carbaminohemoglobin. Dissolved in plasma, carbon dioxide molecules simply diffuse into the blood from the tissues. Bicarbonate
is created by a chemical reaction that occurs mostly in erythrocytes, joining carbon dioxide and water by carbonic anhydrase,
producing carbonic acid, which breaks down into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. Carbaminohemoglobin is the bound form of
hemoglobin and carbon dioxide. 49 There are three neural factors that play a role in the increased ventilation observed during
exercise. Because this increased ventilation occurs at the beginning of exercise, it is unlikely that only blood oxygen and carbon
dioxide levels are involved. The first neural factor is the psychological stimulus of making a conscious decision to exercise. The
second neural factor is the stimulus of motor neuron activation by the skeletal muscles, which are involved in exercise. The third
neural factor is activation of the proprioceptors located in the muscles, joints, and tendons that stimulate activity in the respiratory
centers.
