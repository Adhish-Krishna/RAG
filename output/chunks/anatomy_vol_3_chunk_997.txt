A stroke in the temporal lobe can result
in specific sensory deficits in these systems (known as agnosias) or losses in memory. 36 A copy of descending input from the
cerebrum to the spinal cord, through the pons, and sensory feedback from the spinal cord and special senses like balance, through
the medulla, both go to the cerebellum. It can therefore send output through the midbrain that will correct spinal cord control of
skeletal muscle movements. 37 The structure is a circular connection of blood vessels, so that blood coming up from one of the
arteries can flow in either direction around the circle and avoid any blockage or narrowing of the blood vessels. 38 The nerves
that connect the periphery to the CNS pass through these layers of tissue and can be damaged by that inflammation, causing a loss
of important neurological functions. 39 The peripheral nervous tissues are out in the body, sometimes part of other organ systems.
