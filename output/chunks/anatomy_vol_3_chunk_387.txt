Metabolism: Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiency and
Phenylketonuria

Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency (PDCD) and phenylketonuria (PKU) are genetic disorders. Pyruvate
dehydrogenase is the enzyme that converts pyruvate into acetyl CoA, the molecule necessary to begin the Krebs cycle
to produce ATP. With low levels of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), the rate of cycling through the Krebs
cycle is dramatically reduced. This results in a decrease in the total amount of energy that is produced by the cells of the
body. PDC deficiency results in a neurodegenerative disease that ranges in severity, depending on the levels of the PDC
enzyme. It may cause developmental defects, muscle spasms, and death. Treatments can include diet modification,
vitamin supplementation, and gene therapy; however, damage to the central nervous system usually cannot be reversed.

 PKU affects about 1 in every 15,000 births in the United States. People afflicted with PKU lack sufficient
activity of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase and are therefore unable to break down phenylalanine into tyrosine
adequately.
