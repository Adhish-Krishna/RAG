This allows a feather to be picked up using
the biceps brachii arm muscle with minimal force, and a heavy weight to be lifted by the same muscle by recruiting the
largest motor units.

 When necessary, the maximal number of motor units in a muscle can be recruited simultaneously, producing the
maximum force of contraction for that muscle, but this cannot last for very long because of the energy requirements to
sustain the contraction. To prevent complete muscle fatigue, motor units are generally not all simultaneously active, but
instead some motor units rest while others are active, which allows for longer muscle contractions. The nervous system uses
recruitment as a mechanism to efficiently utilize a skeletal muscle.

 The Length-Tension Range of a Sarcomere

When a skeletal muscle fiber contracts, myosin heads attach to actin to form cross-bridges followed by the thin filaments
sliding over the thick filaments as the heads pull the actin, and this results in sarcomere shortening, creating the tension of
the muscle contraction.
