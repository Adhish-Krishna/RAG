¢ Explain the purpose and the process of lipogenesis

Fats (or triglycerides) within the body are ingested as food or synthesized by adipocytes or hepatocytes from carbohydrate
precursors (Figure 24.11). Lipid metabolism entails the oxidation of fatty acids to either generate energy or synthesize new
lipids from smaller constituent molecules. Lipid metabolism is associated with carbohydrate metabolism, as products of
glucose (such as acetyl CoA) can be converted into lipids.
