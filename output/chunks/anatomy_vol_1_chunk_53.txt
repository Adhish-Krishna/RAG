Consciously,
of course, you contract your skeletal muscles to move the bones of your skeleton to get from one place to another (as the
runners are doing in Figure 1.7), and to carry out all of the activities of your daily life.

CHAPTER 1] AN INTRODUCTION TO THE HUMAN BODY 23

Figure 1.7 Marathon Runners Runners demonstrate two characteristics of living humans—responsiveness and
movement. Anatomic structures and physiological processes allow runners to coordinate the action of muscle groups
and sweat in response to rising internal body temperature. (credit: Phil Roeder/flickr)

 Development

Development is all of the changes the body goes through in life. Development includes the processes of differentiation,
growth, and renewal.

 Differentiation is the process whereby unspecialized cells become specialized in both structure and function. After
conception, when a female’s egg cell is fertilized by a male’s sperm cell, the fertilized egg begins to multiply, initially into
a cluster of identical unspecialized cells.
