Frequencies in the higher ranges of 20 KHz are encoded by hair cells at the base of the cochlea, close to the
round and oval windows (Figure 14.10). Most auditory stimuli contain a mixture of sounds at a variety of frequencies and
intensities (represented by the amplitude of the sound wave). The hair cells along the length of the cochlear duct, which are
each sensitive to a particular frequency, allow the cochlea to separate auditory stimuli by frequency, just as a prism separates
visible light into its component colors.
