The femoral head fuses between the ages of 14â€”-17 years,
whereas the distal condyles of the femur are the last to fuse, between the ages of 16-19 years. Knowledge of the age at
which different epiphyseal plates disappear is important when interpreting radiographs taken of children. Since the cartilage
of an epiphyseal plate is less dense than bone, the plate will appear dark in a radiograph image. Thus, a normal epiphyseal
plate may be mistaken for a bone fracture.

 The clavicle is the one appendicular skeleton bone that does not develop via endochondral ossification. Instead, the
clavicle develops through the process of intramembranous ossification. During this process, mesenchymal cells differentiate
