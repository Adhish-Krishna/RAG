Superior rotation of the scapula is thus required for full
abduction of the upper limb. Superior rotation is also used without arm abduction when carrying a heavy load with your
hand or on your shoulder. You can feel this rotation when you pick up a load, such as a heavy book bag and carry it on only
one shoulder. To increase its weight-bearing support for the bag, the shoulder lifts as the scapula superiorly rotates. Inferior
rotation occurs during limb adduction and involves the downward motion of the glenoid cavity with upward movement of
the medial end of the scapular spine.

 Opposition and Reposition

Opposition is the thumb movement that brings the tip of the thumb in contact with the tip of a finger. This movement
is produced at the first carpometacarpal joint, which is a saddle joint formed between the trapezium carpal bone and the
first metacarpal bone. Thumb opposition is produced by a combination of flexion and abduction of the thumb at this joint.
