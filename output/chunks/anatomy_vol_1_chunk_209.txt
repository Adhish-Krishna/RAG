Finally, trans fatty acids found in some processed foods, including some stick and tub margarines, are thought to be
even more harmful to the heart and blood vessels than saturated fatty acids. Trans fats are created from unsaturated fatty
acids (such as corn oil) when chemically treated to produce partially hydrogenated fats.

 As a group, triglycerides are a major fuel source for the body. When you are resting or asleep, a majority of the energy
used to keep you alive is derived from triglycerides stored in your fat (adipose) tissues. Triglycerides also fuel long, slow
physical activity such as gardening or hiking, and contribute a modest percentage of energy for vigorous physical activity.
 Dietary fat also assists the absorption and transport of the nonpolar fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Additionally, stored
body fat protects and cushions the bodyâ€™s bones and internal organs, and acts as insulation to retain body heat.

Fatty acids are also components of glycolipids, which are sugar-fat compounds found in the cell membrane.
