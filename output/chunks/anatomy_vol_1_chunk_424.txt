In all cases,
overuse of the joint causes a microtrauma that initiates the inflammatory response. Tendinitis is routinely diagnosed
through a clinical examination. In case of severe pain, X-rays can be examined to rule out the possibility of a bone
injury. Severe cases of tendinitis can even tear loose a tendon. Surgical repair of a tendon is painful. Connective tissue
in the tendon does not have abundant blood supply and heals slowly.

 While older adults are at risk for tendinitis because the elasticity of tendon tissue decreases with age, active people
of all ages can develop tendinitis. Young athletes, dancers, and computer operators; anyone who performs the same
movements constantly is at risk for tendinitis. Although repetitive motions are unavoidable in many activities and
may lead to tendinitis, precautions can be taken that can lessen the probability of developing tendinitis. For active
individuals, stretches before exercising and cross training or changing exercises are recommended. For the passionate
athlete, it may be time to take some lessons to improve technique.
