Connective Tissue: Tendinitis

Your opponent stands ready as you prepare to hit the serve, but you are confident that you will smash the ball past your
opponent. As you toss the ball high in the air, a burning pain shoots across your wrist and you drop the tennis racket.
 That dull ache in the wrist that you ignored through the summer is now an unbearable pain. The game is over for now.

 After examining your swollen wrist, the doctor in the emergency room announces that you have developed wrist
tendinitis. She recommends icing the tender area, taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication to ease the pain
and to reduce swelling, and complete rest for a few weeks.
