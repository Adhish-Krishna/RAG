This response is called wave
summation, because the excitation-contraction coupling effects of successive motor neuron signaling is summed, or added
together (Figure 10.16a). At the molecular level, summation occurs because the second stimulus triggers the release of

more Ca** ions, which become available to activate additional sarcomeres while the muscle is still contracting from the
first stimulus. Summation results in greater contraction of the motor unit.
