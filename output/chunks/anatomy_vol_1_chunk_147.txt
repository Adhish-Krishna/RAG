These are ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and hydrogen bonds.

lons and lonic Bonds

Recall that an atom typically has the same number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons. As long
as this situation remains, the atom is electrically neutral. But when an atom participates in a chemical reaction that results
in the donation or acceptance of one or more electrons, the atom will then become positively or negatively charged. This
happens frequently for most atoms in order to have a full valence shell, as described previously. This can happen either
by gaining electrons to fill a shell that is more than half-full, or by giving away electrons to empty a shell than is less
than half-full, thereby leaving the next smaller electron shell as the new, full, valence shell.
