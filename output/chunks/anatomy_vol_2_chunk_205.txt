As shown in this video, the indirect
pathway is the longer pathway through the system that results in decreased activity in the cerebral cortex, and therefore
less motor activity. The indirect pathway has an extra couple of connections in it, including disinhibition of the
subthalamic nucleus. What is the end result on the thalamus, and therefore on movement initiated by the cerebral
cortex?

The Myth of Left Brain/Right Brain

There is a persistent myth that people are “right-brained” or “left-brained,” which is an oversimplification of an
important concept about the cerebral hemispheres. There is some lateralization of function, in which the left side of
the brain is devoted to language function and the right side is devoted to spatial and nonverbal reasoning. Whereas
these functions are predominantly associated with those sides of the brain, there is no monopoly by either side on these
functions.
