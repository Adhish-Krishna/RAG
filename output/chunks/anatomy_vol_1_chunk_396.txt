Cell
shapes can be squamous (flattened and thin), cuboidal (boxy, as wide as it is tall), or columnar (rectangular, taller than it is
wide). Similarly, the number of cell layers in the tissue can be one—where every cell rests on the basal lamina—which is
a simple epithelium, or more than one, which is a stratified epithelium and only the basal layer of cells rests on the basal
lamina. Pseudostratified (pseudo- = “false”) describes tissue with a single layer of irregularly shaped cells that give the
appearance of more than one layer. Transitional describes a form of specialized stratified epithelium in which the shape of
the cells can vary.

Figure 4.6 Cells of Epithelial Tissue Simple epithelial tissue is organized as a single layer of cells and stratified
epithelial tissue is formed by several layers of cells.
