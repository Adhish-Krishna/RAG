That neuron sends a signal along its axon to excite the biceps brachii, causing
contraction of the muscle and flexion of the forearm at the elbow to withdraw the hand from the hot stove. The withdrawal
reflex has more components, such as inhibiting the opposing muscle and balancing posture while the arm is forcefully
withdrawn, which will be further explored at the end of this chapter.

 The basic withdrawal reflex explained above includes sensory input (the painful stimulus), central processing (the
synapse in the spinal cord), and motor output (activation of a ventral motor neuron that causes contraction of the biceps
brachii). Expanding the explanation of the withdrawal reflex can include inhibition of the opposing muscle, or cross
extension, either of which increase the complexity of the example by involving more central neurons. A collateral branch
of the sensory axon would inhibit another ventral horn motor neuron so that the triceps brachii do not contract and slow the
withdrawal down.
