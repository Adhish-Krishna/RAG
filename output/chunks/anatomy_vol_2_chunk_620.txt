There are two sets of muscles of the tongue. The extrinsic muscles of the tongue
are connected to other structures, whereas the intrinsic muscles of the tongue are completely contained within the lingual
tissues. While examining the oral cavity, movement of the tongue will indicate whether hypoglossal function is impaired.
 The test for hypoglossal function is the “stick out your tongue” part of the exam. The genioglossus muscle is responsible
for protrusion of the tongue. If the hypoglossal nerves on both sides are working properly, then the tongue will stick straight
out. If the nerve on one side has a deficit, the tongue will stick out to that side—pointing to the side with damage. Loss
of function of the tongue can interfere with speech and swallowing. Additionally, because the location of the hypoglossal
nerve and nucleus is near the cardiovascular center, inspiratory and expiratory areas for respiration, and the vagus nuclei
that regulate digestive functions, a tongue that protrudes incorrectly can suggest damage in adjacent structures that have
nothing to do with controlling the tongue.
