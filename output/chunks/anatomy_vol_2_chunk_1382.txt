In the cortex of the
thymus, they are exposed to cortical epithelial cells. In a process known as positive selection, double-negative thymocytes
bind to the MHC molecules they observe on the thymic epithelia, and the MHC molecules of “self” are selected. This
mechanism kills many thymocytes during T cell differentiation. In fact, only two percent of the thymocytes that enter the
thymus leave it as mature, functional T cells.
