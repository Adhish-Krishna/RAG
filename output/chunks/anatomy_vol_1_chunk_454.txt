In this case, the cell becomes part of the secretion.

4.3 Connective Tissue Supports and Protects

Connective tissue is a heterogeneous tissue with many cell shapes and tissue architecture. Structurally, all connective tissues
contain cells that are embedded in an extracellular matrix stabilized by proteins. The chemical nature and physical layout
of the extracellular matrix and proteins vary enormously among tissues, reflecting the variety of functions that connective
tissue fulfills in the body. Connective tissues separate and cushion organs, protecting them from shifting or traumatic injury.
 Connect tissues provide support and assist movement, store and transport energy molecules, protect against infections, and
contribute to temperature homeostasis.

 Many different cells contribute to the formation of connective tissues. They originate in the mesodermal germ layer
and differentiate from mesenchyme and hematopoietic tissue in the bone marrow. Fibroblasts are the most abundant and
secrete many protein fibers, adipocytes specialize in fat storage, hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow give rise to all
the blood cells, chondrocytes form cartilage, and osteocytes form bone.
