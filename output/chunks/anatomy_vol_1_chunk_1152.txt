Muscles involved in chewing must be able to exert enough
pressure to bite through and then chew food before it is swallowed (Figure 11.10 and Table 11.4). The masseter muscle is
the main muscle used for chewing because it elevates the mandible (lower jaw) to close the mouth, and it is assisted by the
temporalis muscle, which retracts the mandible. You can feel the temporalis move by putting your fingers to your temple

as you chew.

Figure 11.10 Muscles That Move the Lower Jaw The muscles that move the lower jaw are typically located within
the cheek and originate from processes in the skull. This provides the jaw muscles with the large amount of leverage

needed for chewing.
