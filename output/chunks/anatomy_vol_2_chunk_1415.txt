Ideally, the immune response

will rid the body of a pathogen entirely. The adaptive immune response, with its rapid clonal expansion, is well suited to
this purpose. Think of a primary infection as a race between the pathogen and the immune system. The pathogen bypasses
barrier defenses and starts multiplying in the host’s body. During the first 4 to 5 days, the innate immune response will
partially control, but not stop, pathogen growth. As the adaptive immune response gears up, however, it will begin to clear
the pathogen from the body, while at the same time becoming stronger and stronger. When following antibody responses
in patients with a particular disease such as a virus, this clearance is referred to as seroconversion (sero- = “serum”).
 Seroconversion is the reciprocal relationship between virus levels in the blood and antibody levels. As the antibody levels
rise, the virus levels decline, and this is a sign that the immune response is being at least partially effective (partially, because
in many diseases, seroconversion does not necessarily mean a patient is getting well).
