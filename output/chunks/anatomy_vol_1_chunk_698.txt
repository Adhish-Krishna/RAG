The transverse and spinous processes serve as important muscle attachment sites. A superior articular process
extends or faces upward, and an inferior articular process faces or projects downward on each side of a vertebrae. The
paired superior articular processes of one vertebra join with the corresponding paired inferior articular processes from

the next higher vertebra. These junctions form slightly moveable joints between the adjacent vertebrae. The shape and
orientation of the articular processes vary in different regions of the vertebral column and play a major role in determining
the type and range of motion available in each region.
