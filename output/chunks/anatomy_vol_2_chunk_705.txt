Â® cAMP activates protein
kinases.

 (6) Protein kinases phosphorylate
proteins in the cytoplasm.
 This activates these proteins,
allowing them to alter

cell activity.

 Figure 17.5 Binding of Water-Soluble Hormones Water-soluble hormones cannot diffuse through the cell
membrane. These hormones must bind to a surface cell-membrane receptor. The receptor then initiates a cell-
signaling pathway within the cell involving G proteins, adenylyl cyclase, the secondary messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP),
and protein kinases. In the final step, these protein kinases phosphorylate proteins in the cytoplasm. This activates
proteins in the cell that carry out the changes specified by the hormone.

 The phosphorylation of cellular proteins can trigger a wide variety of effects, from nutrient metabolism to the synthesis
of different hormones and other products. The effects vary according to the type of target cell, the G proteins and kinases
involved, and the phosphorylation of proteins.
