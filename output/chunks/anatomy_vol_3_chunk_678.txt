From here, the ductus deferens continues posteriorly to the pelvic cavity, ending posterior to the
bladder where it dilates in a region called the ampulla (meaning “flask”).

 Sperm make up only 5 percent of the final volume of semen, the thick, milky fluid that the male ejaculates. The bulk
of semen is produced by three critical accessory glands of the male reproductive system: the seminal vesicles, the prostate,
and the bulbourethral glands.

 Seminal Vesicles

As sperm pass through the ampulla of the ductus deferens at ejaculation, they mix with fluid from the associated seminal
vesicle (see Figure 27.2). The paired seminal vesicles are glands that contribute approximately 60 percent of the semen
volume. Seminal vesicle fluid contains large amounts of fructose, which is used by the sperm mitochondria to generate ATP
to allow movement through the female reproductive tract.

 The fluid, now containing both sperm and seminal vesicle secretions, next moves into the associated ejaculatory duct,
a short structure formed from the ampulla of the ductus deferens and the duct of the seminal vesicle.
