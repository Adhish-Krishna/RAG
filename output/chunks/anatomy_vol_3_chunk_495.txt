Explain why the differential permeability or impermeability of specific sections of the nephron tubules is necessary
or urine formation

 ¢ Describe how and where water, organic compounds, and ions are reabsorbed in the nephron

¢ Explain the role of the loop of Henle, the vasa recta, and the countercurrent multiplication mechanisms in the
concentration of urine

¢ List the locations in the nephron where tubular secretion occurs

With up to 180 liters per day passing through the nephrons of the kidney, it is quite obvious that most of that fluid and its
contents must be reabsorbed. That recovery occurs in the PCT, loop of Henle, DCT, and the collecting ducts (Table 25.5 and
Figure 25.17). Various portions of the nephron differ in their capacity to reabsorb water and specific solutes. While much
of the reabsorption and secretion occur passively based on concentration gradients, the amount of water that is reabsorbed
or lost is tightly regulated.
