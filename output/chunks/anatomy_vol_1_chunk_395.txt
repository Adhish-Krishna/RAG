While similar in appearance to desmosomes, they
include the adhesion proteins called integrins rather than cadherins. Adherens junctions use either cadherins or integrins
depending on whether they are linking to other cells or matrix. The junctions are characterized by the presence of the
contractile protein actin located on the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane. The actin can connect isolated patches or
form a belt-like structure inside the cell. These junctions influence the shape and folding of the epithelial tissue.

 In contrast with the tight and anchoring junctions, a gap junction forms an intercellular passageway between the
membranes of adjacent cells to facilitate the movement of small molecules and ions between the cytoplasm of adjacent
cells. These junctions allow electrical and metabolic coupling of adjacent cells, which coordinates function in large groups
of cells.

 Classification of Epithelial Tissues

Epithelial tissues are classified according to the shape of the cells and number of the cell layers formed (Figure 4.6).
