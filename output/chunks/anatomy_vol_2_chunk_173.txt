As the two sides of the neural groove converge, they form the neural tube, which lies beneath the
ectoderm. The anterior end of the neural tube will develop into the brain, and the posterior portion will become the
spinal cord. The neural crest develops into peripheral structures.

 At this point, the early nervous system is a simple, hollow tube. It runs from the anterior end of the embryo to the
posterior end. Beginning at 25 days, the anterior end develops into the brain, and the posterior portion becomes the spinal
cord. This is the most basic arrangement of tissue in the nervous system, and it gives rise to the more complex structures by
the fourth week of development.

 Primary Vesicles

As the anterior end of the neural tube starts to develop into the brain, it undergoes a couple of enlargements; the result is the
production of sac-like vesicles.
