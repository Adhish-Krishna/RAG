Once pinched off, the portion of membrane and its contents becomes an independent,
intracellular vesicle. A vesicle is a membranous sac—a spherical and hollow organelle bounded by a lipid bilayer
membrane. Endocytosis often brings materials into the cell that must to be broken down or digested. Phagocytosis (“cell
eating”) is the endocytosis of large particles. Many immune cells engage in phagocytosis of invading pathogens. Like little
Pac-men, their job is to patrol body tissues for unwanted matter, such as invading bacterial cells, phagocytize them, and
digest them. In contrast to phagocytosis, pinocytosis (“cell drinking”) brings fluid containing dissolved substances into a
cell through membrane vesicles.

extracellular materials using its cell membrane.
