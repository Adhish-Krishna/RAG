Explain the arrangement of gray and white matter in the spinal cord

The brain and the spinal cord are the central nervous system, and they represent the main organs of the nervous system.
 The spinal cord is a single structure, whereas the adult brain is described in terms of four major regions: the cerebrum,
the diencephalon, the brain stem, and the cerebellum. A personâ€™s conscious experiences are based on neural activity in the
brain. The regulation of homeostasis is governed by a specialized region in the brain. The coordination of reflexes depends
on the integration of sensory and motor pathways in the spinal cord.

 The Cerebrum

The iconic gray mantle of the human brain, which appears to make up most of the mass of the brain, is the cerebrum
(Figure 13.6). The wrinkled portion is the cerebral cortex, and the rest of the structure is beneath that outer covering.
 There is a large separation between the two sides of the cerebrum called the longitudinal fissure.
