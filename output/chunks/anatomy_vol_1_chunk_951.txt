A
common injury in elderly individuals, particularly those with weakened bones due to osteoporosis, is a “broken hip,” which
is actually a fracture of the femoral neck. This may result from a fall, or it may cause the fall. This can happen as one lower
limb is taking a step and all of the body weight is placed on the other limb, causing the femoral neck to break and producing
a fall. Any accompanying disruption of the blood supply to the femoral neck or head can lead to necrosis of these areas,
resulting in bone and cartilage death. Femoral fractures usually require surgical treatment, after which the patient will need
mobility assistance for a prolonged period, either from family members or in a long-term care facility. Consequentially, the
associated health care costs of “broken hips” are substantial. In addition, hip fractures are associated with increased rates of
morbidity (incidences of disease) and mortality (death).
