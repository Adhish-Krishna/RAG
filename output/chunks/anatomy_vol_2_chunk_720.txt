Posterior Pituitary

The posterior pituitary is actually an extension of the neurons of the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the
hypothalamus. The cell bodies of these regions rest in the hypothalamus, but their axons descend as the
hypothalamicâ€”hypophyseal tract within the infundibulum, and end in axon terminals that comprise the posterior pituitary
(Figure 17.8).
