The hymen is a thin membrane that sometimes partially covers the entrance to the vagina. An intact hymen cannot
be used as an indication of “virginity”; even at birth, this is only a partial membrane, as menstrual fluid and other secretions
must be able to exit the body, regardless of penile—vaginal intercourse. The vaginal opening is located between the opening
of the urethra and the anus. It is flanked by outlets to the Bartholin’s glands (or greater vestibular glands).
