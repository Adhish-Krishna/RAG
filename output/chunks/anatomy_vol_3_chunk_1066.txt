29 As an individual approaches puberty, two changes in sensitivity occur.
 The first is a decrease of sensitivity in the hypothalamus and pituitary to negative feedback, meaning that it takes increasingly
larger concentrations of sex steroid hormones to stop the production of LH and FSH. The second change in sensitivity is an increase
in the sensitivity of the gonads to the FSH and LH signals, meaning that the gonads of adults are more responsive to gonadotropins
than are the gonads of children. As a result of these two changes, the levels of LH and FSH slowly increase and lead to the
enlargement and maturation of the gonads, which in turn leads to secretion of higher levels of sex hormones and the initiation of
spermatogenesis and folliculogenesis. 30 The internal reproductive structures form from one of two rudimentary duct systems in
the embryo. Testosterone secretion stimulates growth of the male tract, the Wolffian duct. Secretions of sustentacular cells trigger
a degradation of the female tract, the Miillerian duct.
