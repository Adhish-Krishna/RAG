The standard method is to use a grid, but this is not possible with this resource. Try
constructing a simple table with each leukocyte type and then making a mark for each cell type you identify. Attempt
to classify at least 50 and perhaps as many as 100 different cells. Based on the percentage of cells that you count, do
the numbers represent a normal blood smear or does something appear to be abnormal?

 18.5 | Hemostasis

 By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the three mechanisms involved in hemostasis

¢ Explain how the extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways lead to the common pathway, and the coagulation
factors involved in each

* Discuss disorders affecting hemostasis

Platelets are key players in hemostasis, the process by which the body seals a ruptured blood vessel and prevents further
loss of blood.
