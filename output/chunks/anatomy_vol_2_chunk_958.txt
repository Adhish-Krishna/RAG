The pericardial cavity, filled with lubricating serous fluid, lies between the epicardium and the
pericardium.

CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 783

 In most organs within the body, visceral serous membranes such as the epicardium are microscopic. However, in the
case of the heart, it is not a microscopic layer but rather a macroscopic layer, consisting of a simple squamous epithelium
called a mesothelium, reinforced with loose, irregular, or areolar connective tissue that attaches to the pericardium. This
mesothelium secretes the lubricating serous fluid that fills the pericardial cavity and reduces friction as the heart contracts.
 Figure 19.5 illustrates the pericardial membrane and the layers of the heart.
