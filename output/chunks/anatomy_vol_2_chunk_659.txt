Subtests of walking begin with having the patient walk normally for a distance away from the examiner, and then turn
and return to the starting position. The examiner watches for abnormal placement of the feet and the movement of the arms
relative to the movement. The patient is then asked to walk with a few different variations. Tandem gait is when the patient
places the heel of one foot against the toe of the other foot and walks in a straight line in that manner. Walking only on the
heels or only on the toes will test additional aspects of balance.

 Ataxia

A movement disorder of the cerebellum is referred to as ataxia. It presents as a loss of coordination in voluntary
movements. Ataxia can also refer to sensory deficits that cause balance problems, primarily in proprioception and
equilibrium. When the problem is observed in movement, it is ascribed to cerebellar damage. Sensory and vestibular ataxia
would likely also present with problems in gait and station.
