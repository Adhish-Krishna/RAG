The standard electrocardiograph (the instrument
that generates an ECG) uses 3, 5, or 12 leads. The greater the number of leads an electrocardiograph uses, the more
information the ECG provides. The term “lead” may be used to refer to the cable from the electrode to the electrical recorder,
but it typically describes the voltage difference between two of the electrodes. The 12-lead electrocardiograph uses 10
electrodes placed in standard locations on the patient’s skin (Figure 19.22). In continuous ambulatory electrocardiographs,
the patient wears a small, portable, battery-operated device known as a Holter monitor, or simply a Holter, that continuously
monitors heart electrical activity, typically for a period of 24 hours during the patient’s normal routine.
