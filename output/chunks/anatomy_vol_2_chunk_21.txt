 About Human Anatomy and Physiology

Human Anatomy and Physiology is designed for the two-semester anatomy and physiology course taken by life science
and allied health students. It supports effective teaching and learning, and prepares students for further learning and future
careers. The text focuses on the most important concepts and aims to minimize distracting students with more minor details.

 The development choices for this textbook were made with the guidance of hundreds of faculty who are deeply
involved in teaching this course. These choices led to innovations in art, terminology, career orientation, practical
applications, and multimedia-based learning, all with a goal of increasing relevance to students.
