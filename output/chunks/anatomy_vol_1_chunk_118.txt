In
humans the DNA is organized into 46 chromosomes.

 After studying this chapter, you will be able to:

* Describe the fundamental composition of matter

¢ Identify the three subatomic particles

* Identify the four most abundant elements in the body

¢ Explain the relationship between an atom’s number of electrons and its relative stability

¢ Distinguish between ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and hydrogen bonds

¢ Explain how energy is invested, stored, and released via chemical reactions, particularly those reactions that
are critical to life

¢ Explain the importance of the inorganic compounds that contribute to life, such as water, salts, acids, and
bases

46 CHAPTER 2 | THE CHEMICAL LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION

* Compare and contrast the four important classes of organic (carbon-based) compounds—proteins,
carbohydrates, lipids and nucleic acids—according to their composition and functional importance to human
life

The smallest, most fundamental material components of the human body are basic chemical elements.
