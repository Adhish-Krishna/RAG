 On the whole, the posterior regions are responsible for sensory functions and the anterior regions are associated with
motor functions. This comes from the initial development of the spinal cord, which is divided into the basal plate and the
alar plate. The basal plate is closest to the ventral midline of the neural tube, which will become the anterior face of the
spinal cord and gives rise to motor neurons. The alar plate is on the dorsal side of the neural tube and gives rise to neurons
that will receive sensory input from the periphery.

 The length of the spinal cord is divided into regions that correspond to the regions of the vertebral column. The name
of a spinal cord region corresponds to the level at which spinal nerves pass through the intervertebral foramina. Immediately
adjacent to the brain stem is the cervical region, followed by the thoracic, then the lumbar, and finally the sacral region.
