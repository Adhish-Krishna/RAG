The most medial of these parts is called a sclerotome. The sclerotomes consist of an embryonic
tissue called mesenchyme, which will give rise to the fibrous connective tissues, cartilages, and bones of the body.

 The bones of the skull arise from mesenchyme during embryonic development in two different ways. The first
mechanism produces the bones that form the top and sides of the brain case. This involves the local accumulation o
mesenchymal cells at the site of the future bone. These cells then differentiate directly into bone producing cells, which form
the skull bones through the process of intramembranous ossification. As the brain case bones grow in the fetal skull, they
remain separated from each other by large areas of dense connective tissue, each of which is called a fontanelle (Figure
7.33). The fontanelles are the soft spots on an infantâ€™s head. They are important during birth because these areas allow the
skull to change shape as it squeezes through the birth canal.
