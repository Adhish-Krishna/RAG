If the kidney glomeruli are damaged by an autoimmune illness, large quantities of protein may be
lost in the urine. The resultant drop in serum osmolarity leads to widespread edema that, if severe, may lead to damaging
or fatal brain swelling. Severe hypertonic conditions may arise with severe dehydration from lack of water intake, severe
vomiting, or uncontrolled diarrhea. When the kidney is unable to recover sufficient water from the forming urine, the
consequences may be severe (lethargy, confusion, muscle cramps, and finally, death) .

 Recovery of Electrolytes

Sodium, calcium, and potassium must be closely regulated. The role of Na‚Äù and Ca** homeostasis has been discussed at

length. Failure of K* regulation can have serious consequences on nerve conduction, skeletal muscle function, and most
significantly, on cardiac muscle contraction and rhythm.

 PH Regulation

Recall that enzymes lose their three-dimensional conformation and, therefore, their function if the pH is too acidic or basic.
