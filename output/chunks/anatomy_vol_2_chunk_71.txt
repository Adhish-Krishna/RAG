But most everything else cannot, including white
blood cells, which are one of the body’s main lines of defense. While this barrier protects the CNS from exposure to toxic
or pathogenic substances, it also keeps out the cells that could protect the brain and spinal cord from disease and damage.
 The BBB also makes it harder for pharmaceuticals to be developed that can affect the nervous system. Aside from finding
efficacious substances, the means of delivery is also crucial.

 Also found in CNS tissue is the oligodendrocyte, sometimes called just “oligo,” which is the glial cell type that
insulates axons in the CNS. The name means “cell of a few branches” (oligo- = “few”; dendro- = “branches”; -cyte =
“cell”). There are a few processes that extend from the cell body. Each one reaches out and surrounds an axon to insulate it
in myelin. One oligodendrocyte will provide the myelin for multiple axon segments, either for the same axon or for separate
axons.
