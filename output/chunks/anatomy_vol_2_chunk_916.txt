Rh Blood Groups

The Rh blood group is classified according to the presence or absence of a second erythrocyte antigen identified as Rh.
(It was first discovered in a type of primate known as a rhesus macaque, which is often used in research, because its blood
is similar to that of humans.) Although dozens of Rh antigens have been identified, only one, designated D, is clinically
important. Those who have the Rh D antigen present on their erythrocytes—about 85 percent of Americans—are described

as Rh positive (Rh*) and those who lack it are Rh negative (Rh’). Note that the Rh group is distinct from the ABO group,
so any individual, no matter their ABO blood type, may have or lack this Rh antigen. When identifying a patient’s blood
type, the Rh group is designated by adding the word positive or negative to the ABO type.
