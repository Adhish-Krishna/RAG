Central Nervous System

The supply of blood to the brain is crucial to its ability to perform many functions. Without a steady supply of oxygen,
and to a lesser extent glucose, the nervous tissue in the brain cannot keep up its extensive electrical activity. These
nutrients get into the brain through the blood, and if blood flow is interrupted, neurological function is compromised.
