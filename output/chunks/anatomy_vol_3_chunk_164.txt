The serosa is the portion of the alimentary canal superficial to the muscularis. Present only in the region of the
alimentary canal within the abdominal cavity, it consists of a layer of visceral peritoneum overlying a layer of loose
connective tissue. Instead of serosa, the mouth, pharynx, and esophagus have a dense sheath of collagen fibers called the
adventitia. These tissues serve to hold the alimentary canal in place near the ventral surface of the vertebral column.

CHAPTER 23| THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 1025

Nerve Supply

As soon as food enters the mouth, it is detected by receptors that send impulses along the sensory neurons of cranial nerves.
 Without these nerves, not only would your food be without taste, but you would also be unable to feel either the food or the
structures of your mouth, and you would be unable to avoid biting yourself as you chew, an action enabled by the motor
branches of cranial nerves.
