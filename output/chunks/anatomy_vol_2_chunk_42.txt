A similar situation outside of science can be described for some roads.
 Imagine a road called “Broad Street” in a town called “Anyville.” The road leaves Anyville and goes to the next town over,
called “Hometown.” When the road crosses the line between the two towns and is in Hometown, its name changes to “Main
Street.” That is the idea behind the naming of the retinal axons. In the PNS, they are called the optic nerve, and in the CNS,
they are the optic tract. Table 12.1 helps to clarify which of these terms apply to the central or peripheral nervous systems.
