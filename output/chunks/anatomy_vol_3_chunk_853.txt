Natural occlusion has occurred when the umbilical cord is no longer pulsating. For the most part, the collapsed vessels
atrophy and become fibrotic remnants, existing in the mature circulatory system as ligaments of the abdominal wall and
liver. The ductus venosus degenerates to become the ligamentum venosum beneath the liver. Only the proximal sections of
the two umbilical arteries remain functional, taking on the role of supplying blood to the upper part of the bladder (Figure
28.22).

 Before birth Immediately after birth

The ductus arteriosus
Ductus constricts, allowing all
arteriosus blood leaving the

right ventricle to travel

to the lungs via the

pulmonary arteries.

 The foramen ovale closes,
leaving a small depression
Foramen called the fossa ovalis.
 ovale This isolates deoxygenated
and oxygenated blood
within the heart.
