Pacemaker cells stimulate the spontaneous contraction of cardiac muscle as a functional unit, called a
syncytium.

10.8 Smooth Muscle

Smooth muscle is found throughout the body around various organs and tracts. Smooth muscle cells have a single nucleus,
and are spindle-shaped. Smooth muscle cells can undergo hyperplasia, mitotically dividing to produce new cells. The
smooth cells are nonstriated, but their sarcoplasm is filled with actin and myosin, along with dense bodies in the sarcolemma
to anchor the thin filaments and a network of intermediate filaments involved in pulling the sarcolemma toward the fiberâ€™s

middle, shortening it in the process. Ca** ions trigger contraction when they are released from SR and enter through opened

voltage-gated calcium channels. Smooth muscle contraction is initiated when the Ca*~ binds to intracellular calmodulin,
which then activates an enzyme called myosin kinase that phosphorylates myosin heads so they can form the cross-bridges
with actin and then pull on the thin filaments.
