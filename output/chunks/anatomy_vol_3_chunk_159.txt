Even after development is complete, they maintain a connection to the gut by way of ducts.

 Histology of the Alimentary Canal

Throughout its length, the alimentary tract is composed of the same four tissue layers; the details of their structural
arrangements vary to fit their specific functions. Starting from the lumen and moving outwards, these layers are the mucosa,
submucosa, muscularis, and serosa, which is continuous with the mesentery (see Figure 23.3).
