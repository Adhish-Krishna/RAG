It acts
systemically to cause vasoconstriction as well as constriction of both the afferent and efferent arterioles of the glomerulus. In
instances of blood loss or dehydration, it reduces both GFR and renal blood flow, thereby limiting fluid loss and preserving
blood volume. Its release is usually stimulated by decreases in blood pressure, and so the preservation of adequate blood
pressure is its primary role.


1158 CHAPTER 25 | THE URINARY SYSTEM

Aldosterone, often called the “salt-retaining hormone,” is released from the adrenal cortex in response to angiotensin
II or directly in response to increased plasma K’. It promotes Na* reabsorption by the nephron, promoting the retention of
water. It is also important in regulating K”, promoting its excretion. (This dual effect on two minerals and its origin in the
adrenal cortex explains its designation as a mineralocorticoid.) As a result, renin has an immediate effect on blood pressure
due to angiotensin II-stimulated vasoconstriction and a prolonged effect through Na” recovery due to aldosterone.
