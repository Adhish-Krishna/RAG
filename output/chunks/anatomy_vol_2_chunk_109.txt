The channels that start depolarizing the membrane because of a stimulus help the cell to depolarize from -70 mV

to -55 mV. Once the membrane reaches that voltage, the voltage-gated Na” channels open. This is what is known as the
threshold. Any depolarization that does not change the membrane potential to -55 mV or higher will not reach threshold
and thus will not result in an action potential. Also, any stimulus that depolarizes the membrane to -55 mV or beyond will
cause a large number of channels to open and an action potential will be initiated.

 Because of the threshold, the action potential can be likened to a digital event—it either happens or it does not. If
the threshold is not reached, then no action potential occurs. If depolarization reaches -55 mV, then the action potential

continues and runs all the way to +30 mV, at which K* causes repolarization, including the hyperpolarizing overshoot.
