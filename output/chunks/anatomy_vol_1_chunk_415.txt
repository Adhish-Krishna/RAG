The macrophage cell is a large cell derived from a monocyte, a type of blood cell, which enters the connective tissue
matrix from the blood vessels. The macrophage cells are an essential component of the immune system, which is the
bodyâ€™s defense against potential pathogens and degraded host cells. When stimulated, macrophages release cytokines, small
proteins that act as chemical messengers. Cytokines recruit other cells of the immune system to infected sites and stimulate
their activities. Roaming, or free, macrophages move rapidly by amoeboid movement, engulfing infectious agents and
cellular debris. In contrast, fixed macrophages are permanent residents of their tissues.

 The mast cell, found in connective tissue proper, has many cytoplasmic granules. These granules contain the chemical
signals histamine and heparin. When irritated or damaged, mast cells release histamine, an inflammatory mediator, which
causes vasodilation and increased blood flow at a site of injury or infection, along with itching, swelling, and redness you
recognize as an allergic response.
