The switch to positive feedback—which occurs with
the elevated estrogen production from the dominant follicle—then stimulates the LH surge that will trigger ovulation. In a
typical 28-day menstrual cycle, ovulation occurs on day 14. Ovulation marks the end of the proliferative phase as well as
the end of the follicular phase.

 Secretory Phase

 In addition to prompting the LH surge, high estrogen levels increase the uterine tube contractions that facilitate the pick-up
and transfer of the ovulated oocyte. High estrogen levels also slightly decrease the acidity of the vagina, making it more
hospitable to sperm. In the ovary, the luteinization of the granulosa cells of the collapsed follicle forms the progesterone-
producing corpus luteum, marking the beginning of the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle. In the uterus, progesterone
from the corpus luteum begins the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, in which the endometrial lining prepares for
implantation (see Figure 27.15).
