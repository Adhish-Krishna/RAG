For example, the visual pathway projects from the retinae through the
thalamus to the primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe. This area is primarily in the medial wall within the longitudinal
fissure. Here, visual stimuli begin to be recognized as basic shapes. Edges of objects are recognized and built into more
complex shapes. Also, inputs from both eyes are compared to extract depth information. Because of the overlapping field
of view between the two eyes, the brain can begin to estimate the distance of stimuli based on binocular depth cues.

 Similar to how retinal disparity offers 3-D moviegoers a way to extract 3-D information from the two-dimensional
visual field projected onto the retina, the brain can extract information about movement in space by comparing what
the two eyes see.
