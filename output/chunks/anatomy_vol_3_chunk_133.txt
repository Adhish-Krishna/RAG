However, pulmonary
surfactant helps to reduce the surface tension so that the alveoli do not collapse during expiration. The ability of the lungs
to stretch, called lung compliance, also plays a role in gas flow. The more the lungs can stretch, the greater the potential
volume of the lungs. The greater the volume of the lungs, the lower the air pressure within the lungs.

 Pulmonary ventilation consists of the process of inspiration (or inhalation), where air enters the lungs, and expiration
(or exhalation), where air leaves the lungs. During inspiration, the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles contract,
causing the rib cage to expand and move outward, and expanding the thoracic cavity and lung volume. This creates a
lower pressure within the lung than that of the atmosphere, causing air to be drawn into the lungs. During expiration, the
diaphragm and intercostals relax, causing the thorax and lungs to recoil.
