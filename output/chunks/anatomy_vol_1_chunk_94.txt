The serous fluid
produced by the serous membranes reduces friction between the walls of the cavities and the internal organs when they
move, such as when the lungs inflate or the heart beats. Both the parietal and visceral serosa secrete the thin, slippery serous
fluid that prevents friction when an organ slides past the walls of a cavity. In the pleural cavities, pleural fluid prevents
friction between the lungs and the walls of the cavity. In the pericardial sac, pericardial fluid prevents friction between the
heart and the walls of the pericardial sac. And in the peritoneal cavity, peritoneal fluid prevents friction between abdominal
and pelvic organs and the wall of the cavity. The serous membranes therefore provide additional protection to the viscera
they enclose by reducing friction that could lead to inflammation of the organs.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Discuss the uses and drawbacks of X-ray imaging
Â¢ Identify four modern medical imaging techniques and how they are used

For thousands of years, fear of the dead and legal sanctions limited the ability of anatomists and physicians to study the
internal structures of the human body.
