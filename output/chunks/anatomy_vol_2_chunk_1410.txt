Thus, with the use of vaccines, one can avoid the damage
from disease that results from the first exposure to the pathogen, yet reap the benefits of protection from immunological
memory. The advent of vaccines was one of the major medical advances of the twentieth century and led to the eradication
of smallpox and the control of many infectious diseases, including polio, measles, and whooping cough.

 Active versus Passive Immunity
Natural Artificial

Active | Adaptive immune response Vaccine response

Passive | Trans-placental antibodies/breastfeeding | Immune globulin injections

Table 21.6

Passive immunity arises from the transfer of antibodies to an individual without requiring them to mount their own
active immune response. Naturally acquired passive immunity is seen during fetal development. IgG is transferred from
the maternal circulation to the fetus via the placenta, protecting the fetus from infection and protecting the newborn for
the first few months of its life.
