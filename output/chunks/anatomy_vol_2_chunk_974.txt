It is the most common
cause of cyanosis following birth. The term “tetralogy” is derived from the four components of the condition, although
only three may be present in an individual patient: pulmonary infundibular stenosis (rigidity of the pulmonary valve),
overriding aorta (the aorta is shifted above both ventricles), ventricular septal defect (opening), and right ventricular
hypertrophy (enlargement of the right ventricle). Other heart defects may also accompany this condition, which is
typically confirmed by echocardiography imaging. Tetralogy of Fallot occurs in approximately 400 out of one million
live births. Normal treatment involves extensive surgical repair, including the use of stents to redirect blood flow and
replacement of valves and patches to repair the septal defect, but the condition has a relatively high mortality. Survival
rates are currently 75 percent during the first year of life; 60 percent by 4 years of age; 30 percent by 10 years; and 5
percent by 40 years.
