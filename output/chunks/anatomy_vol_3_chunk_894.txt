In both cases, the person is blood type
A. Because Iâ€œ masks i, we say that F is dominant to i. Table 28.4 summarizes the expression of blood type.

Expression of Blood Types

Blood type Genotype Pattern of inheritance

A APA or Ai is dominant to i

B BP or i F is dominant to i

AB AP Fis co-dominant to 7
 [e) fi Two recessive alleles
Table 28.4

Certain combinations of alleles can be lethal, meaning they prevent the individual from developing in utero, or cause
a shortened life span. In recessive lethal inheritance patterns, a child who is born to two heterozygous (carrier) parents and
who inherited the faulty allele from both would not survive. An example of this is Tay-Sachs, a fatal disorder of the nervous
system. In this disorder, parents with one copy of the allele for the disorder are carriers.
