Figure 3.13 Prototypical Human Cell While this image is not indicative of any one particular human cell, it is a
prototypical example of a cell containing the primary organelles and internal structures.

 Organelles of the Endomembrane System

A set of three major organelles together form a system within the cell called the endomembrane system. These organelles
work together to perform various cellular jobs, including the task of producing, packaging, and exporting certain cellular
products. The organelles of the endomembrane system include the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and vesicles.

 Endoplasmic Reticulum

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a system of channels that is continuous with the nuclear membrane (or “envelope”)
covering the nucleus and composed of the same lipid bilayer material.
