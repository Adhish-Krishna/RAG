The walls of the ventricle are lined with trabeculae carneae, ridges of cardiac muscle covered by endocardium. In
addition to these muscular ridges, a band of cardiac muscle, also covered by endocardium, known as the moderator band
(see Figure 19.9) reinforces the thin walls of the right ventricle and plays a crucial role in cardiac conduction. It arises from
the inferior portion of the interventricular septum and crosses the interior space of the right ventricle to connect with the
inferior papillary muscle.

 When the right ventricle contracts, it ejects blood into the pulmonary trunk, which branches into the left and right
pulmonary arteries that carry it to each lung. The superior surface of the right ventricle begins to taper as it approaches the
pulmonary trunk. At the base of the pulmonary trunk is the pulmonary semilunar valve that prevents backflow from the
pulmonary trunk.
