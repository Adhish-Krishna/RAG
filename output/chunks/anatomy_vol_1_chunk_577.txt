Intramembranous Ossification

During intramembranous ossification, compact and spongy bone develops directly from sheets of mesenchymal
(undifferentiated) connective tissue. The flat bones of the face, most of the cranial bones, and the clavicles (collarbones) are
formed via intramembranous ossification.

 The process begins when mesenchymal cells in the embryonic skeleton gather together and begin to differentiate into
specialized cells (Figure 6.16a). Some of these cells will differentiate into capillaries, while others will become osteogenic
cells and then osteoblasts. Although they will ultimately be spread out by the formation of bone tissue, early osteoblasts
appear in a cluster called an ossification center.

 The osteoblasts secrete osteoid, uncalcified matrix, which calcifies (hardens) within a few days as mineral salts are
deposited on it, thereby entrapping the osteoblasts within. Once entrapped, the osteoblasts become osteocytes (Figure
6.16b). As osteoblasts transform into osteocytes, osteogenic cells in the surrounding connective tissue differentiate into new
osteoblasts.
