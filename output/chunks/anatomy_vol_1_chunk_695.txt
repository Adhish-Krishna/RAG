(a) Scoliosis (b) Kyphosis. (c) Lordosis

Figure 7.21 Abnormal Curvatures of the Vertebral Column (a) Scoliosis is an abnormal lateral bending of
the vertebral column. (b) An excessive curvature of the upper thoracic vertebral column is called kyphosis. (c)
Lordosis is an excessive curvature in the lumbar region of the vertebral column.

Normal Bone loss
vertebrae amplifies curvature

Figure 7.22 Osteoporosis Osteoporosis is an age-related disorder that causes the gradual loss of bone density

and strength. When the thoracic vertebrae are affected, there can be a gradual collapse of the vertebrae. This
results in kyphosis, an excessive curvature of the thoracic region.

Osteoporosis is a common age-related bone disease in which bone density and strength is decreased. Watch this
video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/osteoporosis) to get a better understanding of how thoracic vertebrae may become
weakened and may fracture due to this disease.
