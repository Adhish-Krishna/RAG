CHAPTER 6 | BONE TISSUE AND THE SKELETAL SYSTEM 217

Ag ng AND THE...

Skeletal System: Paget’s Disease

Paget’s disease usually occurs in adults over age 40. It is a disorder of the bone remodeling process that begins with
overactive osteoclasts. This means more bone is resorbed than is laid down. The osteoblasts try to compensate but the
new bone they lay down is weak and brittle and therefore prone to fracture.

 While some people with Paget’s disease have no symptoms, others experience pain, bone fractures, and bone
deformities (Figure 6.14). Bones of the pelvis, skull, spine, and legs are the most commonly affected. When occurring
in the skull, Paget’s disease can cause headaches and hearing loss.

 Normal Paget’s disease

Figure 6.14 Paget's Disease Normal leg bones are relatively straight, but those affected by Paget’s disease are
porous and curved.
