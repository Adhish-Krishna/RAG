Meconium passage is typically a complication of full-term or post-term newborns because it is rarely
passed before 34 weeks of gestation, when the gastrointestinal system has matured and is appropriately controlled
by nervous system stimuli. Fetal distress can stimulate the vagus nerve to trigger gastrointestinal peristalsis and
relaxation of the anal sphincter. Notably, fetal hypoxic stress also induces a gasping reflex, increasing the likelihood
that meconium will be inhaled into the fetal lungs.

 Although meconium is a sterile substance, it interferes with the antibiotic properties of the amniotic fluid and
makes the newborn and mother more vulnerable to bacterial infections at birth and during the perinatal period.
 Specifically, inflammation of the fetal membranes, inflammation of the uterine lining, or neonatal sepsis (infection in
the newborn) may occur. Meconium also irritates delicate fetal skin and can cause a rash.

 The first sign that a fetus has passed meconium usually does not come until childbirth, when the amniotic sac
ruptures.
