The remainder of the rib is the body of the rib (shaft). Just lateral to the tubercle is the angle of the rib,
the point at which the rib has its greatest degree of curvature. The angles of the ribs form the most posterior extent of the
thoracic cage. In the anatomical position, the angles align with the medial border of the scapula. A shallow costal groove
for the passage of blood vessels and a nerve is found along the inferior margin of each rib.

 Rib Classifications

The bony ribs do not extend anteriorly completely around to the sternum. Instead, each rib ends in a costal cartilage. These
cartilages are made of hyaline cartilage and can extend for several inches. Most ribs are then attached, either directly or
indirectly, to the sternum via their costal cartilage (see Figure 7.32). The ribs are classified into three groups based on their
relationship to the sternum.

 Ribs 1â€”7 are classified as true ribs (vertebrosternal ribs).
