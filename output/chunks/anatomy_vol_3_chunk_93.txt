 Hyperbaric chamber treatment is based on the behavior of gases. As you recall, gases move from a region of
higher partial pressure to a region of lower partial pressure. In a hyperbaric chamber, the atmospheric pressure is
increased, causing a greater amount of oxygen than normal to diffuse into the bloodstream of the patient. Hyperbaric
chamber therapy is used to treat a variety of medical problems, such as wound and graft healing, anaerobic bacterial
infections, and carbon monoxide poisoning. Exposure to and poisoning by carbon monoxide is difficult to reverse,
because hemoglobin’s affinity for carbon monoxide is much stronger than its affinity for oxygen, causing carbon
monoxide to replace oxygen in the blood. Hyperbaric chamber therapy can treat carbon monoxide poisoning, because
the increased atmospheric pressure causes more oxygen to diffuse into the bloodstream. At this increased pressure and
increased concentration of oxygen, carbon monoxide is displaced from hemoglobin.
