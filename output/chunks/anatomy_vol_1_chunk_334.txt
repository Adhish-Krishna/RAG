For cells that will divide again, G1 is followed by replication
of the DNA, during the S phase. The S phase (synthesis phase) is period during which a cell replicates its DNA.

Figure 3.30 Cell Cycle The two major phases of the cell cycle include mitosis (cell division), and interphase, when
the cell grows and performs all of its normal functions. Interphase is further subdivided into Gi, S, and G2 phases.

 After the synthesis phase, the cell proceeds through the G2 phase. The G2 phase is a second gap phase, during which
the cell continues to grow and makes the necessary preparations for mitosis. Between G1, S, and G2 phases, cells will vary
the most in their duration of the G1 phase. It is here that a cell might spend a couple of hours, or many days. The S phase
typically lasts between 8-10 hours and the G2 phase approximately 5 hours.
