This is called a receptive aphasia. 38 If
the person already has problems focusing on far objects, and wears corrective lenses to see farther objects, then as accommodation
changes, focusing on a reading surface might still be in their naturally near-sighted range. 39 The medulla is where the accessory
nerve, which controls the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and the hypoglossal nerve, which controls the genioglossus muscle, are
both located. The weakness of the left side of the neck, and the tendency of the tongue to point to that side, both show that
the damage is on the left side of the brain stem. 40 Where spinal nerves innervate the skin is represented by “slices” of the
body surface referred to as dermatomes. The fibers originating in each region are contained within the same spinal nerve, which
relates to the perception of that localization. 41 Paralysis means that voluntary muscle control is not possible because of the
interruption of descending motor input.
