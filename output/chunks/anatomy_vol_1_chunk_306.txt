Explain the organization of the DNA molecule within the nucleus
* Describe the process of DNA replication

The nucleus is the largest and most prominent of a cellâ€™s organelles (Figure 3.19). The nucleus is generally considered
the control center of the cell because it stores all of the genetic instructions for manufacturing proteins. Interestingly, some
cells in the body, such as muscle cells, contain more than one nucleus (Figure 3.20), which is known as multinucleated.
Other cells, such as mammalian red blood cells (RBCs), do not contain nuclei at all. RBCs eject their nuclei as they mature,
making space for the large numbers of hemoglobin molecules that carry oxygen throughout the body (Figure 3.21). Without
nuclei, the life span of RBCs is short, and so the body must produce new ones constantly.
