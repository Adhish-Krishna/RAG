For a healthy young adult, cardiac output
(heart rate x stroke volume) increases in the nonathlete from approximately 5.0 liters (5.25 quarts) per minute to a maximum
of about 20 liters (21 quarts) per minute. Accompanying this will be an increase in blood pressure from about 120/80 to
185/75. However, well-trained aerobic athletes can increase these values substantially. For these individuals, cardiac output
soars from approximately 5.3 liters (5.57 quarts) per minute resting to more than 30 liters (31.5 quarts) per minute during
maximal exercise. Along with this increase in cardiac output, blood pressure increases from 120/80 at rest to 200/90 at
maximum values.

 In addition to improved cardiac function, exercise increases the size and mass of the heart. The average weight of the
heart for the nonathlete is about 300 g, whereas in an athlete it will increase to 500 g. This increase in size generally makes
the heart stronger and more efficient at pumping blood, increasing both stroke volume and cardiac output.
