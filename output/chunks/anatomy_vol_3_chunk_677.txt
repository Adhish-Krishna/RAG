Because the ductus deferens is physically accessible within the scrotum, surgical sterilization to interrupt
sperm delivery can be performed by cutting and sealing a small section of the ductus (vas) deferens. This procedure is
called a vasectomy, and it is an effective form of male birth control. Although it may be possible to reverse a vasectomy,
clinicians consider the procedure permanent, and advise men to undergo it only if they are certain they no longer wish to
father children.

 Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/vasectomy) to learn about a vasectomy. As described in this video, a
vasectomy is a procedure in which a small section of the ductus (vas) deferens is removed from the scrotum. This
interrupts the path taken by sperm through the ductus deferens. If sperm do not exit through the vas, either because the
man has had a vasectomy or has not ejaculated, in what region of the testis do they remain?

From each epididymis, each ductus deferens extends superiorly into the abdominal cavity through the inguinal canal
in the abdominal wall.
