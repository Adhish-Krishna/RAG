Oxygen-Hemoglobin Dissociation and Effects of pH and Temperature These three graphs show
(a) the relationship between the partial pressure of oxygen and hemoglobin saturation, (b) the effect of pH on the
oxygen—hemoglobin dissociation curve, and (c) the effect of temperature on the oxygen—hemoglobin dissociation
curve.

 The mechanisms behind the oxygen—hemoglobin saturation/dissociation curve also serve as automatic control

mechanisms that regulate how much oxygen is delivered to different tissues throughout the body. This is important because
some tissues have a higher metabolic rate than others. Highly active tissues, such as muscle, rapidly use oxygen to produce
ATP, lowering the partial pressure of oxygen in the tissue to about 20 mm Hg. The partial pressure of oxygen inside
capillaries is about 100 mm Hg, so the difference between the two becomes quite high, about 80 mm Hg. As a result, a
greater number of oxygen molecules dissociate from hemoglobin and enter the tissues.
