It acts as a synergist of
the gluteus medius and iliopsoas in flexing and abducting the thigh. It also helps stabilize the lateral aspect of the knee by
pulling on the iliotibial tract (band), making it taut. Deep to the gluteus maximus, the piriformis, obturator internus,
obturator externus, superior gemellus, inferior gemellus, and quadratus femoris laterally rotate the femur at the hip.

Medial compartment of thigh

CHAPTER 11 | THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM 451

The adductor longus, adductor brevis, and adductor magnus can both medially and laterally rotate the thigh
depending on the placement of the foot. The adductor longus flexes the thigh, whereas the adductor magnus extends it. The
pectineus adducts and flexes the femur at the hip as well. The pectineus is located in the femoral triangle, which is formed
at the junction between the hip and the leg and also includes the femoral nerve, the femoral artery, the femoral vein, and the
deep inguinal lymph nodes.
