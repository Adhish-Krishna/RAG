The transport of Cl and the maintenance
of an electronegative environment outside of the cell attract positive ions such as Na” to the extracellular space.

 The accumulation of both Cl” and Na” ions in the extracellular space creates solute-rich mucus, which has a low
concentration of water molecules. As a result, through osmosis, water moves from cells and extracellular matrix into
the mucus, “thinning” it out. This is how, in a normal respiratory system, the mucus is kept sufficiently watered-down
to be propelled out of the respiratory system.

 If the CFTR channel is absent, Cl ions are not transported out of the cell in adequate numbers, thus preventing
them from drawing positive ions. The absence of ions in the secreted mucus results in the lack of a normal water
concentration gradient. Thus, there is no osmotic pressure pulling water into the mucus. The resulting mucus is thick
and sticky, and the ciliated epithelia cannot effectively remove it from the respiratory system.
