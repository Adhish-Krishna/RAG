1276 CHAPTER 28 | DEVELOPMENT AND INHERITANCE

X-linked Dominant or Recessive Inheritance

An X-linked transmission pattern involves genes located on the X chromosome of the 23rd pair (Figure 28.28). Recall
that a male has one X and one Y chromosome. When a father transmits a Y chromosome, the child is male, and when
he transmits an X chromosome, the child is female. A mother can transmit only an X chromosome, as both her sex
chromosomes are X chromosomes.

 When an abnormal allele for a gene that occurs on the X chromosome is dominant over the normal allele, the pattern
is described as X-linked dominant. This is the case with vitamin D-resistant rickets: an affected father would pass the
disease gene to all of his daughters, but none of his sons, because he donates only the Y chromosome to his sons (see
Figure 28.28a).
