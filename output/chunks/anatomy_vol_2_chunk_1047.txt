Blood is flowing into the right
atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and the coronary sinus. Blood flows into the left atrium from the four
pulmonary veins. The two atrioventricular valves, the tricuspid and mitral valves, are both open, so blood flows unimpeded
from the atria and into the ventricles. Approximately 70-80 percent of ventricular filling occurs by this method. The two
semilunar valves, the pulmonary and aortic valves, are closed, preventing backflow of blood into the right and left ventricles
from the pulmonary trunk on the right and the aorta on the left.

 Atrial Systole and Diastole

Contraction of the atria follows depolarization, represented by the P wave of the ECG. As the atrial muscles contract from
the superior portion of the atria toward the atrioventricular septum, pressure rises within the atria and blood is pumped
into the ventricles through the open atrioventricular (tricuspid, and mitral or bicuspid) valves.
