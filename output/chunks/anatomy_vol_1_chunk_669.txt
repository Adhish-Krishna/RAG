Inferior Nasal Conchae

The right and left inferior nasal conchae form a curved bony plate that projects into the nasal cavity space from the lower
lateral wall (see Figure 7.13). The inferior concha is the largest of the nasal conchae and can easily be seen when looking
into the anterior opening of the nasal cavity.

 Vomer Bone

The unpaired vomer bone, often referred to simply as the vomer, is triangular-shaped and forms the posterior-inferior part
of the nasal septum (see Figure 7.11). The vomer is best seen when looking from behind into the posterior openings of the
nasal cavity (see Figure 7.8a). In this view, the vomer is seen to form the entire height of the nasal septum. A much smaller
portion of the vomer can also be seen when looking into the anterior opening of the nasal cavity.

 Mandible

The mandible forms the lower jaw and is the only moveable bone of the skull.
