In contrast, low levels of carbon dioxide in the blood cause low levels of hydrogen ions in the
brain, leading to a decrease in the rate and depth of pulmonary ventilation, producing shallow, slow breathing.

 Another factor involved in influencing the respiratory activity of the brain is systemic arterial concentrations of

hydrogen ions. Increasing carbon dioxide levels can lead to increased H‚Äù levels, as mentioned above, as well as other
metabolic activities, such as lactic acid accumulation after strenuous exercise. Peripheral chemoreceptors of the aortic arch
and carotid arteries sense arterial levels of hydrogen ions. When peripheral chemoreceptors sense decreasing, or more
acidic, pH levels, they stimulate an increase in ventilation to remove carbon dioxide from the blood at a quicker rate.
 Removal of carbon dioxide from the blood helps to reduce hydrogen ions, thus increasing systemic pH.

Blood levels of oxygen are also important in influencing respiratory rate.
