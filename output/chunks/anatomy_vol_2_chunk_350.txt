There, amacrine cells additionally contribute to retinal processing before an action potential

is produced by the RGC.

 The axons of RGCs, which lie at the innermost layer of the retina, collect at the optic disc and leave the eye as the optic
nerve (see Figure 14.15). Because these axons pass through the retina, there are no photoreceptors at the very back of the
eye, where the optic nerve begins. This creates a “blind spot” in the retina, and a corresponding blind spot in our visual

field.
