Nervous tissue can also be described as gray matter and white matter on the basis of its appearance in unstained tissue.
 These descriptions are more often used in the CNS. Gray matter is where nuclei are found and white matter is where tracts
are found. In the PNS, ganglia are basically gray matter and nerves are white matter.

 The nervous system can also be divided on the basis of how it controls the body. The somatic nervous system (SNS)
is responsible for functions that result in moving skeletal muscles. Any sensory or integrative functions that result in
the movement of skeletal muscle would be considered somatic. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is responsible for
functions that affect cardiac or smooth muscle tissue, or that cause glands to produce their secretions. Autonomic functions
are distributed between central and peripheral regions of the nervous system. The sensations that lead to autonomic
functions can be the same sensations that are part of initiating somatic responses.
