¢ Discuss the physiological response of parathyroid dysfunction

The parathyroid glands are tiny, round structures usually found embedded in the posterior surface of the thyroid gland
(Figure 17.15). A thick connective tissue capsule separates the glands from the thyroid tissue. Most people have four
parathyroid glands, but occasionally there are more in tissues of the neck or chest. The function of one type of parathyroid
cells, the oxyphil cells, is not clear. The primary functional cells of the parathyroid glands are the chief cells. These epithelial
cells produce and secrete the parathyroid hormone (PTH), the major hormone involved in the regulation of blood calcium
levels.
