Histology

The liver has three main components: hepatocytes, bile canaliculi, and hepatic sinusoids. A hepatocyte is the liverâ€™s main
cell type, accounting for around 80 percent of the liver's volume. These cells play a role in a wide variety of secretory,
metabolic, and endocrine functions. Plates of hepatocytes called hepatic laminae radiate outward from the portal vein in
each hepatic lobule.

 Between adjacent hepatocytes, grooves in the cell membranes provide room for each bile canaliculus (plural =
canaliculi). These small ducts accumulate the bile produced by hepatocytes. From here, bile flows first into bile ductules
and then into bile ducts. The bile ducts unite to form the larger right and left hepatic ducts, which themselves merge and exit
the liver as the common hepatic duct. This duct then joins with the cystic duct from the gallbladder, forming the common
bile duct through which bile flows into the small intestine.
