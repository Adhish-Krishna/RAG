Discuss the role of ATP in metabolism
¢ Explain oxidation-reduction reactions
¢ Describe the hormones that regulate anabolic and catabolic reactions

Metabolic processes are constantly taking place in the body. Metabolism is the sum of all of the chemical reactions that are
involved in catabolism and anabolism. The reactions governing the breakdown of food to obtain energy are called catabolic
reactions. Conversely, anabolic reactions use the energy produced by catabolic reactions to synthesize larger molecules from
smaller ones, such as when the body forms proteins by stringing together amino acids. Both sets of reactions are critical to
maintaining life.

 Because catabolic reactions produce energy and anabolic reactions use energy, ideally, energy usage would balance the
energy produced. If the net energy change is positive (catabolic reactions release more energy than the anabolic reactions
use), then the body stores the excess energy by building fat molecules for long-term storage.
