Anteriorly directed myometrial
contractions also occur near the time of ovulation, and are thought to possibly facilitate the transport of sperm through the
female reproductive tract.

 The innermost layer of the uterus is called the endometrium. The endometrium contains a connective tissue lining,
the lamina propria, which is covered by epithelial tissue that lines the lumen. Structurally, the endometrium consists of two
layers: the stratum basalis and the stratum functionalis (the basal and functional layers). The stratum basalis layer is part
of the lamina propria and is adjacent to the myometrium; this layer does not shed during menses. In contrast, the thicker
stratum functionalis layer contains the glandular portion of the lamina propria and the endothelial tissue that lines the uterine
lumen. It is the stratum functionalis that grows and thickens in response to increased levels of estrogen and progesterone. In
the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, special branches off of the uterine artery called spiral arteries supply the thickened
stratum functionalis.
