The death of ovarian follicles is called atresia, and can occur at any point during follicular development. Recall that, a
female infant at birth will have one to two million oocytes within her ovarian follicles, and that this number declines
throughout life until menopause, when no follicles remain. As you’ll see next, follicles progress from primordial, to primary,

to

right before ovulation.

 secondary and tertiary stages prior to ovulation—with the oocyte inside the follicle remaining as a primary oocyte until

Folliculogenesis begins with follicles in a resting state. These small primordial follicles are present in newborn

females and are the prevailing follicle type in the adult ovary (Figure 27.12). Primordial follicles have only a single
flat layer of support cells, called granulosa cells, that surround the oocyte, and they can stay in this resting state for

years—some until right before menopause.
