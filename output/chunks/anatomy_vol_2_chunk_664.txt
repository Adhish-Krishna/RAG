loss of neurological function caused by an interruption of blood flow to a
region of the central nervous system

superficial reflex reflexive contraction initiated by gentle stimulation of the skin

superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP) white-matter tract representing output of the cerebellum to the red nucleus of
the midbrain

transient ischemic attack (TIA) temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain in which symptoms occur rapidly
but last only a short time

vermis prominent ridge along the midline of the cerebellum that is referred to as the spinocerebellum

vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) reflex based on connections between the vestibular system and the cranial nerves of
eye movements that ensures that images are stabilized on the retina as the head and body move

vestibulocerebellum flocculonodular lobe of the cerebellum named for the vestibular input from the eighth cranial
nerve

Weber test use of a tuning fork to test the laterality of hearing loss by placing it at several locations on the midline of
the skull

Wernickeâ€™s area region at the posterior end of the lateral sulcus in which speech comprehension is localized

16.1 Overview of the Neurological Exam

The neurological exam is a clinical assessment tool to determine the extent of function from the nervous system.
