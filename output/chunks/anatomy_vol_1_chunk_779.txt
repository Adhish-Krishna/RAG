UIna

The ulna is the medial bone of the forearm. It runs parallel to the radius, which is the lateral bone of the forearm (Figure
8.6). The proximal end of the ulna resembles a crescent wrench with its large, C-shaped trochlear notch. This region
articulates with the trochlea of the humerus as part of the elbow joint. The inferior margin of the trochlear notch is formed
by a prominent lip of bone called the coronoid process of the ulna. Just below this on the anterior ulna is a roughened
area called the ulnar tuberosity. To the lateral side and slightly inferior to the trochlear notch is a small, smooth area
called the radial notch of the ulna. This area is the site of articulation between the proximal radius and the ulna, forming
the proximal radioulnar joint. The posterior and superior portions of the proximal ulna make up the olecranon process,
which forms the bony tip of the elbow.
