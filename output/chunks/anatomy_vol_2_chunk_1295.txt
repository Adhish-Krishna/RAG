¢ The ductus arteriosus is a short, muscular vessel that connects the pulmonary trunk to the aorta. Most of the blood
pumped from the right ventricle into the pulmonary trunk is thereby diverted into the aorta. Only enough blood reaches
the fetal lungs to maintain the developing lung tissue. When the newborn takes the first breath, pressure within the
lungs drops dramatically, and both the lungs and the pulmonary vessels expand. As the amount of oxygen increases,
the smooth muscles in the wall of the ductus arteriosus constrict, sealing off the passage. Eventually, the muscular
and endothelial components of the ductus arteriosus degenerate, leaving only the connective tissue component of the
ligamentum arteriosum.

 * The ductus venosus is a temporary blood vessel that branches from the umbilical vein, allowing much of the freshly
oxygenated blood from the placenta—the organ of gas exchange between the mother and fetus—to bypass the fetal
liver and go directly to the fetal heart.
