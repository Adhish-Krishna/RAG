Table 26.2 *Acid metabolites from ingested chemical.

 The first three of the eight causes of metabolic acidosis listed are medical (or unusual physiological) conditions.
 Strenuous exercise can cause temporary metabolic acidosis due to the production of lactic acid. The last five causes result
from the ingestion of specific substances. The active form of aspirin is its metabolite, sulfasalicylic acid. An overdose of
aspirin causes acidosis due to the acidity of this metabolite. Metabolic acidosis can also result from uremia, which is the
retention of urea and uric acid. Metabolic acidosis can also arise from diabetic ketoacidosis, wherein an excess of ketones is
present in the blood. Other causes of metabolic acidosis are a decrease in the excretion of hydrogen ions, which inhibits the
conservation of bicarbonate ions, and excessive loss of bicarbonate ions through the gastrointestinal tract due to diarrhea.
