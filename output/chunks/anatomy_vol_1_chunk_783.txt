The distal end of the radius has a smooth surface for
articulation with two carpal bones to form the radiocarpal joint or wrist joint (Figure 8.7 and Figure 8.8). On the medial
side of the distal radius is the ulnar notch of the radius. This shallow depression articulates with the head of the ulna,
which together form the distal radioulnar joint. The lateral end of the radius has a pointed projection called the styloid
process of the radius. This provides attachment for ligaments that support the lateral side of the wrist joint. Compared
to the styloid process of the ulna, the styloid process of the radius projects more distally, thereby limiting the range of
movement for lateral deviations of the hand at the wrist joint.
