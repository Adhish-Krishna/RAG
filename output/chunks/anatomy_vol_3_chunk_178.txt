In chemical digestion, starting in the mouth, digestive secretions break down complex food molecules into their
chemical building blocks (for example, proteins into separate amino acids). These secretions vary in composition, but
typically contain water, various enzymes, acids, and salts. The process is completed in the small intestine.

 Food that has been broken down is of no value to the body unless it enters the bloodstream and its nutrients are put
to work. This occurs through the process of absorption, which takes place primarily within the small intestine. There,
most nutrients are absorbed from the lumen of the alimentary canal into the bloodstream through the epithelial cells that
make up the mucosa. Lipids are absorbed into lacteals and are transported via the lymphatic vessels to the bloodstream (the
subclavian veins near the heart). The details of these processes will be discussed later.

 In defecation, the final step in digestion, undigested materials are removed from the body as feces.
