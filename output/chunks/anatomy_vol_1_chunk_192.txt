All cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid-base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body
therefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and the
internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and its
conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids. For example, if there is even a slight
decrease below 7.35 in the pH of a bodily fluid, the buffer in the fluid—in this case, acting as a weak base—will bind the
excess hydrogen ions. In contrast, if pH rises above 7.45, the buffer will act as a weak acid and contribute hydrogen ions.

Excessive acidity of the blood and other body fluids is known as acidosis.
