Endurance training can result in overuse injuries such as stress fractures and joint and tendon inflammation.

Resistance Exercise

Resistance exercises, as opposed to endurance exercise, require large amounts of FG fibers to produce short, powerful
movements that are not repeated over long periods. The high rates of ATP hydrolysis and cross-bridge formation in FG
fibers result in powerful muscle contractions. Muscles used for power have a higher ratio of FG to SO/FO fibers, and trained
