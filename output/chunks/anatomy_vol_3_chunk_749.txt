As part of this SRY-prompted cascade, germ cells in
the bipotential gonads differentiate into spermatogonia. Without SRY, different genes are expressed, oogonia form, and
primordial follicles develop in the primitive ovary.

 Soon after the formation of the testis, the Leydig cells begin to secrete testosterone. Testosterone can influence tissues
that are bipotential to become male reproductive structures. For example, with exposure to testosterone, cells that could
become either the glans penis or the glans clitoris form the glans penis. Without testosterone, these same cells differentiate
into the clitoris.

 Not all tissues in the reproductive tract are bipotential. The internal reproductive structures (for example the uterus,
uterine tubes, and part of the vagina in females; and the epididymis, ductus deferens, and seminal vesicles in males) form
from one of two rudimentary duct systems in the embryo.
