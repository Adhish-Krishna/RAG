The mucus traps pathogens and debris, whereas beating cilia move the mucus superiorly toward the throat, where it
is swallowed. As the bronchioles become smaller and smaller, and nearer the alveoli, the epithelium thins and is simple
squamous epithelium in the alveoli. The endothelium of the surrounding capillaries, together with the alveolar epithelium,
orms the respiratory membrane. This is a blood-air barrier through which gas exchange occurs by simple diffusion.

 22.2 The Lungs

[he lungs are the major organs of the respiratory system and are responsible for performing gas exchange. The lungs are
paired and separated into lobes; The left lung consists of two lobes, whereas the right lung consists of three lobes. Blood
circulation is very important, as blood is required to transport oxygen from the lungs to other tissues throughout the body.
 The function of the pulmonary circulation is to aid in gas exchange. The pulmonary artery provides deoxygenated blood to
the capillaries that form respiratory membranes with the alveoli, and the pulmonary veins return newly oxygenated blood
to the heart for further transport throughout the body.
