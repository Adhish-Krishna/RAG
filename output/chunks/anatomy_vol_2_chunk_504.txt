Along these
two tracts, the hypothalamus can influence the Eddinger—Westphal nucleus of the oculomotor complex or the lateral horns
of the thoracic spinal cord.

Figure 15.11 Fiber Tracts of the Central Autonomic System The hypothalamus is the source of most of the central
control of autonomic function. It receives input from cerebral structures and projects to brain stem and spinal cord
structures to regulate the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic input to the organ systems of the body. The
main pathways for this are the medial forebrain bundle and the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus.

 These two tracts connect the hypothalamus with the major parasympathetic nuclei in the brain stem and the
preganglionic (central) neurons of the thoracolumbar spinal cord.
