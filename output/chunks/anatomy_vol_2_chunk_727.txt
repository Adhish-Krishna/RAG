Hypothalamus hormone stimulates.
 hormone pituitary to release hormones

Figure 17.9 Anterior Pituitary The anterior pituitary manufactures seven hormones. The hypothalamus produces
separate hormones that stimulate or inhibit hormone production in the anterior pituitary. Hormones from the
hypothalamus reach the anterior pituitary via the hypophyseal portal system.

 The anterior pituitary produces seven hormones. These are the growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone
(TSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), beta
endorphin, and prolactin. Of the hormones of the anterior pituitary, TSH, ACTH, FSH, and LH are collectively referred to
as tropic hormones (trope- = “turning”) because they turn on or off the function of other endocrine glands.

 Growth Hormone

The endocrine system regulates the growth of the human body, protein synthesis, and cellular replication. A major hormone
involved in this process is growth hormone (GH), also called somatotropin—a protein hormone produced and secreted
by the anterior pituitary gland.
