Figure 24.7 Krebs Cycle During the Krebs cycle, each pyruvate that is generated by glycolysis is converted into a
two-carbon acetyl CoA molecule. The acetyl CoA is systematically processed through the cycle and produces high-
energy NADH, FADH2, and ATP molecules.

Watch this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/krebscycle) to observe the Krebs cycle.

 The three-carbon pyruvate molecule generated during glycolysis moves from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrial
matrix, where it is converted by the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase into a two-carbon acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA)
molecule. This reaction is an oxidative decarboxylation reaction. It converts the three-carbon pyruvate into a two-carbon
acetyl CoA molecule, releasing carbon dioxide and transferring two electrons that combine with NAD* to form NADH.
 Acetyl CoA enters the Krebs cycle by combining with a four-carbon molecule, oxaloacetate, to form the six-carbon
molecule citrate, or citric acid, at the same time releasing the coenzyme A molecule.
