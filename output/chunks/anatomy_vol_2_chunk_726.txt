Hypothalamic hormones are secreted by neurons, but enter the anterior pituitary through blood vessels (Figure 17.9).
 Within the infundibulum is a bridge of capillaries that connects the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary. This network,
called the hypophyseal portal system, allows hypothalamic hormones to be transported to the anterior pituitary without
first entering the systemic circulation. The system originates from the superior hypophyseal artery, which branches off
the carotid arteries and transports blood to the hypothalamus. The branches of the superior hypophyseal artery form the
hypophyseal portal system (see Figure 17.9). Hypothalamic releasing and inhibiting hormones travel through a primary
capillary plexus to the portal veins, which carry them into the anterior pituitary. Hormones produced by the anterior pituitary
(in response to releasing hormones) enter a secondary capillary plexus, and from there drain into the circulation.
