Figure 28.8 Development of the Embryonic Disc Formation of the embryonic disc leaves spaces on either side
that develop into the amniotic cavity and the yolk sac.

 On the ventral side of the embryonic disc, opposite the amnion, cells in the lower layer of the embryonic disk (the
hypoblast) extend into the blastocyst cavity and form a yolk sac.
