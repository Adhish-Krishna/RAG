Damage, such as a stroke, that results
in changes in sensory discrimination may indicate these unrelated regions are affected as well.

 Gaze Control

The three nerves that control the extraocular muscles are the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves, which are the
third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves. As the name suggests, the abducens nerve is responsible for abducting the eye, which
it controls through contraction of the lateral rectus muscle. The trochlear nerve controls the superior oblique muscle to rotate
the eye along its axis in the orbit medially, which is called intorsion, and is a component of focusing the eyes on an object
close to the face. The oculomotor nerve controls all the other extraocular muscles, as well as a muscle of the upper eyelid.
 Movements of the two eyes need to be coordinated to locate and track visual stimuli accurately. When moving the eyes
to locate an object in the horizontal plane, or to track movement horizontally in the visual field, the lateral rectus muscle
of one eye and medial rectus muscle of the other eye are both active.
