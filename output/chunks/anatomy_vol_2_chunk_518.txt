Other drugs that enhance adrenergic function are not associated with therapeutic uses, but affect the functions of the
sympathetic system in a similar fashion. Cocaine primarily interferes with the uptake of dopamine at the synapse and can
also increase adrenergic function. Caffeine is an antagonist to a different neurotransmitter receptor, called the adenosine
receptor. Adenosine will suppress adrenergic activity, specifically the release of norepinephrine at synapses, so caffeine
indirectly increases adrenergic activity. There is some evidence that caffeine can aid in the therapeutic use of drugs, perhaps
by potentiating (increasing) sympathetic function, as is suggested by the inclusion of caffeine in over-the-counter analgesics

such as Excedrin®.
 Sympatholytic Drugs

Drugs that interfere with sympathetic function are referred to as sympatholytic, or sympathoplegic, drugs. They primarily
work as an antagonist to the adrenergic receptors. They block the ability of norepinephrine or epinephrine to bind to the

receptors so that the effect is “cut” or “takes a blow,” to refer to the endings “-lytic” and “-plegic,” respectively.
