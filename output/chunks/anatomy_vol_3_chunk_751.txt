Though the outcomes of puberty for
boys and girls are very different, the hormonal control of the process is very similar. In addition, though the timing of these
events varies between individuals, the sequence of changes that occur is predictable for male and female adolescents. As
shown in Figure 27.18, a concerted release of hormones from the hypothalamus (GnRH), the anterior pituitary (LH and
FSH), and the gonads (either testosterone or estrogen) is responsible for the maturation of the reproductive systems and the
development of secondary sex characteristics, which are physical changes that serve auxiliary roles in reproduction.

 The first changes begin around the age of eight or nine when the production of LH becomes detectable. The release
of LH occurs primarily at night during sleep and precedes the physical changes of puberty by several years. In pre-puberta!
children, the sensitivity of the negative feedback system in the hypothalamus and pituitary is very high.
