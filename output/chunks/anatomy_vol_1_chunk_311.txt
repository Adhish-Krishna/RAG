When a cell is in the process of division, the chromatin condenses into
chromosomes, so that the DNA can be safely transported to the “daughter cells.” The chromosome is composed of DNA
and proteins; it is the condensed form of chromatin. It is estimated that humans have almost 22,000 genes distributed on 46
chromosomes.

Figure 3.22 DNA Macrostructure Strands of DNA are wrapped around supporting histones. These proteins are
increasingly bundled and condensed into chromatin, which is packed tightly into chromosomes when the cell is ready
to divide.

 DNA Replication

 In order for an organism to grow, develop, and maintain its health, cells must reproduce themselves by dividing to produce
two new daughter cells, each with the full complement of DNA as found in the original cell.
