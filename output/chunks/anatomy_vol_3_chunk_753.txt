As a result of these two changes, the levels of LH and FSH slowly increase and lead to the enlargement
and maturation of the gonads, which in turn leads to secretion of higher levels of sex hormones and the initiation o
spermatogenesis and folliculogenesis.

 In addition to age, multiple factors can affect the age of onset of puberty, including genetics, environment, and
psychological stress. One of the more important influences may be nutrition; historical data demonstrate the effect of better
and more consistent nutrition on the age of menarche in girls in the United States, which decreased from an average age 0
approximately 17 years of age in 1860 to the current age of approximately 12.75 years in 1960, as it remains today.
