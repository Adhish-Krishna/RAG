Discuss the fundamental relationship between anatomy and physiology

Human anatomy is the scientific study of the body’s structures. Some of these structures are very small and can only
be observed and analyzed with the assistance of a microscope. Other larger structures can readily be seen, manipulated,
measured, and weighed. The word “anatomy” comes from a Greek root that means “to cut apart.” Human anatomy was
first studied by observing the exterior of the body and observing the wounds of soldiers and other injuries. Later, physicians
were allowed to dissect bodies of the dead to augment their knowledge. When a body is dissected, its structures are cut apart
in order to observe their physical attributes and their relationships to one another. Dissection is still used in medical schools,
anatomy courses, and in pathology labs. In order to observe structures in living people, however, a number of imaging
techniques have been developed.
