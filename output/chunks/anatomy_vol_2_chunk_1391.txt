An extracellular
pathogen is processed and presented in the binding cleft of a class Il MHC molecule, and this interaction is
strengthened by the CD4 molecule. (b) CD8 is associated with cytotoxic T cells. An intracellular pathogen is presented
by aclass | MHC molecule, and CD8 interacts with it.

 Although the correlation is not 100 percent, CD4-bearing T cells are associated with helper functions and CD8-bearing
T cells are associated with cytotoxicity. These functional distinctions based on CD4 and CD8 markers are useful in defining
the function of each type.

 Helper T Cells and their Cytokines

Helper T cells (Th), bearing the CD4 molecule, function by secreting cytokines that act to enhance other immune
responses. There are two classes of Th cells, and they act on different components of the immune response. These cells are
not distinguished by their surface molecules but by the characteristic set of cytokines they secrete (Table 21.5).
