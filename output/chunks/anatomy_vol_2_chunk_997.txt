It follows the anterior interventricular sulcus around the pulmonary trunk. Along the way it gives rise to numerous
smaller branches that interconnect with the branches of the posterior interventricular artery, forming anastomoses. An
anastomosis is an area where vessels unite to form interconnections that normally allow blood to circulate to a region even
if there may be partial blockage in another branch. The anastomoses in the heart are very small. Therefore, this ability is
somewhat restricted in the heart so a coronary artery blockage often results in death of the cells (myocardial infarction)
supplied by the particular vessel.

 The right coronary artery proceeds along the coronary sulcus and distributes blood to the right atrium, portions of both
ventricles, and the heart conduction system. Normally, one or more marginal arteries arise from the right coronary artery
