9.5 | Types of Body Movements

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Define the different types of body movements
¢ Identify the joints that allow for these motions

Synovial joints allow the body a tremendous range of movements. Each movement at a synovial joint results from the
contraction or relaxation of the muscles that are attached to the bones on either side of the articulation. The type of
movement that can be produced at a synovial joint is determined by its structural type. While the ball-and-socket joint gives
the greatest range of movement at an individual joint, in other regions of the body, several joints may work together to
produce a particular movement. Overall, each type of synovial joint is necessary to provide the body with its great flexibility
and mobility. There are many types of movement that can occur at synovial joints (Table 9.1).
