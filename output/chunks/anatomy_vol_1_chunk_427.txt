Elastic cartilage contains elastic fibers as well as collagen and proteoglycans. This tissue gives rigid support as well as
elasticity. Tug gently at your ear lobes, and notice that the lobes return to their initial shape. The external ear contains elastic
cartilage.

Figure 4.16 Types of Cartilage Cartilage is a connective tissue consisting of collagenous fibers embedded in a firm
matrix of chondroitin sulfates. (a) Hyaline cartilage provides support with some flexibility. The example is from dog
tissue. (b) Fibrocartilage provides some compressibility and can absorb pressure. (c) Elastic cartilage provides firm but
elastic support. From top, LM x 300, LM x 1200, LM x 1016. (Micrographs provided by the Regents of University of
