Appendicular System: Congenital Clubfoot

Clubfoot, also known as talipes, is a congenital (present at birth) disorder of unknown cause and is the most common
deformity of the lower limb. It affects the foot and ankle, causing the foot to be twisted inward at a sharp angle, like
the head of a golf club (Figure 8.21). Clubfoot has a frequency of about 1 out of every 1,000 births, and is twice as
likely to occur in a male child as in a female child. In 50 percent of cases, both feet are affected.
