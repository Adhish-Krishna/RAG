This pause is critical to heart function, as it allows the atrial cardiomyocytes to complete their contraction that pumps blood
into the ventricles before the impulse is transmitted to the cells of the ventricle itself. With extreme stimulation by the SA
node, the AV node can transmit impulses maximally at 220 per minute. This establishes the typical maximum heart rate in
a healthy young individual. Damaged hearts or those stimulated by drugs can contract at higher rates, but at these rates, the
heart can no longer effectively pump blood.

 Atrioventricular Bundle (Bundle of His), Bundle Branches, and Purkinje Fibers

Arising from the AV node, the atrioventricular bundle, or bundle of His, proceeds through the interventricular septum
before dividing into two atrioventricular bundle branches, commonly called the left and right bundle branches.
