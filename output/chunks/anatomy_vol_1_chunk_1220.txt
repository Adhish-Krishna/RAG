 Figure 11.34 Intrinsic Muscles of the Foot The muscles along the dorsal side of the foot (a) generally extend the
toes while the muscles of the plantar side of the foot (b, c, d) generally flex the toes. The plantar muscles exist in three
layers, providing the foot the strength to counterbalance the weight of the body. In this diagram, these three layers are
shown from a plantar view beginning with the bottom-most layer just under the plantar skin of the foot (b) and ending
with the top-most layer (d) located just inferior to the foot and toe bones.
