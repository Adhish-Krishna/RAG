The handle acts as a lever and the head of the hammer acts as a fulcrum, the fixed point that the force is applied
to when you pull back or push down on the handle. The effort applied to this system is the pulling or pushing on the handle
to remove the nail, which is the load, or “resistance” to the movement of the handle in the system. Our musculoskeletal
system works in a similar manner, with bones being stiff levers and the articular endings of the bones—encased in synovial
joints—acting as fulcrums. The load would be an object being lifted or any resistance to a movement (your head is a load
when you are lifting it), and the effort, or applied force, comes from contracting skeletal muscle.
