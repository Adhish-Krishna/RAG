The moveable end of the muscle that attaches to the bone being pulled
is called the muscle’s insertion, and the end of the muscle attached to a fixed (stabilized) bone is called the origin. During
forearm flexion—bending the elbow—the brachioradialis assists the brachialis.

 Although a number of muscles may be involved in an action, the principal muscle involved is called the prime mover,
or agonist. To lift a cup, a muscle called the biceps brachii is actually the prime mover; however, because it can be assisted
by the brachialis, the brachialis is called a synergist in this action (Figure 11.2). A synergist can also be a fixator that
stabilizes the bone that is the attachment for the prime mover’s origin.
