They are in the autonomic nervous system, as well as distributed throughout the brain.

 The cholinergic system has two types of receptors, the nicotinic receptor is found in the NMJ as well as other
synapses. There is also an acetylcholine receptor known as the muscarinic receptor. Both of these receptors are named for
drugs that interact with the receptor in addition to acetylcholine. Nicotine will bind to the nicotinic receptor and activate it
similar to acetylcholine. Muscarine, a product of certain mushrooms, will bind to the muscarinic receptor. However, nicotine
will not bind to the muscarinic receptor and muscarine will not bind to the nicotinic receptor.

Another group of neurotransmitters are amino acids. This includes glutamate (Glu), GABA (gamma-aminobutyric
acid, a derivative of glutamate), and glycine (Gly).
