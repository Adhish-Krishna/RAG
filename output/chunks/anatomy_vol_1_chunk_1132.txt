The orbicularis oris muscle is a circular muscle that goes around the mouth. When it contracts, the oral opening
becomes smaller, as when puckering the lips for whistling. Another example is the orbicularis oculi, one of which surrounds
each eye. Consider, for example, the names of the two orbicularis muscles (orbicularis oris and oribicularis oculi), where
part of the first name of both muscles is the same. The first part of orbicularis, orb (orb = “circular”), is a reference to a
round or circular structure; it may also make one think of orbit, such as the moon’s path around the earth. The word oris
(oris = “oral”) refers to the oral cavity, or the mouth. The word oculi (ocular = “eye”) refers to the eye.

 There are other muscles throughout the body named by their shape or location. The deltoid is a large, triangular-shaped
muscle that covers the shoulder.
