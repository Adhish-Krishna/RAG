The right atrium receives all of the systemic venous return. Most of the blood flows into either the superior vena cava
or inferior vena cava. If you draw an imaginary line at the level of the diaphragm, systemic venous circulation from above
that line will generally flow into the superior vena cava; this includes blood from the head, neck, chest, shoulders, and upper
limbs. The exception to this is that most venous blood flow from the coronary veins flows directly into the coronary sinus
and from there directly into the right atrium. Beneath the diaphragm, systemic venous flow enters the inferior vena cava,
that is, blood from the abdominal and pelvic regions and the lower limbs.

 The Superior Vena Cava

The superior vena cava drains most of the body superior to the diaphragm (Figure 20.36). On both the left and right sides,
the subclavian vein forms when the axillary vein passes through the body wall from the axillary region.
