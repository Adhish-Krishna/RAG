THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM

* Discuss the role of the innate immune response against pathogens

* Describe the power of the adaptive immune response to cure disease

Â¢ Explain immunological deficiencies and over-reactions of the immune system

* Discuss the role of the immune response in transplantation and cancer

* Describe the interaction of the immune and lymphatic systems with other body systems

In June 1981, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in Atlanta, Georgia, published a report of an unusual
cluster of five patients in Los Angeles, California. All five were diagnosed with a rare pneumonia caused by a fungus called
Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii).

 Why was this unusual? Although commonly found in the lungs of healthy individuals, this fungus is an opportunistic
pathogen that causes disease in individuals with suppressed or underdeveloped immune systems. The very young, whose
immune systems have yet to mature, and the elderly, whose immune systems have declined with age, are particularly
susceptible.
