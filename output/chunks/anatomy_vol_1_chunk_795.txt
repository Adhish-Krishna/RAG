This is the most frequent forearm fracture
and is a common injury in persons over the age of 50, particularly in older women with osteoporosis. It also commonly
occurs following a high-speed fall onto the hand during activities such as snowboarding or skating.

 The most commonly fractured carpal bone is the scaphoid, often resulting from a fall onto the hand. Deep pain at
the lateral wrist may yield an initial diagnosis of a wrist sprain, but a radiograph taken several weeks after the injury,
after tissue swelling has subsided, will reveal the fracture. Due to the poor blood supply to the scaphoid bone, healing
will be slow and there is the danger of bone necrosis and subsequent degenerative joint disease of the wrist.
