The outer, fibrous layer of a disc is called the anulus fibrosus. The gel-like interior is
called the nucleus pulposus. The disc can change shape to allow for movement between vertebrae. If the anulus fibrosus is
weakened or damaged, the nucleus pulposus can protrude outward, resulting in a herniated disc.

 The anterior longitudinal ligament runs along the full length of the anterior vertebral column, uniting the vertebral
bodies. The supraspinous ligament is located posteriorly and interconnects the spinous processes of the thoracic and lumbar
vertebrae. In the neck, this ligament expands to become the nuchal ligament. The nuchal ligament is attached to the
cervical spinous processes and superiorly to the base of the skull, out to the external occipital protuberance. The posterior
ongitudinal ligament runs within the vertebral canal and unites the posterior sides of the vertebral bodies. The ligamentum
â€˜Javum unites the lamina of adjacent vertebrae.
