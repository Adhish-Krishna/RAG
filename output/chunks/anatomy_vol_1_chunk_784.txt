Explain the problems that may occur if a fracture of the distal radius involves the joint surface of the
radiocarpal joint of the wrist.

 Carpal Bones

The wrist and base of the hand are formed by a series of eight small carpal bones (see Figure 8.7). The carpal bones are
arranged in two rows, forming a proximal row of four carpal bones and a distal row of four carpal bones. The bones in the
proximal row, running from the lateral (thumb) side to the medial side, are the scaphoid (“boat-shaped”), lunate (“moon-

shaped”), triquetrum (“three-cornered”), and
with the anterior surface of the triquetrum bo
can be felt at the medial base of your hand.
