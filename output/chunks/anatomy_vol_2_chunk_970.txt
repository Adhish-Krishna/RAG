The presence of the pulmonary trunk and aorta covers the
interatrial septum, and the atrioventricular septum is cut away to show the atrioventricular valves.

Heart: Heart Defects

One very common form of interatrial septum pathology is patent foramen ovale, which occurs when the septum
primum does not close at birth, and the fossa ovalis is unable to fuse. The word patent is from the Latin root patens for
“open.” It may be benign or asymptomatic, perhaps never being diagnosed, or in extreme cases, it may require surgical
repair to close the opening permanently. As much as 20-25 percent of the general population may have a patent
foramen ovale, but fortunately, most have the benign, asymptomatic version. Patent foramen ovale is normally detected
by auscultation of a heart murmur (an abnormal heart sound) and confirmed by imaging with an echocardiogram.
