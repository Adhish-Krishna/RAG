Figure 9.7 Cartiliginous Joints At cartilaginous joints, bones are united by hyaline cartilage to form a synchondrosis
or by fibrocartilage to form a symphysis. (a) The hyaline cartilage of the epiphyseal plate (growth plate) forms a
synchondrosis that unites the shaft (diaphysis) and end (epiphysis) of a long bone and allows the bone to grow in
length. (b) The pubic portions of the right and left hip bones of the pelvis are joined together by fibrocartilage, forming
the pubic symphysis.

 Synchondrosis

A synchondrosis (“joined by cartilage”) is a cartilaginous joint where bones are joined together by hyaline cartilage, or
where bone is united to hyaline cartilage.
