While Na* and

K* play essential roles, Ca?" is also critical for both types of cells. Unlike skeletal muscles and neurons, cardiac conductive
cells do not have a stable resting potential. Conductive cells contain a series of sodium ion channels that allow a normal and
slow influx of sodium ions that causes the membrane potential to rise slowly from an initial value of -60 mV up to about
â€”40 mV. The resulting movement of sodium ions creates spontaneous depolarization (or prepotential depolarization).

 At this point, calcium ion channels open and Ca?* enters the cell, further depolarizing it at a more rapid rate until it reaches
a value of approximately +5 mV. At this point, the calcium ion channels close and K* channels open, allowing outflux 0

K* and resulting in repolarization.
