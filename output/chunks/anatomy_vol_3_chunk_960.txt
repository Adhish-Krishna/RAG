In the thorax region, a portion of this cartilage model splits off to form the ribs. Similarly, mesenchyme forms cartilage
models for the right and left halves of the sternum. The ribs then become attached anteriorly to the developing sternum, and the
two halves of sternum fuse together. Ossification of the cartilage model into bone occurs within these structures over time. This
process continues until each is converted into bone, except for the sternal ends of the ribs, which remain as the costal cartilages.

1 A fracture through the joint surface of the distal radius may make the articulating surface of the radius rough or jagged. This
can then cause painful movements involving this joint and the early development of arthritis. Surgery can return the joint surface
to its original smoothness, thus allowing for the return of normal function. 2 The hand has a proximal transverse arch, a distal
transverse arch, and a longitudinal arch.
