26.4 Acid-Base Balance

A variety of buffering systems exist in the body that helps maintain the pH of the blood and other fluids within a narrow
range—between pH 7.35 and 7.45. A buffer is a substance that prevents a radical change in fluid pH by absorbing excess
hydrogen or hydroxyl ions. Most commonly, the substance that absorbs the ion is either a weak acid, which takes up a

hydroxyl ion (OH’), or a weak base, which takes up a hydrogen ion (H”). Several substances serve as buffers in the body,
including cell and plasma proteins, hemoglobin, phosphates, bicarbonate ions, and carbonic acid. The bicarbonate buffer
is the primary buffering system of the IF surrounding the cells in tissues throughout the body. The respiratory and renal
systems also play major roles in acid-base homeostasis by removing CO2 and hydrogen ions, respectively, from the body.
