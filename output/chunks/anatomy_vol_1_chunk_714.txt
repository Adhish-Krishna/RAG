Figure 7.30 Herniated Intervertebral Disc Weakening of the anulus fibrosus can result in herniation (protrusion) of
the nucleus pulposus and compression of a spinal nerve, resulting in pain and/or muscle weakness in the body regions
supplied by that nerve.

 Watch this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/diskslip) to see what it means to “slip” a disk. Watch this second
animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/herndisc) to see one possible treatment for a herniated disc, removing and
replacing the damaged disc with an artificial one that allows for movement between the adjacent certebrae. How could
lifting a heavy object produce pain in a lower limb?

Ligaments of the Vertebral Column

Adjacent vertebrae are united by ligaments that run the length of the vertebral column along both its posterior and anterior
aspects (Figure 7.31).
