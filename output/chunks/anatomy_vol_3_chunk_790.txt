Approximately 3 days after fertilization, a 16-cell conceptus reaches the uterus. The cells that had been loosely grouped
are now compacted and look more like a solid mass. The name given to this structure is the morula (morula = “little
mulberry”). Once inside the uterus, the conceptus floats freely for several more days. It continues to divide, creating a
ball of approximately 100 cells, and consuming nutritive endometrial secretions called uterine milk while the uterine lining
thickens. The ball of now tightly bound cells starts to secrete fluid and organize themselves around a fluid-filled cavity,
the blastocoel. At this developmental stage, the conceptus is referred to as a blastocyst. Within this structure, a group of
cells forms into an inner cell mass, which is fated to become the embryo. The cells that form the outer shell are called
trophoblasts (trophe = “to feed” or “to nourish”).
