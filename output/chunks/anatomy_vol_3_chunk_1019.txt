58 The presence of food in the GI tract
stimulates the release of hormones that aid in digestion. For example, gastrin is secreted in response to stomach distention and
causes the release of hydrochloric acid in the stomach. Secretin is secreted when acidic chyme enters the small intestine, and
stimulates the release of pancreatic bicarbonate. In the presence of fat and protein in the duodenum, CCK stimulates the release
of pancreatic digestive enzymes and bile from the gallbladder. Other GI tract hormones aid in glucose metabolism and other
functions. 59 The thymus gland is important for the development and maturation of T cells. During infancy and early childhood,
the thymus gland is large and very active, as the immune system is still developing. During adulthood, the thymus gland atrophies
because the immune system is already developed. 60 Menopause occurs as the result of a progressive decline in the function of the
ovaries, resulting in low estrogen and progesterone levels.
