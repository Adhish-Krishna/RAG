The primary cortical areas are where sensory information is
initially processed, or where motor commands emerge to go to the brain stem or spinal cord. Association areas are
adjacent to primary areas and further process the modality-specific input. Multimodal integration areas are found where
the modality-specific regions meet; they can process multiple modalities together or different modalities on the basis of
similar functions, such as spatial processing in vision or somatosensation.

 654 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM

A number of other regions, which extend beyond these primary or association areas of the cortex, are referred to as
integrative areas. These areas are found in the spaces between the domains for particular sensory or motor functions, and
they integrate multisensory information, or process sensory or motor information in more complex ways. Consider, for
example, the posterior parietal cortex that lies between the somatosensory cortex and visual cortex regions. This has been
ascribed to the coordination of visual and motor functions, such as reaching to pick up a glass.
