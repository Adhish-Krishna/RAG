There are suggestions that the steel rod led to changes in his personality. A
man who was a quiet, dependable railroad worker became a raucous, irritable drunkard. Later anecdotal evidence from his
life suggests that he was able to support himself, although he had to relocate and take on a different career as a stagecoach
driver.

 A psychiatric practice to deal with various disorders was the prefrontal lobotomy. This procedure was common in
the 1940s and early 1950s, until antipsychotic drugs became available. The connections between the prefrontal cortex and
other regions of the brain were severed. The disorders associated with this procedure included some aspects of what are
now referred to as personality disorders, but also included mood disorders and psychoses. Depictions of lobotomies in
popular media suggest a link between cutting the white matter of the prefrontal cortex and changes in a patientâ€™s mood and
personality, though this correlation is not well understood.
