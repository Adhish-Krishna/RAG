Since most plasma proteins
are produced by the liver, any condition affecting liver function can also change the viscosity slightly and therefore
decrease blood flow. Liver abnormalities include hepatitis, cirrhosis, alcohol damage, and drug toxicities. While leukocytes
and platelets are normally a small component of the formed elements, there are some rare conditions in which severe
overproduction can impact viscosity as well.

CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 855

Vessel Length and Diameter

The length of a vessel is directly proportional to its resistance: the longer the vessel, the greater the resistance and the lower
the flow. As with blood volume, this makes intuitive sense, since the increased surface area of the vessel will impede the
flow of blood. Likewise, if the vessel is shortened, the resistance will decrease and flow will increase.

 The length of our blood vessels increases throughout childhood as we grow, of course, but is unchanging in adults
under normal physiological circumstances.
