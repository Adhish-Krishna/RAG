As muscles age, muscle fibers die, and they are replaced by connective tissue and adipose tissue (Figure 10.20).
 Because those tissues cannot contract and generate force as muscle can, muscles lose the ability to produce powerful
contractions. The decline in muscle mass causes a loss of strength, including the strength required for posture and
mobility. This may be caused by a reduction in FG fibers that hydrolyze ATP quickly to produce short, powerful
contractions. Muscles in older people sometimes possess greater numbers of SO fibers, which are responsible for
longer contractions and do not produce powerful movements. There may also be a reduction in the size of motor units,
resulting in fewer fibers being stimulated and less muscle tension being produced.

Figure 10.20 Atrophy Muscle mass is reduced as muscles atrophy with disuse.

 Sarcopenia can be delayed to some extent by exercise, as training adds structural proteins and causes cellular
changes that can offset the effects of atrophy.
