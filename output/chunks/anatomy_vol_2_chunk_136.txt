However, when acetylcholine binds to the muscarinic receptor, of which there are several variants, it might
cause depolarization or hyperpolarization of the target cell.

 The amino acid neurotransmitters, glutamate, glycine, and GABA, are almost exclusively associated with just one
effect. Glutamate is considered an excitatory amino acid, but only because Glu receptors in the adult cause depolarization
of the postsynaptic cell. Glycine and GABA are considered inhibitory amino acids, again because their receptors cause
hyperpolarization.

 The biogenic amines have mixed effects. For example, the dopamine receptors that are classified as D1 receptors
are excitatory whereas D2-type receptors are inhibitory. Biogenic amine receptors and neuropeptide receptors can have
even more complex effects because some may not directly affect the membrane potential, but rather have an effect on
gene transcription or other metabolic processes in the neuron.
