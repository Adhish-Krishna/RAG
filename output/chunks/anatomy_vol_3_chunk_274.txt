Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/liver) to see the structure of the liver and how this structure supports
the functions of the liver, including the processing of nutrients, toxins, and wastes. At rest, about 1500 mL of blood per
minute flow through the liver. What percentage of this blood flow comes from the hepatic portal system?

 The Pancreas

The soft, oblong, glandular pancreas lies transversely in the retroperitoneum behind the stomach. Its head is nestled into the
“c-shaped” curvature of the duodenum with the body extending to the left about 15.2 cm (6 in) and ending as a tapering tail
in the hilum of the spleen. It is a curious mix of exocrine (secreting digestive enzymes) and endocrine (releasing hormones
into the blood) functions (Figure 23.26).
