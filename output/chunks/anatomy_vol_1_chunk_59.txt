Some others micronutrients, such as vitamin C and most of the B vitamins, are
water-soluble and cannot be stored, so you need to consume them every day or two.

 Narrow Range of Temperature

You have probably seen news stories about athletes who died of heat stroke, or hikers who died of exposure to cold. Such
deaths occur because the chemical reactions upon which the body depends can only take place within a narrow range of
body temperature, from just below to just above 37°C (98.6°F). When body temperature rises well above or drops well
below normal, certain proteins (enzymes) that facilitate chemical reactions lose their normal structure and their ability to
function and the chemical reactions of metabolism cannot proceed.

 That said, the body can respond effectively to short-term exposure to heat (Figure 1.8) or cold. One of the body’s
responses to heat is, of course, sweating.
