Solute Movement between Compartments

The movement of some solutes between compartments is active, which consumes energy and is an active transport process,
whereas the movement of other solutes is passive, which does not require energy. Active transport allows cells to move a
specific substance against its concentration gradient through a membrane protein, requiring energy in the form of ATP. For
example, the sodium-potassium pump employs active transport to pump sodium out of cells and potassium into cells, with
both substances moving against their concentration gradients.

 Passive transport of a molecule or ion depends on its ability to pass through the membrane, as well as the existence
of a concentration gradient that allows the molecules to diffuse from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower
concentration. Some molecules, like gases, lipids, and water itself (which also utilizes water channels in the membrane
called aquaporins), slip fairly easily through the cell membrane; others, including polar molecules like glucose, amino acids,
and ions do not.
