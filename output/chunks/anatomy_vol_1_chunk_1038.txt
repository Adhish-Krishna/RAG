(b)
The myosin head is attracted to actin, and myosin binds actin at its actin-binding site, forming the cross-bridge. (c)
During the power stroke, the phosphate generated in the previous contraction cycle is released. This results in the
myosin head pivoting toward the center of the sarcomere, after which the attached ADP and phosphate group are
released. (d) A new molecule of ATP attaches to the myosin head, causing the cross-bridge to detach. (e) The myosin
head hydrolyzes ATP to ADP and phosphate, which returns the myosin to the cocked position.

 Cross-bridge formation occurs when the myosin head attaches to the actin while adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and
inorganic phosphate (Pi) are still bound to myosin (Figure 10.11a,b). Pi is then released, causing myosin to form a stronger
attachment to the actin, after which the myosin head moves toward the M-line, pulling the actin along with it.
