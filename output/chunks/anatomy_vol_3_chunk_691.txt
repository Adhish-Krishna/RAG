The regulation of Leydig cell production of testosterone begins outside of the testes. The hypothalamus and the
pituitary gland in the brain integrate external and internal signals to control testosterone synthesis and secretion. The
regulation begins in the hypothalamus. Pulsatile release of a hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
from the hypothalamus stimulates the endocrine release of hormones from the pituitary gland. Binding of GnRH to its
receptors on the anterior pituitary gland stimulates release of the two gonadotropins: luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-
stimulating hormone (FSH). These two hormones are critical for reproductive function in both men and women. In men,
FSH binds predominantly to the Sertoli cells within the seminiferous tubules to promote spermatogenesis. FSH also
stimulates the Sertoli cells to produce hormones called inhibins, which function to inhibit FSH release from the pituitary,
thus reducing testosterone secretion. These polypeptide hormones correlate directly with Sertoli cell function and sperm
number; inhibin B can be used as a marker of spermatogenic activity.
