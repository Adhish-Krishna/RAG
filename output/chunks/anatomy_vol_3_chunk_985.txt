42 Endurance training modifies slow fibers to make them more efficient by producing more
mitochondria to enable more aerobic metabolism and more ATP production. Endurance exercise can also increase the amount of
myoglobin in a cell and formation of more extensive capillary networks around the fiber. 43 Resistance exercises affect muscles
by causing the formation of more actin and myosin, increasing the structure of muscle fibers. 44 An action potential could reach
a cardiac muscle cell before it has entered the relaxation phase, resulting in the sustained contractions of tetanus. If this happened,
the heart would not beat regularly. 45 Cardiac and skeletal muscle cells both contain ordered myofibrils and are striated. Cardiac
muscle cells are branched and contain intercalated discs, which skeletal muscles do not have. 46 Smooth muscles can contract
over a wider range of resting lengths because the actin and myosin filaments in smooth muscle are not as rigidly organized as those
in skeletal and cardiac muscle.
