In reality, all blood vessels exhibit vascular tone due to the partial contraction of smooth muscle. The importance of
the arterioles is that they will be the primary site of both resistance and regulation of blood pressure. The precise diameter
of the lumen of an arteriole at any given moment is determined by neural and chemical controls, and vasoconstriction and
vasodilation in the arterioles are the primary mechanisms for distribution of blood flow.

 Capillaries

A capillary is a microscopic channel that supplies blood to the tissues themselves, a process called perfusion. Exchange
of gases and other substances occurs in the capillaries between the blood and the surrounding cells and their tissue fluid
(interstitial fluid). The diameter of a capillary lumen ranges from 5-10 micrometers; the smallest are just barely wide
enough for an erythrocyte to squeeze through. Flow through capillaries is often described as microcirculation.

 The wall of a capillary consists of the endothelial layer surrounded by a basement membrane with occasional smooth
muscle fibers.
