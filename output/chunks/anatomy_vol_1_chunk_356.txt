The stem cells
isolated from umbilical cord blood are also multipotent, as are cells from deciduous teeth (baby teeth). Researchers
have recently developed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from mouse and human adult stem cells. These cells
are genetically reprogrammed multipotent adult cells that function like embryonic stem cells; they are capable of
generating cells characteristic of all three germ layers.

 Because of their capacity to divide and differentiate into specialized cells, stem cells offer a potential treatment
for diseases such as diabetes and heart disease (Figure 3.36). Cell-based therapy refers to treatment in which stem
cells induced to differentiate in a growth dish are injected into a patient to repair damaged or destroyed cells or tissues.
 Many obstacles must be overcome for the application of cell-based therapy. Although embryonic stem cells have a
nearly unlimited range of differentiation potential, they are seen as foreign by the patientâ€™s immune system and may
trigger rejection.
