Similarly, norepinephrine and noradrenaline are two names for the same molecule.

 Having understood the cholinergic and adrenergic systems, their role in the autonomic system is relatively simple
to understand. All preganglionic fibers, both sympathetic and parasympathetic, release ACh. All ganglionic neurons—the
targets of these preganglionic fibers—have nicotinic receptors in their cell membranes. The nicotinic receptor is a ligand-
gated cation channel that results in depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. The postganglionic parasympathetic
fibers also release ACh, but the receptors on their targets are muscarinic receptors, which are G protein—coupled receptors
and do not exclusively cause depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers release
norepinephrine, except for fibers that project to sweat glands and to blood vessels associated with skeletal muscles, which
release ACh (Table 15.1).
