Following birth, most
hemopoiesis occurs in the red marrow, a connective tissue within the spaces of spongy (cancellous) bone tissue. In children,
hemopoiesis can occur in the medullary cavity of long bones; in adults, the process is largely restricted to the cranial and
pelvic bones, the vertebrae, the sternum, and the proximal epiphyses of the femur and humerus.

 Throughout adulthood, the liver and spleen maintain their ability to generate the formed elements. This process is
referred to as extramedullary hemopoiesis (meaning hemopoiesis outside the medullary cavity of adult bones). When a
disease such as bone cancer destroys the bone marrow, causing hemopoiesis to fail, extramedullary hemopoiesis may be
initiated.

 Differentiation of Formed Elements from Stem Cells

All formed elements arise from stem cells of the red bone marrow. Recall that stem cells undergo mitosis plus cytokinesis
(cellular division) to give rise to new daughter cells: One of these remains a stem cell and the other differentiates into one
of any number of diverse cell types.
