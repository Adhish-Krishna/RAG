Both of these requirements
are fulfilled by other types of RNA. The substrate on which translation takes place is the ribosome.

 Remember that many of a cell’s ribosomes are found associated with the rough ER, and carry out the synthesis of
proteins destined for the Golgi apparatus. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a type of RNA that, together with proteins, composes
the structure of the ribosome. Ribosomes exist in the cytoplasm as two distinct components, a small and a large subunit.
 When an mRNA molecule is ready to be translated, the two subunits come together and attach to the mRNA. The ribosome
provides a substrate for translation, bringing together and aligning the mRNA molecule with the molecular “translators”
that must decipher its code.

 The other major requirement for protein synthesis is the translator molecules that physically “read” the mRNA codons.
 Transfer RNA (tRNA) is a type of RNA that ferries the appropriate corresponding amino acids to the ribosome, and
attaches each new amino acid to the last, building the polypeptide chain one-by-one.
