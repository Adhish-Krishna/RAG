Figure 21.12 Cooperation between Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses The innate immune system
enhances adaptive immune responses so they can be more effective.

 Any discussion of the innate immune response usually begins with the physical barriers that prevent pathogens from
entering the body, destroy them after they enter, or flush them out before they can establish themselves in the hospitable
environment of the body’s soft tissues. Barrier defenses are part of the body’s most basic defense mechanisms. The barrier
defenses are not a response to infections, but they are continuously working to protect against a broad range of pathogens.
