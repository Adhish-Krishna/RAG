The shape change of retinal in the photoreceptors initiates visual transduction in the retina. Activation of retinal and the
opsin proteins result in activation of a G protein. The G protein changes the membrane potential of the photoreceptor cell,
which then releases less neurotransmitter into the outer synaptic layer of the retina. Until the retinal molecule is changed
back to the 11-cis-retinal shape, the opsin cannot respond to light energy, which is called bleaching. When a large group
of photopigments is bleached, the retina will send information as if opposing visual information is being perceived. After a
bright flash of light, afterimages are usually seen in negative. The photoisomerization is reversed by a series of enzymatic
changes so that the retinal responds to more light energy.
