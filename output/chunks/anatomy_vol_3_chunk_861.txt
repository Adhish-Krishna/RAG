Structure of the Lactating Breast

Mammary glands are modified sweat glands. The non-pregnant and non-lactating female breast is composed primarily
of adipose and collagenous tissue, with mammary glands making up a very minor proportion of breast volume. The
mammary gland is composed of milk-transporting lactiferous ducts, which expand and branch extensively during pregnancy
in response to estrogen, growth hormone, cortisol, and prolactin. Moreover, in response to progesterone, clusters of breast
alveoli bud from the ducts and expand outward toward the chest wall. Breast alveoli are balloon-like structures lined with
milk-secreting cuboidal cells, or lactocytes, that are surrounded by a net of contractile myoepithelial cells. Milk is secreted
from the lactocytes, fills the alveoli, and is squeezed into the ducts. Clusters of alveoli that drain to a common duct are
called lobules; the lactating female has 12-20 lobules organized radially around the nipple.
