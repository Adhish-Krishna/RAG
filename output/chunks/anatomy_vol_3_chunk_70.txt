The DRG is involved in maintaining a constant breathing rhythm by stimulating the diaphragm and intercostal muscles to
contract, resulting in inspiration. When activity in the DRG ceases, it no longer stimulates the diaphragm and intercostals
to contract, allowing them to relax, resulting in expiration. The VRG is involved in forced breathing, as the neurons in the

VRG stimulate the accessory muscles involved in forced breathing to contract, resulting in forced inspiration. The VRG
also stimulates the accessory muscles involved in forced expiration to contract.

 The second respiratory center of the brain is located within the pons, called the pontine respiratory group, and consists
of the apneustic and pneumotaxic centers. The apneustic center is a double cluster of neuronal cell bodies that stimulate
neurons in the DRG, controlling the depth of inspiration, particularly for deep breathing.
