28.7 Patterns of Inheritance

There are two aspects to a person’s genetic makeup. Their genotype refers to the genetic makeup of the chromosomes found
in all their cells and the alleles that are passed down from their parents. Their phenotype is the expression of that genotype,
based on the interaction of the paired alleles, as well as how environmental conditions affect that expression.

 Working with pea plants, Mendel discovered that the factors that account for different traits in parents are discretely
transmitted to offspring in pairs, one from each parent. He articulated the principles of random segregation and independent
assortment to account for the inheritance patterns he observed. Mendel’s factors are genes, with differing variants being
referred to as alleles and those alleles being dominant or recessive in expression. Each parent passes one allele for every
gene on to offspring, and offspring are equally likely to inherit any combination of allele pairs.
