CHAPTER 28 | DEVELOPMENT AND INHERITANCE 1275

N Generation 2:
50% are dominant (Nn) and
= have neurofibromatosis
50% are recessive (nn) and
n nn nn do not show the disease

Figure 28.26 Autosomal Dominant Inheritance Inheritance pattern of an autosomal dominant disorder, such as
neurofibromatosis, is shown in a Punnett square.

 Other genetic diseases that are inherited in this pattern are achondroplastic dwarfism, Marfan syndrome, and
Huntington’s disease. Because autosomal dominant disorders are expressed by the presence of just one gene, an individual
with the disorder will know that he or she has at least one faulty gene. The expression of the disease may manifest later in
life, after the childbearing years, which is the case in Huntington’s disease (discussed in more detail later in this section).
