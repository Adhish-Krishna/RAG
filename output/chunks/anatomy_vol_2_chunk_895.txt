Plug formation, in essence, buys the body time
while more sophisticated and durable repairs are being made. In a similar manner, even modern naval warships still carry
an assortment of wooden plugs to temporarily repair small breaches in their hulls until permanent repairs can be made.

 Coagulation

Those more sophisticated and more durable repairs are collectively called coagulation, the formation of a blood clot. The
process is sometimes characterized as a cascade, because one event prompts the next as in a multi-level waterfall. The result
is the production of a gelatinous but robust clot made up of a mesh of fibrin—an insoluble filamentous protein derived from
fibrinogen, the plasma protein introduced earlier—in which platelets and blood cells are trapped. Figure 18.14 summarizes
the three steps of hemostasis.
