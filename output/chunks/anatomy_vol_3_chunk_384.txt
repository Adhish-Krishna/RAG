It occurs primarily in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the kidney. Prior to the urea cycle,
ammonium ions are produced from the breakdown of amino acids. In these reactions, an amine group, or ammonium ion,

from the amino acid is exchanged with a keto group on another molecule. This transamination event creates a molecule
that is necessary for the Krebs cycle and an ammonium ion that enters into the urea cycle to be eliminated.

 In the urea cycle, ammonium is combined with CO2, resulting in urea and water. The urea is eliminated through the
kidneys in the urine (Figure 24.18).
