Collagen fibers anchor a lymphatic capillary in the tissue (inset). Interstitial fluid slips through
spaces between the overlapping endothelial cells that compose the lymphatic capillary.

 Lymphatic capillaries are formed by a one cell-thick layer of endothelial cells and represent the open end of the
system, allowing interstitial fluid to flow into them via overlapping cells (see Figure 21.3). When interstitial pressure is
low, the endothelial flaps close to prevent “backflow.” As interstitial pressure increases, the spaces between the cells open
up, allowing the fluid to enter. Entry of fluid into lymphatic capillaries is also enabled by the collagen filaments that anchor
the capillaries to surrounding structures. As interstitial pressure increases, the filaments pull on the endothelial cell flaps,
opening up them even further to allow easy entry of fluid.

 In the small intestine, lymphatic capillaries called lacteals are critical for the transport of dietary lipids and lipid-soluble
vitamins to the bloodstream.
