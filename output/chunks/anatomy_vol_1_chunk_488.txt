In contrast, too much melanin can interfere with
the production of vitamin D, an important nutrient involved in calcium absorption. Thus, the amount of melanin present in
our skin is dependent on a balance between available sunlight and folic acid destruction, and protection from UV radiation
and vitamin D production.

 It requires about 10 days after initial sun exposure for melanin synthesis to peak, which is why pale-skinned
individuals tend to suffer sunburns of the epidermis initially. Dark-skinned individuals can also get sunburns, but are more
protected than are pale-skinned individuals. Melanosomes are temporary structures that are eventually destroyed by fusion
with lysosomes; this fact, along with melanin-filled keratinocytes in the stratum corneum sloughing off, makes tanning
impermanent.

 Too much sun exposure can eventually lead to wrinkling due to the destruction of the cellular structure of the skin,
and in severe cases, can cause sufficient DNA damage to result in skin cancer.
