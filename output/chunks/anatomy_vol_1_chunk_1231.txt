The perineum muscles play roles in urination in both sexes, ejaculation in men, and vaginal contraction in women.
 The pelvic floor muscles support the pelvic organs, resist intra-abdominal pressure, and work as sphincters for the urethra,
rectum, and vagina.

11.5 Muscles of the Pectoral Girdle and Upper Limbs

The clavicle and scapula make up the pectoral girdle, which provides a stable origin for the muscles that move the
humerus. The muscles that position and stabilize the pectoral girdle are located on the thorax. The anterior thoracic muscles
are the subclavius, pectoralis minor, and the serratus anterior. The posterior thoracic muscles are the trapezius, levator
scapulae, rhomboid major, and rhomboid minor. Nine muscles cross the shoulder joint to move the humerus. The ones that
originate on the axial skeleton are the pectoralis major and the latissimus dorsi. The deltoid, subscapularis, supraspinatus,
infraspinatus, teres major, teres minor, and coracobrachialis originate on the scapula.
