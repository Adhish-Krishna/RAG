Several structures within the conducting zone
perform other functions as well. The epithelium of the nasal passages, for example, is essential to sensing odors, and the
bronchial epithelium that lines the lungs can metabolize some airborne carcinogens.

The external nose consists of the surface and skeletal structures that result in the outward appearance of the nose and
contribute to its numerous functions (Figure 22.3). The root is the region of the nose located between the eyebrows. The
