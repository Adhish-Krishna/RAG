The pituitary gland is cradled within the sellaturcica of the
sphenoid bone of the skull. It consists of two lobes that arise from distinct parts of embryonic tissue: the posterior pituitary
(neurohypophysis) is neural tissue, whereas the anterior pituitary (also known as the adenohypophysis) is glandular tissue
that develops from the primitive digestive tract. The hormones secreted by the posterior and anterior pituitary, and the
intermediate zone between the lobes are summarized in Table 17.3.

Figure 17.7 Hypothalamus-â€”Pituitary Complex The hypothalamus region lies inferior and anterior to the thalamus.
 It connects to the pituitary gland by the stalk-like infundibulum. The pituitary gland consists of an anterior and posterior
lobe, with each lobe secreting different hormones in response to signals from the hypothalamus.
