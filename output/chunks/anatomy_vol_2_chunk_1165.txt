The vascular tone of the vessel is the contractile state of the
smooth muscle and the primary determinant of diameter, and thus of resistance and flow. The effect of vessel diameter on
resistance is inverse: Given the same volume of blood, an increased diameter means there is less blood contacting the vessel
wall, thus lower friction and lower resistance, subsequently increasing flow. A decreased diameter means more of the blood
contacts the vessel wall, and resistance increases, subsequently decreasing flow.

 The influence of lumen diameter on resistance is dramatic: A slight increase or decrease in diameter causes a huge
decrease or increase in resistance. This is because resistance is inversely proportional to the radius of the blood vessel (one-

half of the vesselâ€™s diameter) raised to the fourth power (R = 1/r*). This means, for example, that if an artery or arteriole
constricts to one-half of its original radius, the resistance to flow will increase 16 times.
