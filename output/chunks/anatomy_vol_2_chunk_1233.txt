he vertebral foramen in the cervical vertebrae and then through the foramen magnum

into the cranial cavity to supply blood to the brain and spinal cord. The paired vertebral arteries join together to form the
large basilar artery at the base of the medulla oblongata. This is an example of an anastomosis. The subclavian artery also
gives rise to the thyrocervical artery that provides blood to the thyroid, the cervical region of the neck, and the upper back
and shoulder.

 The common carotid artery divides into internal and external carotid arteries. The right common carotid artery arises
from the brachiocephalic artery and the left common carotid artery arises directly from the aortic arch. The external carotid
artery supplies blood to numerous structures within the face, lower jaw, neck, esophagus, and larynx. These branches
include the lingual, facial, occipital, maxillary, and superficial temporal arteries. The internal carotid artery initially forms
an expansion known as the carotid sinus, containing the carotid baroreceptors and chemoreceptors.
