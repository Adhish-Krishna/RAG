Figure 14.23 The Sensory Homunculus A cartoon representation of the sensory homunculus arranged adjacent to
the cortical region in which the processing takes place.

 Likewise, the topographic relationship between the retina and the visual cortex is maintained throughout the visual
pathway. The visual field is projected onto the two retinae, as described above, with sorting at the optic chiasm. The right
peripheral visual field falls on the medial portion of the right retina and the lateral portion of the left retina. The right medial
retina then projects across the midline through the optic chiasm. This results in the right visual field being processed in the
left visual cortex. Likewise, the left visual field is processed in the right visual cortex (see Figure 14.22).
