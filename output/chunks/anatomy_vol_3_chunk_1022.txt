The non-heme iron she consumes in plant foods is not as well absorbed as heme
iron. 33 Bilirubin is a breakdown product of the non-iron component of heme, which is cleaved from globin when erythrocytes are
degraded. Excessive erythrocyte destruction would deposit excessive bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is a yellowish pigment, and
high blood levels can manifest as yellowed skin. 34 A neutrophil count below 1800 cells per microliter is considered abnormal.
 Thus, this patientâ€™s ANC is at the low end of the normal range and there would be no reason to delay chemotherapy. In clinical

resulting in leukocytosis. A burn is especially likely to increase the proliferation of leukocytes in order to ward off infection, a
significant risk when the barrier function of the skin is destroyed.
