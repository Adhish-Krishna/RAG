This is achieved by constricting the pulmonary arterioles that serves the dysfunctional alveolus, which redirects
blood to other alveoli that have sufficient ventilation. At the same time, the pulmonary arterioles that serve alveoli receiving
sufficient ventilation vasodilate, which brings in greater blood flow. Factors such as carbon dioxide, oxygen, and pH levels
can all serve as stimuli for adjusting blood flow in the capillary networks associated with the alveoli.

 Ventilation is regulated by the diameter of the airways, whereas perfusion is regulated by the diameter of the blood
vessels. The diameter of the bronchioles is sensitive to the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the alveoli. A greater partial
pressure of carbon dioxide in the alveoli causes the bronchioles to increase their diameter as will a decreased level of oxygen
in the blood supply, allowing carbon dioxide to be exhaled from the body at a greater rate.
