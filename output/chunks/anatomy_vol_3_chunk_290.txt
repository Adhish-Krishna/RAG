The absorptive capacity of the alimentary canal is almost endless. Each day, the

alimentary canal processes up to 10 liters of food, liquids, and GI secretions, yet less than one liter enters the large intestine.
 Almost all ingested food, 80 percent of electrolytes, and 90 percent of water are absorbed in the small intestine. Although
the entire small intestine is involved in the absorption of water and lipids, most absorption of carbohydrates and proteins
occurs in the jejunum. Notably, bile salts and vitamin B12 are absorbed in the terminal ileum. By the time chyme passes
from the ileum into the large intestine, it is essentially indigestible food residue (mainly plant fibers like cellulose), some
water, and millions of bacteria (Figure 23.32).
