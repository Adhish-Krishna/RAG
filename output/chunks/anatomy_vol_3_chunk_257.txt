This mucosa
varies considerably from that of the rest of the colon to accommodate the high level of abrasion as feces pass through. The
anal canalâ€™s mucous membrane is organized into longitudinal folds, each called an anal column, which house a grid of
arteries and veins. Two superficial venous plexuses are found in the anal canal: one within the anal columns and one at the
anus.

 Depressions between the anal columns, each called an anal sinus, secrete mucus that facilitates defecation. The
pectinate line (or dentate line) is a horizontal, jagged band that runs circumferentially just below the level of the anal
sinuses, and represents the junction between the hindgut and external skin. The mucosa above this line is fairly insensitive,
whereas the area below is very sensitive. The resulting difference in pain threshold is due to the fact that the upper region is
innervated by visceral sensory fibers, and the lower region is innervated by somatic sensory fibers.
