The conductive cells within the heart establish the heart rate and transmit it through the myocardium.
 The contractile cells contract and propel the blood. The normal path of transmission for the conductive cells is the sinoatrial

(SA) node, internodal pathways, atrioventricular (AV) node, atrioventricular (AV) bundle of His, bundle branches, and
+

Purkinje fibers. The action potential for the conductive cells consists of a prepotential phase with a slow influx of Na

followed by a rapid influx of Ca** and outflux of K*. Contractile cells have an action potential with an extended plateau
phase that results in an extended refractory period to allow complete contraction for the heart to pump blood effectively.
Recognizable points on the ECG include the P wave that corresponds to atrial depolarization, the QRS complex that
corresponds to ventricular depolarization, and the T wave that corresponds to ventricular repolarization.
