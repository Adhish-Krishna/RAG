One follicle, usually the one with the most FSH receptors,
survives this period and is now called the dominant follicle. The dominant follicle produces more estrogen, triggering
positive feedback and the LH surge that will induce ovulation. Following ovulation, the granulosa cells of the empty follicle
luteinize and transform into the progesterone-producing corpus luteum. The ovulated oocyte with its surrounding granulosa
cells is picked up by the infundibulum of the uterine tube, and beating cilia help to transport it through the tube toward the
uterus. Fertilization occurs within the uterine tube, and the final stage of meiosis is completed.
 The uterus has three regions: the fundus, the body, and the cervix. It has three layers: the outer perimetrium, the
muscular myometrium, and the inner endometrium. The endometrium responds to estrogen released by the follicles during
the menstrual cycle and grows thicker with an increase in blood vessels in preparation for pregnancy.
