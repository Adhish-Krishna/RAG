When T3 and Ta bind to intracellular receptors located
on the mitochondria, they cause an increase in nutrient breakdown and the use of oxygen to produce ATP. In addition, T3
and Ty initiate the transcription of genes involved in glucose oxidation. Although these mechanisms prompt cells to produce
more ATP, the process is inefficient, and an abnormally increased level of heat is released as a byproduct of these reactions.
 This so-called calorigenic effect (calor- = “heat”) raises body temperature.

 Adequate levels of thyroid hormones are also required for protein synthesis and for fetal and childhood tissue
development and growth. They are especially critical for normal development of the nervous system both in utero and in
early childhood, and they continue to support neurological function in adults. As noted earlier, these thyroid hormones
have a complex interrelationship with reproductive hormones, and deficiencies can influence libido, fertility, and other
aspects of reproductive function.
