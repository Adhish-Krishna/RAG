The pneumotaxic center is
a network of neurons that inhibits the activity of neurons in the DRG, allowing relaxation after inspiration, and thus
controlling the overall rate.

 Factors That Affect the Rate and Depth of Respiration

The respiratory rate and the depth of inspiration are regulated by the medulla oblongata and pons; however, these regions
of the brain do so in response to systemic stimuli. It is a dose-response, positive-feedback relationship in which the greater
the stimulus, the greater the response. Thus, increasing stimuli results in forced breathing. Multiple systemic factors are
involved in stimulating the brain to produce pulmonary ventilation.
 The major factor that stimulates the medulla oblongata and pons to produce respiration is surprisingly not oxygen
concentration, but rather the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood. As you recall, carbon dioxide is a waste
product of cellular respiration and can be toxic. Concentrations of chemicals are sensed by chemoreceptors. A central
chemoreceptor is one of the specialized receptors that are located in the brain and brainstem, whereas a peripheral
chemoreceptor is one of the specialized receptors located in the carotid arteries and aortic arch.
