For example, the early disappearance of the anterior fontanelle
and premature closure of the sagittal suture prevents growth across the top of the head. This is compensated by
upward growth by the bones of the lateral skull, resulting in a long, narrow, wedge-shaped head. This condition,
known as scaphocephaly, accounts for approximately 50 percent of craniosynostosis abnormalities. Although the skull
is misshapen, the brain still has adequate room to grow and thus there is no accompanying abnormal neurological
development.

 In cases of complex craniosynostosis, several sutures close prematurely. The amount and degree of skull
deformity is determined by the location and extent of the sutures involved. This results in more severe constraints on
skull growth, which can alter or impede proper brain growth and development.

 Cases of craniosynostosis are usually treated with surgery. A team of physicians will open the skull along the
fused suture, which will then allow the skull bones to resume their growth in this area.
