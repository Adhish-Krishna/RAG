When blood pressure drops, the same smooth muscle cells relax to lower resistance, allowing a continued
even flow of blood.

CHAPTER 25 | THE URINARY SYSTEM 1157

Tubuloglomerular Feedback

The tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism involves the JGA and a paracrine signaling mechanism utilizing ATP,
adenosine, and nitric oxide (NO). This mechanism stimulates either contraction or relaxation of afferent arteriolar smooth
muscle cells (Table 25.8). Recall that the DCT is in intimate contact with the afferent and efferent arterioles of the

glomerulus. Specialized macula densa cells in this segment of the tubule respond to changes in the fluid flow rate and Na*
concentration. As GFR increases, there is less time for NaCl to be reabsorbed in the PCT, resulting in higher osmolarity
in the filtrate. The increased fluid movement more strongly deflects single nonmotile cilia on macula densa cells. This
increased osmolarity of the forming urine, and the greater flow rate within the DCT, activates macula densa cells to respond
by releasing ATP and adenosine (a metabolite of ATP).
