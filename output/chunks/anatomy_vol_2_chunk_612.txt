CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 663

Figure 16.9 Saccadic Eye Movements Saccades are rapid, conjugate movements of the eyes to survey a
complicated visual stimulus, or to follow a moving visual stimulus. This image represents the shifts in gaze typical of
a person studying a face. Notice the concentration of gaze on the major features of the face and the large number of
paths traced between the eyes or around the mouth.

 Testing eye movement is simply a matter of having the patient track the tip of a pen as it is passed through the visual
field. This may appear similar to testing visual field deficits related to the optic nerve, but the difference is that the patient
is asked to not move the eyes while the examiner moves a stimulus into the peripheral visual field.
