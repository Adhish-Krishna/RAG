Due to its structural similarity to aldosterone, progesterone
binds to the aldosterone receptor in the collecting duct of the kidney, causing the same, albeit weaker, effect on Na* and
water retention.

Cardiomyocytes of the atria also respond to greater stretch (as blood pressure rises) by secreting ANH. ANH opposes

the action of aldosterone by inhibiting the recovery of Na* by the DCT and collecting ducts. More Na’ is lost, and as water
follows, total blood volume and pressure decline. In low-pressure states, ANH does not seem to have much effect.

 ADH is also called vasopressin. Early researchers found that in cases of unusually high secretion of ADH, the hormone
caused vasoconstriction (vasopressor activity, hence the name). Only later were its antidiuretic properties identified.
 Synthetic ADH is still used occasionally to stem life-threatening esophagus bleeding in alcoholics.

 When blood volume drops 5—10 percent, causing a decrease in blood pressure, there is a rapid and significant increase
in ADH release from the posterior pituitary.
