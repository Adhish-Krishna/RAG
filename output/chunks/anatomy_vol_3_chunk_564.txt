The arteriolar
myogenic mechanism maintains a steady blood flow by causing arteriolar smooth muscle to contract when blood pressure
increases and causing it to relax when blood pressure decreases. Tubuloglomerular feedback involves paracrine signaling at
the JGA to cause vasoconstriction or vasodilation to maintain a steady rate of blood flow.

 25.8 Endocrine Regulation of Kidney Function

Endocrine hormones act from a distance and paracrine hormones act locally. The renal enzyme renin converts
angiotensinogen into angiotensin I. The lung enzyme, ACE, converts angiotensin I into active angiotensin II. Angiotensin II
is an active vasoconstrictor that increases blood pressure. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone release from the adrenal

cortex, causing the collecting duct to retain Na*, which promotes water retention and a longer-term rise in blood pressure.
 ADH promotes water recovery by the collecting ducts by stimulating the insertion of aquaporin water channels into cell

membranes. Endothelins are elevated in cases of diabetic kidney disease, increasing Na‚Äù retention and decreasing GFR.
