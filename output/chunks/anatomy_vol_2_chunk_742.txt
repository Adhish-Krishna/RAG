This
“packaging” prevents their free diffusion into body cells. When blood levels of T3 and T4 begin to decline, bound T3 and
T4 are released from these plasma proteins and readily cross the membrane of target cells. T3 is more potent than Ta, and
many cells convert T4 to T3 through the removal of an iodine atom.

 Regulation of TH Synthesis

The release of T3 and T4 from the thyroid gland is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). As shown in Figure
17.13, low blood levels of T3 and Ty stimulate the release of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus,
which triggers secretion of TSH from the anterior pituitary. In turn, TSH stimulates the thyroid gland to secrete T3 and T4.
 The levels of TRH, TSH, T3, and Tq are regulated by a negative feedback system in which increasing levels of T3 and T4
decrease the production and secretion of TSH.
