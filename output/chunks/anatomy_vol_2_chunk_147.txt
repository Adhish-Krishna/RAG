Somatic and autonomic integrative
functions may overlap as well.

 A special division of the nervous system is the enteric nervous system, which is responsible for controlling the
digestive organs. Parts of the autonomic nervous system overlap with the enteric nervous system. The enteric nervous
system is exclusively found in the periphery because it is the nervous tissue in the organs of the digestive system.

 12.2 Nervous Tissue

Nervous tissue contains two major cell types, neurons and glial cells. Neurons are the cells responsible for communication
through electrical signals. Glial cells are supporting cells, maintaining the environment around the neurons.

 Neurons are polarized cells, based on the flow of electrical signals along their membrane. Signals are received at the
dendrites, are passed along the cell body, and propagate along the axon towards the target, which may be another neuron,
muscle tissue, or a gland.
