The bottom of each wave, the end of the
relaxation phase, represents the point of stimulus. (b) When the stimulus frequency is so high that the relaxation phase
disappears completely, the contractions become continuous; this is called tetanus.

 If the frequency of motor neuron signaling increases, summation and subsequent muscle tension in the motor unit
continues to rise until it reaches a peak point. The tension at this point is about three to four times greater than the tension of
a single twitch, a state referred to as incomplete tetanus. During incomplete tetanus, the muscle goes through quick cycles of
contraction with a short relaxation phase for each. If the stimulus frequency is so high that the relaxation phase disappears
completely, contractions become continuous in a process called complete tetanus (Figure 10.16b).

 During tetanus, the concentration of Ca** ions in the sarcoplasm allows virtually all of the sarcomeres to form cross-
bridges and shorten, so that a contraction can continue uninterrupted (until the muscle fatigues and can no longer produce
tension).
