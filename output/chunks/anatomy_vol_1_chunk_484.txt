It is not strictly a part of the skin,
although the border between the hypodermis and dermis can be difficult to distinguish. The hypodermis consists of well-
vascularized, loose, areolar connective tissue and adipose tissue, which functions as a mode of fat storage and provides
insulation and cushioning for the integument.

Lipid Storage

The hypodermis is home to most of the fat that concerns people when they are trying to keep their weight under control.
 Adipose tissue present in the hypodermis consists of fat-storing cells called adipocytes. This stored fat can serve as
an energy reserve, insulate the body to prevent heat loss, and act as a cushion to protect underlying structures from
trauma.

 Where the fat is deposited and accumulates within the hypodermis depends on hormones (testosterone, estrogen,
insulin, glucagon, leptin, and others), as well as genetic factors.
