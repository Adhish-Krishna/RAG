Each renal artery branches approximately 2.5 cm inferior to the superior mesenteric arteries and supplies
a kidney. The right renal artery is longer than the left since the aorta lies to the left of the vertebral column and the vesse!
must travel a greater distance to reach its target. Renal arteries branch repeatedly to supply blood to the kidneys. Each
gonadal artery supplies blood to the gonads, or reproductive organs, and is also described as either an ovarian artery or
a testicular artery (internal spermatic), depending upon the sex of the individual. An ovarian artery supplies blood to an
ovary, uterine (Fallopian) tube, and the uterus, and is located within the suspensory ligament of the uterus. It is considerably
shorter than a testicular artery, which ultimately travels outside the body cavity to the testes, forming one component o
the spermatic cord. The gonadal arteries arise inferior to the renal arteries and are generally retroperitoneal. The ovarian
artery continues to the uterus where it forms an anastomosis with the uterine artery that supplies blood to the uterus.
