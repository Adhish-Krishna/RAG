Neurons can also be classified on the basis of where they are found, who found them, what they do, or even what
chemicals they use to communicate with each other. Some neurons referred to in this section on the nervous system are
named on the basis of those sorts of classifications (Figure 12.10). For example, a multipolar neuron that has a very
important role to play in a part of the brain called the cerebellum is known as a Purkinje (commonly pronounced per-KIN-
gee) cell. It is named after the anatomist who discovered it (Jan Evangilista Purkinje, 1787-1869).
