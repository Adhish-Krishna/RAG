Figure 2.16 Acids and Bases (a) In aqueous solution, an acid dissociates into hydrogen ions (H*) and anions. Nearly
every molecule of a strong acid dissociates, producing a high concentration of H*. (b) In aqueous solution, a base
dissociates into hydroxyl ions (OH ) and cations. Nearly every molecule of a strong base dissociates, producing a high
concentration of OH’.

 Bases

A base is a substance that releases hydroxyl ions (OH) in solution, or one that accepts H™ already present in solution (see

Figure 2.16b). The hydroxyl ions or other base combine with H™ present to form a water molecule, thereby removing H*
and reducing the solution’s acidity. Strong bases release most or all of their hydroxyl ions; weak bases release only some

hydroxyl ions or absorb only a few H*.
