In addition to their stimulatory effects on HR, they also
bind to both alpha and beta receptors on the cardiac muscle cell membrane to increase metabolic rate and the force of
contraction. This combination of actions has the net effect of increasing SV and leaving a smaller residual ESV in the
ventricles. In comparison, parasympathetic stimulation releases ACh at the neuromuscular junction from the vagus nerve.
 The membrane hyperpolarizes and inhibits contraction to decrease the strength of contraction and SV, and to raise ESV.
 Since parasympathetic fibers are more widespread in the atria than in the ventricles, the primary site of action is in the upper
chambers. Parasympathetic stimulation in the atria decreases the atrial kick and reduces EDV, which decreases ventricular
stretch and preload, thereby further limiting the force of ventricular contraction. Stronger parasympathetic stimulation also
directly decreases the force of contraction of the ventricles.

 Several synthetic drugs, including dopamine and isoproterenol, have been developed that mimic the effects of
epinephrine and NE by stimulating the influx of calcium ions from the extracellular fluid.
