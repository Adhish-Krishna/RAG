The multipotent hematopoietic stem cells give rise to many different cell types, including the cells of
the immune system and red blood cells.

 Differentiation

When a cell differentiates (becomes more specialized), it may undertake major changes in its size, shape, metabolic activity,
and overall function. Because all cells in the body, beginning with the fertilized egg, contain the same DNA, how do the
different cell types come to be so different? The answer is analogous to a movie script. The different actors in a movie all
read from the same script, however, they are each only reading their own part of the script. Similarly, all cells contain the
same full complement of DNA, but each type of cell only “reads” the portions of DNA that are relevant to its own function.
 In biology, this is referred to as the unique genetic expression of each cell.

 In order for a cell to differentiate into its specialized form and function, it need only manipulate those genes (and thus
those proteins) that will be expressed, and not those that will remain silent.
