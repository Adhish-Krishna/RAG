Septa of the Heart

The word septum is derived from the Latin for “something that encloses;” in this case, a septum (plural = septa) refers to
a wall or partition that divides the heart into chambers. The septa are physical extensions of the myocardium lined with
endocardium. Located between the two atria is the interatrial septum. Normally in an adult heart, the interatrial septum
bears an oval-shaped depression known as the fossa ovalis, a remnant of an opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen
ovale. The foramen ovale allowed blood in the fetal heart to pass directly from the right atrium to the left atrium, allowing
some blood to bypass the pulmonary circuit. Within seconds after birth, a flap of tissue known as the septum primum that
previously acted as a valve closes the foramen ovale and establishes the typical cardiac circulation pattern.
