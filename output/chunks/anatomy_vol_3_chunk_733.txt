There are over 100 related viruses in the HPV family, and the characteristics of
each strain determine the outcome of the infection. In all cases, the virus enters body cells and uses its own genetic
material to take over the host cellâ€™s metabolic machinery and produce more virus particles.

 HPV infections are common in both men and women. Indeed, a recent study determined that 42.5 percent of
females had HPV at the time of testing. These women ranged in age from 14 to 59 years and differed in race, ethnicity,
and number of sexual partners. Of note, the prevalence of HPV infection was 53.8 percent among women aged 20 to
24 years, the age group with the highest infection rate.

 HPV strains are classified as high or low risk according to their potential to cause cancer. Though most HPV
infections do not cause disease, the disruption of normal cellular functions in the low-risk forms of HPV can cause
the male or female human host to develop genital warts.
