However, to flex the knee joint, an opposite or
antagonistic set of muscles called the hamstrings is activated.

 As you can see, these terms would also be reversed for the opposing action. If you consider the first action as the knee
bending, the hamstrings would be called the agonists and the quadriceps femoris would then be called the antagonists. See
Table 11.1 for a list of some agonists and antagonists.

compartment of the arm

Hamstrings: group of three
muscles in the posterior
compartment of the thigh

Antagonist

Triceps brachii: in the
posterior compartment
of the arm
