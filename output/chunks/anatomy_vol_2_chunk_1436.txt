These immune complexes often lodge in the kidneys, joints, and other organs where they can
activate complement proteins and cause inflammation.

CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 957

Delayed (Type IV) Hypersensitivity

Delayed hypersensitivity, or type IV hypersensitivity, is basically a standard cellular immune response. In delayed
hypersensitivity, the first exposure to an antigen is called sensitization, such that on re-exposure, a secondary cellular
response results, secreting cytokines that recruit macrophages and other phagocytes to the site. These sensitized T cells, of
the Th1 class, will also activate cytotoxic T cells. The time it takes for this reaction to occur accounts for the 24- to 72-hour
delay in development.

 The classical test for delayed hypersensitivity is the tuberculin test for tuberculosis, where bacterial proteins from M.
tuberculosis are injected into the skin.
