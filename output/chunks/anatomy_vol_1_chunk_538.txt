Scars occur when there is repair of skin damage. Fibroblasts generate scar tissue in the form of
collagen, which forms a basket-weave pattern that looks different from normal skin.

 Bedsores and stretch marks are the result of excessive pressure on the skin and underlying tissue. Bedsores are
characterized by necrosis of tissue due to immobility, whereas stretch marks result from rapid growth. Eczema is an allergic
reaction that manifests as a rash, and acne results from clogged sebaceous glands. Eczema and acne are usually long-term
skin conditions that may be treated successfully in mild cases. Calluses and corns are the result of abrasive pressure on the
skin.
