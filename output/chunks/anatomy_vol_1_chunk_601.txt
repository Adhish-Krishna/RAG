These hormones
are involved in controlling bone growth, maintaining bone once it is formed, and remodeling it.

 Hormones That Influence Osteoblasts and/or Maintain the Matrix

Several hormones are necessary for controlling bone growth and maintaining the bone matrix. The pituitary gland
secretes growth hormone (GH), which, as its name implies, controls bone growth in several ways. It triggers chondrocyte
proliferation in epiphyseal plates, resulting in the increasing length of long bones. GH also increases calcium retention,
which enhances mineralization, and stimulates osteoblastic activity, which improves bone density.

 GH is not alone in stimulating bone growth and maintaining osseous tissue. Thyroxine, a hormone secreted by the
thyroid gland promotes osteoblastic activity and the synthesis of bone matrix. During puberty, the sex hormones (estrogen in
girls, testosterone in boys) also come into play. They too promote osteoblastic activity and production of bone matrix, and in
addition, are responsible for the growth spurt that often occurs during adolescence.
