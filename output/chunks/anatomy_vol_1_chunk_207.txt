Notice that glycerol gives up a hydrogen atom, and the carboxyl groups on the fatty acids each give up a
hydroxyl group.

 Triglycerides form via dehydration synthesis. Glycerol gives up hydrogen atoms from its hydroxyl groups at each
bond, and the carboxyl group on each fatty acid chain gives up a hydroxy! group. A total of three water molecules are
thereby released.

 Fatty acid chains that have no double carbon bonds anywhere along their length and therefore contain the maximum
number of hydrogen atoms are called saturated fatty acids. These straight, rigid chains pack tightly together and are solid or
semi-solid at room temperature (Figure 2.22a). Butter and lard are examples, as is the fat found on a steak or in your own
body. In contrast, fatty acids with one double carbon bond are kinked at that bond (Figure 2.22b). These monounsaturated
fatty acids are therefore unable to pack together tightly, and are liquid at room temperature.
