There is some variation in wall structure: In a large capillary, several endothelial cells bordering each other
may line the lumen; in a small capillary, there may be only a single cell layer that wraps around to contact itself.

 For capillaries to function, their walls must be leaky, allowing substances to pass through. There are three major types
of capillaries, which differ according to their degree of “leakiness:” continuous, fenestrated, and sinusoid capillaries (Figure
20.5).

 Continuous Capillaries

The most common type of capillary, the continuous capillary, is found in almost all vascularized tissues. Continuous
capillaries are characterized by a complete endothelial lining with tight junctions between endothelial cells. Although a tight
junction is usually impermeable and only allows for the passage of water and ions, they are often incomplete in capillaries,
leaving intercellular clefts that allow for exchange of water and other very small molecules between the blood plasma and
the interstitial fluid.
