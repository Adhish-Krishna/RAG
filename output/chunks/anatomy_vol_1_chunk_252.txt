Explain the structure and contents of the nucleus, as well as the process of DNA replication

¢ Explain the process by which a cell builds proteins using the DNA code

* List the stages of the cell cycle in order, including the steps of cell division in both somatic cells

* Discuss how a cell differentiates and becomes more specialized

¢ List the morphological and physiological characteristics of some representative cell types in the human body

You developed from a single fertilized egg cell into the complex organism containing trillions of cells that you see when
you look in a mirror. During this developmental process, early, undifferentiated cells differentiate and become specialized
in their structure and function. These different cell types form specialized tissues that work in concert to perform all of the
functions necessary for the living organism. Cellular and developmental biologists study how the continued division of a
single cell leads to such complexity and differentiation.

Consider the difference between a structural cell in the skin and a nerve cell.
