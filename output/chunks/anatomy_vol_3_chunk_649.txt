Urine produced by the kidneys accounts for the largest amount of water leaving the body. The kidneys
can adjust the concentration of the urine to reflect the bodyâ€™s water needs, conserving water if the body is dehydrated or
making urine more dilute to expel excess water when necessary. ADH is a hormone that helps the body to retain water by
increasing water reabsorption by the kidneys.

 26.3 Electrolyte Balance

Electrolytes serve various purposes, such as helping to conduct electrical impulses along cell membranes in neurons and
muscles, stabilizing enzyme structures, and releasing hormones from endocrine glands. The ions in plasma also contribute to
the osmotic balance that controls the movement of water between cells and their environment. Imbalances of these ions can
result in various problems in the body, and their concentrations are tightly regulated. Aldosterone and angiotensin II control
the exchange of sodium and potassium between the renal filtrate and the renal collecting tubule. Calcium and phosphate are
regulated by PTH, calcitrol, and calcitonin.
