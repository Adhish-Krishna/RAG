The lingual tonsil is
located at the base of the tongue. Similar to the pharyngeal tonsil, the palatine and lingual tonsils are composed of lymphoid
tissue, and trap and destroy pathogens entering the body through the oral or nasal cavities.

 The laryngopharynx is inferior to the oropharynx and posterior to the larynx. It continues the route for ingested
material and air until its inferior end, where the digestive and respiratory systems diverge. The stratified squamous
epithelium of the oropharynx is continuous with the laryngopharynx. Anteriorly, the laryngopharynx opens into the larynx,
whereas posteriorly, it enters the esophagus.

 Larynx

The larynx is a cartilaginous structure inferior to the laryngopharynx that connects the pharynx to the trachea and helps
regulate the volume of air that enters and leaves the lungs (Figure 22.7). The structure of the larynx is formed by several
pieces of cartilage. Three large cartilage pieces—the thyroid cartilage (anterior), epiglottis (superior), and cricoid cartilage
(inferior)—form the major structure of the larynx.
