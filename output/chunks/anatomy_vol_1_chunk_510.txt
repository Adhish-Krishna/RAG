 Thermoregulation

The integumentary system helps regulate body temperature through its tight association with the sympathetic nervous
system, the division of the nervous system involved in our fight-or-flight responses. The sympathetic nervous system is
continuously monitoring body temperature and initiating appropriate motor responses. Recall that sweat glands, accessory
structures to the skin, secrete water, salt, and other substances to cool the body when it becomes warm. Even when the body
does not appear to be noticeably sweating, approximately 500 mL of sweat (insensible perspiration) are secreted a day. If
the body becomes excessively warm due to high temperatures, vigorous activity (Figure 5.16ac), or a combination of the
two, sweat glands will be stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system to produce large amounts of sweat, as much as 0.7
to 1.5 L per hour for an active person.
