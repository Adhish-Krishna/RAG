The body
coordinates its functions through two major types of communication: neural and endocrine. Neural communication includes
both electrical and chemical signaling between neurons and target cells. Endocrine communication involves chemical
signaling via the release of hormones into the extracellular fluid. From there, hormones diffuse into the bloodstream and
may travel to distant body regions, where they elicit a response in target cells. Endocrine glands are ductless glands that
secrete hormones. Many organs of the body with other primary functions—such as the heart, stomach, and kidneys—also
have hormone-secreting cells.

17.2 Hormones

Hormones are derived from amino acids or lipids. Amine hormones originate from the amino acids tryptophan or tyrosine.
 Larger amino acid hormones include peptides and protein hormones. Steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol.
 Steroid hormones and thyroid hormone are lipid soluble. All other amino acid—derived hormones are water soluble.
 Hydrophobic hormones are able to diffuse through the membrane and interact with an intracellular receptor.
