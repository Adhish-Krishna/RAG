Inflammation limits the extent of injury, partially or
fully eliminates the cause of injury, and initiates repair and regeneration of damaged tissue. Necrosis, or accidental cell
death, causes inflammation. Apoptosis is programmed cell death, a normal step-by-step process that destroys cells no longer
needed by the body. By mechanisms still under investigation, apoptosis does not initiate the inflammatory response. Acute
inflammation resolves over time by the healing of tissue. If inflammation persists, it becomes chronic and leads to diseased
conditions. Arthritis and tuberculosis are examples of chronic inflammation. The suffix “-itis” denotes inflammation of
a specific organ or type, for example, peritonitis is the inflammation of the peritoneum, and meningitis refers to the
inflammation of the meninges, the tough membranes that surround the central nervous system
The four cardinal signs of inflammation—redness, swelling, pain, and local heat—were first recorded in antiquity.
