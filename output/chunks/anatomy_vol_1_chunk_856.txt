The inferior pubic ramus joins the ischial ramus to form the ischiopubic ramus. The subpubic angle
is formed by the medial convergence of the right and left ischiopubic rami.
 The lateral side of the hip bone has the cup-like acetabulum, which is part of the hip joint. The large anterior opening
is the obturator foramen. The sacroiliac joint is supported by the anterior and posterior sacroiliac ligaments. The sacrum is
also joined to the hip bone by the sacrospinous ligament, which attaches to the ischial spine, and the sacrotuberous ligament,
which attaches to the ischial tuberosity. The sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments contribute to the formation of the
greater and lesser sciatic foramina.
 The broad space of the upper pelvis is the greater pelvis, and the narrow, inferior space is the lesser pelvis. These areas
are separated by the pelvic brim (pelvic inlet). The inferior opening of the pelvis is the pelvic outlet. Compared to the male,
the female pelvis is wider to accommodate childbirth, has a larger subpubic angle, and a broader greater sciatic notch.
