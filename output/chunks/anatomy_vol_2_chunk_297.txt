The
somatic nervous system is responsible for our conscious perception of the environment and for our voluntary responses

to that perception by means of skeletal muscles. Peripheral sensory neurons receive input from environmental stimuli, but
the neurons that produce motor responses originate in the central nervous system. The distinction between the structures
(i.e., anatomy) of the peripheral and central nervous systems and functions (i.e., physiology) of the somatic and autonomic
systems can most easily be demonstrated through a simple reflex action. When you touch a hot stove, you pull your hand
away. Sensory receptors in the skin sense extreme temperature and the early signs of tissue damage. This triggers an action
potential, which travels along the sensory fiber from the skin, through the dorsal spinal root to the spinal cord, and directly
activates a ventral horn motor neuron.
