35 This blood pressure is insufficient to circulate blood throughout the patient’s
body and maintain adequate perfusion of the patient’s tissues. Ischemia would prompt hypoxia, including to the brain, prompting
confusion. The low blood pressure would also trigger the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone mechanism, and release of aldosterone
would stimulate the thirst mechanism in the hypothalamus. 36 Nitric oxide is a very powerful local vasodilator that is important
in the autoregulation of tissue perfusion. If it were not broken down very quickly after its release, blood flow to the region could
exceed metabolic needs. 37 The right ventricle of the heart pumps oxygen-depleted blood to the pulmonary arteries. 38 The
gonadal veins drain the testes in males and the ovaries in females. 39 The internal carotid arteries and the vertebral arteries provide
most of the brain’s blood supply. 40 Angiogenesis inhibitors are drugs that inhibit the growth of new blood vessels. They can
impede the growth of tumors by limiting their blood supply and therefore their access to gas and nutrient exchange.
