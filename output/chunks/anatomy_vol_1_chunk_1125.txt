Brachioradialis

Figure 11.2 Prime Movers and Synergists_ The biceps brachii flex the lower arm. The brachoradialis, in the forearm,
and brachialis, located deep to the biceps in the upper arm, are both synergists that aid in this motion.

 A muscle with the opposite action of the prime mover is called an antagonist. Antagonists play two important roles in
muscle function: (1) they maintain body or limb position, such as holding the arm out or standing erect; and (2) they control
rapid movement, as in shadow boxing without landing a punch or the ability to check the motion of a limb.

 For example, to extend the knee, a group of four muscles called the quadriceps femoris in the anterior compartment of
the thigh are activated (and would be called the agonists of knee extension).
