Embryonic Origin of Tissues

The zygote, or fertilized egg, is a single cell formed by the fusion of an egg and sperm. After fertilization the zygote gives
rise to rapid mitotic cycles, generating many cells to form the embryo. The first embryonic cells generated have the ability
to differentiate into any type of cell in the body and, as such, are called totipotent, meaning each has the capacity to divide,
differentiate, and develop into a new organism. As cell proliferation progresses, three major cell lineages are established
within the embryo. Each of these lineages of embryonic cells forms the distinct germ layers from which all the tissues
and organs of the human body eventually form.
