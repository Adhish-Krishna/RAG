It is noteworthy that
these diseases are largely age-related. Many scientists believe that oxidative stress is a major contributor to the aging
process.

 Cell: The Free Radical Theory

The free radical theory on aging was originally proposed in the 1950s, and still remains under debate. Generally
speaking, the free radical theory of aging suggests that accumulated cellular damage from oxidative stress contributes
to the physiological and anatomical effects of aging. There are two significantly different versions of this theory: one
states that the aging process itself is a result of oxidative damage, and the other states that oxidative damage causes age-
related disease and disorders. The latter version of the theory is more widely accepted than the former. However, many
lines of evidence suggest that oxidative damage does contribute to the aging process. Research has shown that reducing
oxidative damage can result in a longer lifespan in certain organisms such as yeast, worms, and fruit flies.
