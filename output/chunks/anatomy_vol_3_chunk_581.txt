which surrounds cells that are not blood cells.

 Extracellular Fluid

The ECF accounts for the other one-third of the body’s water content. Approximately 20 percent of the ECF is found in
plasma. Plasma travels through the body in blood vessels and transports a range of materials, including blood cells, proteins
(including clotting factors and antibodies), electrolytes, nutrients, gases, and wastes. Gases, nutrients, and waste materials
travel between capillaries and cells through the IF. Cells are separated from the IF by a selectively permeable cell membrane
that helps regulate the passage of materials between the IF and the interior of the cell.
