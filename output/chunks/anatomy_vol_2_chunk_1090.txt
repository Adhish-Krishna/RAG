Increases end diastolic volume, Decreases end systolic volume, | Increases end systolic volume
Increases stroke volume Increases stroke volume Decreases stroke volume
Lowered | Â«decreased thyroid hormones * parasympathetic stimulation * decreased vascular resistance
due to: * decreased calcium ions * acetylcholine
* high or low potassium ions * hypoxia
* high or low sodium * hyperkalemia
* low body temperature
* hypoxia
* abnormal pH balance

Figure 19.34 Major Factors Influencing Stroke Volume Multiple factors impact preload, afterload, and contractility,
and are the major considerations influencing SV.
