T-tubules are not required to reach the interior of the cell and therefore not necessary to
transmit an action potential deep into the fiber. Smooth muscle fibers have a limited calcium-storing SR but have calcium
channels in the sarcolemma (similar to cardiac muscle fibers) that open during the action potential along the sarcolemma.

 The influx of extracellular Ca** ions, which diffuse into the sarcoplasm to reach the calmodulin, accounts for most of the
Caâ€˜* that triggers contraction of a smooth muscle cell.

 Muscle contraction continues until ATP-dependent calcium pumps actively transport Ca** ions back into the SR and
out of the cell. However, a low concentration of calcium remains in the sarcoplasm to maintain muscle tone. This remaining
calcium keeps the muscle slightly contracted, which is important in certain tracts and around blood vessels.

 Because most smooth muscles must function for long periods without rest, their power output is relatively low, but
contractions can continue without using large amounts of energy.
