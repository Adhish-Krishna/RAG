32 These four phenomena are similar
in the sense that they describe the movement of substances down a particular type of gradient. Osmosis and diffusion involve
the movement of water and other substances down their concentration gradients, respectively. Filtration describes the movement
of particles down a pressure gradient, and the movement of ions away from like charge describes their movement down their
electrical gradient. 33 The structure of the Golgi apparatus is suited to its function because it is a series of flattened membranous
discs; substances are modified and packaged in sequential steps as they travel from one disc to the next. The structure of Golgi
apparatus also involves a receiving face and a sending face, which organize cellular products as they enter and leave the Golgi
apparatus. The ER and the mitochondria both have structural specializations that increase their surface area. In the mitochondria,
the inner membrane is extensively folded, which increases surface area for ATP production. Likewise, the ER is elaborately

wound throughout the cell, increasing its surface area for functions like lipid synthesis, Ca** storage, and protein synthesis.
