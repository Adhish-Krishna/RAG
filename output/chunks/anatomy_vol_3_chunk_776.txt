Contact Between Sperm and Oocyte

Upon ovulation, the oocyte released by the ovary is swept into—and along—the uterine tube. Fertilization must occur in
the distal uterine tube because an unfertilized oocyte cannot survive the 72-hour journey to the uterus. As you will recall
from your study of the oogenesis, this oocyte (specifically a secondary oocyte) is surrounded by two protective layers. The
corona radiata is an outer layer of follicular (granulosa) cells that form around a developing oocyte in the ovary and remain
with it upon ovulation. The underlying zona pellucida (pellucid = “transparent”) is a transparent, but thick, glycoprotein
membrane that surrounds the cell’s plasma membrane.

 As it is swept along the distal uterine tube, the oocyte encounters the surviving capacitated sperm, which stream toward
it in response to chemical attractants released by the cells of the corona radiata.
