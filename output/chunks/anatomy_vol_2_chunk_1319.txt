The lymphatic system, for most people, is associated with the immune system to such a
degree that the two systems are virtually indistinguishable. The lymphatic system is the system of vessels, cells, and organs
that carries excess fluids to the bloodstream and filters pathogens from the blood. The swelling of lymph nodes during an
infection and the transport of lymphocytes via the lymphatic vessels are but two examples of the many connections between
these critical organ systems.

 Functions of the Lymphatic System

A major function of the lymphatic system is to drain body fluids and return them to the bloodstream. Blood pressure causes
leakage of fluid from the capillaries, resulting in the accumulation of fluid in the interstitial spaceâ€”that is, spaces between
individual cells in the tissues. In humans, 20 liters of plasma is released into the interstitial space of the tissues each day
due to capillary filtration. Once this filtrate is out of the bloodstream and in the tissue spaces, it is referred to as interstitial
fluid.
