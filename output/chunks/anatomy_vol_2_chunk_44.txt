Visit the Nobel
Prize web site (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/nobel_2) to play an interactive game that demonstrates the use of this
technology and compares it with other types of imaging technologies. Also, the results from an MRI session are
compared with images obtained from X-ray or computed tomography. How do the imaging techniques shown in this
game indicate the separation of white and gray matter compared with the freshly dissected tissue shown earlier?
