Like all catalysts, enzymes work by lowering
the level of energy that needs to be invested in a chemical reaction. A chemical reaction’s activation energy is the
“threshold” level of energy needed to break the bonds in the reactants. Once those bonds are broken, new arrangements can
form. Without an enzyme to act as a catalyst, a much larger investment of energy is needed to ignite a chemical reaction
(Figure 2.13).
