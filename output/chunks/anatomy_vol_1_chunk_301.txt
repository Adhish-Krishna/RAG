Conversely,
increasing oxidative damage can shorten the lifespan of mice and worms. Interestingly, a manipulation called calorie-
restriction (moderately restricting the caloric intake) has been shown to increase life span in some laboratory animals.
 It is believed that this increase is at least in part due to a reduction of oxidative stress. However, a long-term study
of primates with calorie-restriction showed no increase in their lifespan. A great deal of additional research will be
required to better understand the link between reactive oxygen species and aging.

 The Cytoskeleton

Much like the bony skeleton structurally supports the human body, the cytoskeleton helps the cells to maintain their
structural integrity. The cytoskeleton is a group of fibrous proteins that provide structural support for cells, but this is only
one of the functions of the cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal components are also critical for cell motility, cell reproduction, and
transportation of substances within the cell.
