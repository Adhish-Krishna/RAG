ATP and adenosine act locally as paracrine factors to stimulate the
myogenic juxtaglomerular cells of the afferent arteriole to constrict, slowing blood flow and reducing GFR. Conversely,
when GFR decreases, less Naâ€™ is in the forming urine, and most will be reabsorbed before reaching the macula densa, which
will result in decreased ATP and adenosine, allowing the afferent arteriole to dilate and increase GFR. NO has the opposite
effect, relaxing the afferent arteriole at the same time ATP and adenosine are stimulating it to contract. Thus, NO fine-tunes
the effects of adenosine and ATP on GFR.
