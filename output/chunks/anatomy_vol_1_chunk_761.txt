The large range of upper limb movements, coupled with the ability to easily

manipulate objects with our hands and opposable thumbs, has allowed humans to construct the modern world in which we
live.

 8.1 | The Pectoral Girdle

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the bones that form the pectoral girdle
¢ List the functions of the pectoral girdle

The appendicular skeleton includes all of the limb bones, plus the bones that unite each limb with the axial skeleton (Figure
8.2). The bones that attach each upper limb to the axial skeleton form the pectoral girdle (shoulder girdle). This consists of
two bones, the scapula and clavicle (Figure 8.3). The clavicle (collarbone) is an S-shaped bone located on the anterior side
of the shoulder. It is attached on its medial end to the sternum of the thoracic cage, which is part of the axial skeleton.
