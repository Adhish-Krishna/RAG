Embryonic males and females, though
genetically distinguishable, are morphologically identical (Figure 28.16). Bipotential gonads, or gonads that can develop
into male or female sexual organs, are connected to a central cavity called the cloaca via Miillerian ducts and Wolffian ducts.
 (The cloaca is an extension of the primitive gut.) Several events lead to sexual differentiation during this period.

 During male fetal development, the bipotential gonads become the testes and associated epididymis. The Miillerian
ducts degenerate. The Wolffian ducts become the vas deferens, and the cloaca becomes the urethra and rectum.

 During female fetal development, the bipotential gonads develop into ovaries. The Wolffian ducts degenerate. The
Miillerian ducts become the uterine tubes and uterus, and the cloaca divides and develops into a vagina, a urethra, and a
rectum.
