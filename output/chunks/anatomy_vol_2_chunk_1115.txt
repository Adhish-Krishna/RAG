Figure 20.2 Cardiovascular Circulation The pulmonary circuit moves blood from the right side of the heart to the
lungs and back to the heart. The systemic circuit moves blood from the left side of the heart to the head and body and
returns it to the right side of the heart to repeat the cycle. The arrows indicate the direction of blood flow, and the colors
show the relative levels of oxygen concentration.

 Shared Structures

Different types of blood vessels vary slightly in their structures, but they share the same general features. Arteries and
arterioles have thicker walls than veins and venules because they are closer to the heart and receive blood that is surging at
a far greater pressure (Figure 20.3). Each type of vessel has a lumenâ€”a hollow passageway through which blood flows.
 Arteries have smaller lumens than veins, a characteristic that helps to maintain the pressure of blood moving through the
system.
