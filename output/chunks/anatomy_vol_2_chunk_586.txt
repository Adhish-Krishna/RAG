Will hitting the snooze button multiple times lead to feeling more rested or result in a panic as you run late? How
you mentally process these questions can affect your whole day.

 The prefrontal cortex is responsible for the functions responsible for planning and making decisions. In the mental
status exam, the subtest that assesses judgment and reasoning is directed at three aspects of frontal lobe function. First, the
examiner asks questions about problem solving, such as “If you see a house on fire, what would you do?” The patient is
also asked to interpret common proverbs, such as “Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth.” Additionally, pairs of words are
compared for similarities, such as apple and orange, or lamp and cabinet.

 The prefrontal cortex is composed of the regions of the frontal lobe that are not directly related to specific motor
functions. The most posterior region of the frontal lobe, the precentral gyrus, is the primary motor cortex.
