Nervous % 20Tissue/065-2_HISTO_40X.svs/view.apml (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/spinalroot) to explore the
tissue sample in greater detail. If you zoom in on the dorsal root ganglion, you can see smaller satellite glial
cells surrounding the large cell bodies of the sensory neurons. From what structure do satellite cells derive during
embryologic development?

 Another type of sensory ganglion is a cranial nerve ganglion. This is analogous to the dorsal root ganglion, except
that it is associated with a cranial nerve instead of a spinal nerve. The roots of cranial nerves are within the cranium,
whereas the ganglia are outside the skull. For example, the trigeminal ganglion is superficial to the temporal bone whereas
its associated nerve is attached to the mid-pons region of the brain stem.
