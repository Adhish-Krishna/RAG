The glomerulus and Bowmanâ€™s capsule together form the renal corpuscle.
As mentioned earlier, these glomerular capillaries filter the blood based on particle size. After passing through the renal
corpuscle, the capillaries form a second arteriole, the efferent arteriole (Figure 25.10). These will next form a capillary
network around the more distal portions of the nephron tubule, the peritubular capillaries and vasa recta, before returning
to the venous system. As the glomerular filtrate progresses through the nephron, these capillary networks recover most of
the solutes and water, and return them to the circulation. Since a capillary bed (the glomerulus) drains into a vessel that
in turn forms a second capillary bed, the definition of a portal system is met. This is the only portal system in which an
arteriole is found between the first and second capillary beds. (Portal systems also link the hypothalamus to the anterior
pituitary, and the blood vessels of the digestive viscera to the liver.)
