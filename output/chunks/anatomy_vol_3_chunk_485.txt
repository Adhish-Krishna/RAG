Failure of the renal anatomy and/or physiology can lead suddenly or gradually to renal failure. In this event, a number
of symptoms, signs, or laboratory findings point to the diagnosis (Table 25.3).

 Symptoms of Kidney Failure

Weakness

Lethargy

Shortness of breath
Widespread edema

Anemia

Metabolic acidosis

Metabolic alkalosis

Heart arrhythmias

Uremia (high urea level in the blood)

 Loss of appetite

Fatigue

Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)

 The volume of filtrate formed by both kidneys per minute is termed the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The heart pumps
about 5 L blood per min under resting conditions. Approximately 20 percent or one liter enters the kidneys to be filtered.
 On average, this liter results in the production of about 125 mL/min filtrate produced in men (range of 90 to 140 mL/min)
and 105 mL/min filtrate produced in women (range of 80 to 125 mL/min).
