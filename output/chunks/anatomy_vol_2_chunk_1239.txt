As it passes through the thoracic region, the thoracic
aorta gives rise to several branches, which are collectively referred to as visceral branches and parietal branches (Figure
20.28). Those branches that supply blood primarily to visceral organs are known as the visceral branches and include
the bronchial arteries, pericardial arteries, esophageal arteries, and the mediastinal arteries, each named after the tissues
it supplies. Each bronchial artery (typically two on the left and one on the right) supplies systemic blood to the lungs

and visceral pleura, in addition to the blood pumped to the lungs for oxygenation via the pulmonary circuit. The bronchial
arteries follow the same path as the respiratory branches, beginning with the bronchi and ending with the bronchioles. There
is considerable, but not total, intermingling of the systemic and pulmonary blood at anastomoses in the smaller branches of
the lungs.
