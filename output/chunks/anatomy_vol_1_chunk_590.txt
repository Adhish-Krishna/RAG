6.5 | Fractures: Bone Repair

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Differentiate among the different types of fractures
¢ Describe the steps involved in bone repair

A fracture is a broken bone. It will heal whether or not a physician resets it in its anatomical position. If the bone is not
reset correctly, the healing process will keep the bone in its deformed position.

 When a broken bone is manipulated and set into its natural position without surgery, the procedure is called a closed
reduction. Open reduction requires surgery to expose the fracture and reset the bone. While some fractures can be minor,
others are quite severe and result in grave complications. For example, a fractured diaphysis of the femur has the potential to
release fat globules into the bloodstream. These can become lodged in the capillary beds of the lungs, leading to respiratory
distress and if not treated quickly, death.
