In these
circumstances, medics may at least try to replace some of the volume of blood that has been lost. This is done by intravenous
administration of a saline solution that provides fluids and electrolytes in proportions equivalent to those of normal blood
plasma. Research is ongoing to develop a safe and effective artificial blood that would carry out the oxygen-carrying
function of blood without the RBCs, enabling transfusions in the field without concern for incompatibility. These blood
substitutes normally contain hemoglobin- as well as perfluorocarbon-based oxygen carriers.
