The Breasts

Whereas the breasts are located far from the other female reproductive organs, they are considered accessory organs of the
female reproductive system. The function of the breasts is to supply milk to an infant in a process called lactation. The
external features of the breast include a nipple surrounded by a pigmented areola (Figure 27.17), whose coloration may
deepen during pregnancy. The areola is typically circular and can vary in size from 25 to 100 mm in diameter. The areolar
region is characterized by small, raised areolar glands that secrete lubricating fluid during lactation to protect the nipple
from chafing. When a baby nurses, or draws milk from the breast, the entire areolar region is taken into the mouth.

 Breast milk is produced by the mammary glands, which are modified sweat glands. The milk itself exits the breast
through the nipple via 15 to 20 lactiferous ducts that open on the surface of the nipple.
