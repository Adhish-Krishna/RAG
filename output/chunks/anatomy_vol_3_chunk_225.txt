For example, when your sushi reaches the stomach, it creates distention
that activates the stretch receptors. This stimulates parasympathetic neurons to release acetylcholine, which then provokes
increased secretion of gastric juice. Partially digested proteins, caffeine, and rising pH stimulate the release of gastrin from
enteroendocrine G cells, which in turn induces parietal cells to increase their production of HCl, which is needed to create
an acidic environment for the conversion of pepsinogen to pepsin, and protein digestion. Additionally, the release of gastrin
activates vigorous smooth muscle contractions. However, it should be noted that the stomach does have a natural means of
avoiding excessive acid secretion and potential heartburn. Whenever pH levels drop too low, cells in the stomach react by
suspending HCI secretion and increasing mucous secretions.

 The intestinal phase of gastric secretion has both excitatory and inhibitory elements. The duodenum has a major role
in regulating the stomach and its emptying. When partially digested food fills the duodenum, intestinal mucosal cells release
a hormone called intestinal (enteric) gastrin, which further excites gastric juice secretion.
