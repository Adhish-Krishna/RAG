The two types have different locations in the body and have different characteristics. Single-unit muscle has
its muscle fibers joined by gap junctions so that the muscle contracts as a single unit. This type of smooth muscle is found
in the walls of all visceral organs except the heart (which has cardiac muscle in its walls), and so it is commonly called
visceral muscle. Because the muscle fibers are not constrained by the organization and stretchability limits of sarcomeres,
visceral smooth muscle has a stress-relaxation response. This means that as the muscle of a hollow organ is stretched when
it fills, the mechanical stress of the stretching will trigger contraction, but this is immediately followed by relaxation so
that the organ does not empty its contents prematurely. This is important for hollow organs, such as the stomach or urinary
bladder, which continuously expand as they fill. The smooth muscle around these organs also can maintain a muscle tone
when the organ empties and shrinks, a feature that prevents “flabbiness” in the empty organ.
