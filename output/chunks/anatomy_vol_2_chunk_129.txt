All synapses have common
characteristics, which can be summarized in this list:

presynaptic element

neurotransmitter (packaged in vesicles)

synaptic cleft

receptor proteins

postsynaptic element

neurotransmitter elimination or re-uptake

For the NMJ, these characteristics are as follows: the presynaptic element is the motor neuron's axon terminals, the

neurotransmitter is acetylcholine, the synaptic cleft is the space between the cells where the neurotransmitter diffuses, the
receptor protein is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, the postsynaptic element is the sarcolemma of the muscle cell, and

the neurotransmitter is eliminated by acetylcholinesterase.
