This arrangement traps heat closer to the body core
and restricts heat loss. If heat loss is severe, the brain triggers an increase in random signals to skeletal muscles, causing
them to contract and producing shivering. The muscle contractions of shivering release heat while using up ATP. The brain
triggers the thyroid gland in the endocrine system to release thyroid hormone, which increases metabolic activity and heat
production in cells throughout the body. The brain also signals the adrenal glands to release epinephrine (adrenaline), a
hormone that causes the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, which can be used as an energy source. The breakdown of
glycogen into glucose also results in increased metabolism and heat production.

Water concentration in the body is critical for proper functioning. A personâ€™s body retains very tight control on water
levels without conscious control by the person. Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/H2Ocon) to learn more
about water concentration in the body.
