The portal triad is a distinctive arrangement around the perimeter of hepatic
lobules, consisting of three basic structures: a bile duct, a hepatic artery branch, and a hepatic portal vein branch.

 Bile

Recall that lipids are hydrophobic, that is, they do not dissolve in water. Thus, before they can be digested in the watery
environment of the small intestine, large lipid globules must be broken down into smaller lipid globules, a process called
emulsification. Bile is a mixture secreted by the liver to accomplish the emulsification of lipids in the small intestine.
 Hepatocytes secrete about one liter of bile each day. A yellow-brown or yellow-green alkaline solution (pH 7.6 to
8.6), bile is a mixture of water, bile salts, bile pigments, phospholipids (such as lecithin), electrolytes, cholesterol, and
triglycerides.
