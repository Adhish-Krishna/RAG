Poor health,
including smoking, can lead to earlier loss of fertility and earlier menopause.

 As a woman reaches the age of menopause, depletion of the number of viable follicles in the ovaries due to atresia
affects the hormonal regulation of the menstrual cycle. During the years leading up to menopause, there is a decrease in
the levels of the hormone inhibin, which normally participates in a negative feedback loop to the pituitary to control the
production of FSH. The menopausal decrease in inhibin leads to an increase in FSH. The presence of FSH stimulates
more follicles to grow and secrete estrogen. Because small, secondary follicles also respond to increases in FSH levels,
larger numbers of follicles are stimulated to grow; however, most undergo atresia and die. Eventually, this process
leads to the depletion of all follicles in the ovaries, and the production of estrogen falls off dramatically. It is primarily
the lack of estrogens that leads to the symptoms of menopause.
