38 Identical atoms
have identical electronegativity and cannot form ionic bonds. Oxygen, for example, has six electrons in its valence shell. Neither
donating nor accepting the valence shell electrons of the other will result in the oxygen atoms completing their valence shells. Two
atoms of the same element always form covalent bonds. 39 It is not. An exchange reaction might be AB +CD > AC + BD or

AB +CD > AD+BC. In all chemical reactions, including exchange reactions, the components of the reactants are identical

to the components of the products. A component present among the reactants cannot disappear, nor can a component not present
in the reactants suddenly appear in the products. 40 Recall that the greater the surface area of the reactants, the more quickly and
easily they will interact. It takes energy to separate particles of a substance. Powder and liquid laundry detergents, with relatively
more surface area per unit, can quickly dissolve into their reactive components when added to the water.
