Méniére's disease is
a disorder that can affect both equilibrium and audition in a variety of ways. The patient can suffer from vertigo, a low-
frequency ringing in the ears, or a loss of hearing. From patient to patient, the exact presentation of the disease can be
different. Additionally, within a single patient, the symptoms and signs may change as the disease progresses. Use of the
neurological exam subtests for the vestibulocochlear nerve illuminates the changes a patient may go through. The disease
appears to be the result of accumulation, or over-production, of fluid in the inner ear, in either the vestibule or cochlea.

Tests of equilibrium are important for coordination and gait and are related to other aspects of the neurological exam.
 The vestibulo-ocular reflex involves the cranial nerves for gaze control. Balance and equilibrium, as tested by the Romberg
test, are part of spinal and cerebellar processes and involved in those components of the neurological exam, as discussed
later.
