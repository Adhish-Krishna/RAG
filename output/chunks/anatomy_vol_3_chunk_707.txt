Because of the
spontaneous mutations in mtDNA that have occurred over the centuries, researchers can map different “branches” off
of the “main trunk” of our mtDNA family tree. Your mtDNA might have a pattern of mutations that aligns more closely
with one branch, and your neighbor’s may align with another branch. Still, all branches eventually lead back to Eve.

 But what happened to the mtDNA of all of the other Homo sapiens females who were living at the time of Eve?
 Researchers explain that, over the centuries, their female descendants died childless or with only male children, and
thus, their maternal line—and its mtDNA—ended.

 Folliculogenesis

Again, ovarian follicles are oocytes and their supporting cells. They grow and develop in a process called folliculogenesis,
which typically leads to ovulation of one follicle approximately every 28 days, along with death to multiple other follicles.
