Because carbon dioxide is released from the lungs, blood that leaves
the lungs and reaches body tissues has a lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide than is found in the tissues. As a result,
carbon dioxide leaves the tissues because of its higher partial pressure, enters the blood, and then moves into red blood cells,
binding to hemoglobin. In contrast, in the pulmonary capillaries, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is high compared
to within the alveoli. As a result, carbon dioxide dissociates readily from hemoglobin and diffuses across the respiratory
membrane into the air.

 In addition to the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin and the partial pressure of
oxygen in the blood also influence the affinity of hemoglobin for carbon dioxide. The Haldane effect is a phenomenon
that arises from the relationship between the partial pressure of oxygen and the affinity of hemoglobin for carbon dioxide.
