The muscles of the
upper and lower face need to be tested. The strength test
in this video involves the patient squeezing her eyes shut
and the examiner trying to pry her eyes open. Why does the
examiner ask her to try a second time?

6. Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/2point)
to see a quick demonstration of two-point discrimination.
 Touching a specialized caliper to the surface of the skin will
measure the distance between two points that are perceived
as distinct stimuli versus a single stimulus. The patient keeps
their eyes closed while the examiner switches between using
both points of the caliper or just one. The patient then must
indicate whether one or two stimuli are in contact with the
skin. Why is the distance between the caliper points closer
on the fingertips as opposed to the palm of the hand? And
what do you think the distance would be on the arm, or the
shoulder?
