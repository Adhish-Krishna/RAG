Two important regions that assist in planning and coordinating movements are located adjacent to the primary motor
cortex. The premotor cortex is more lateral, whereas the supplemental motor area is more medial and superior. The premotor
area aids in controlling movements of the core muscles to maintain posture during movement, whereas the supplemental
motor area is hypothesized to be responsible for planning and coordinating movement. The supplemental motor area also
manages sequential movements that are based on prior experience (that is, learned movements). Neurons in these areas are
most active leading up to the initiation of movement. For example, these areas might prepare the body for the movements
necessary to drive a car in anticipation of a traffic light changing.

 Adjacent to these two regions are two specialized motor planning centers. The frontal eye fields are responsible for
moving the eyes in response to visual stimuli. There are direct connections between the frontal eye fields and the superior
colliculus. Also, anterior to the premotor cortex and primary motor cortex is Brocaâ€™s area.
