The lymph can only go in
one direction due to valves in the vessels. The larger lymphatics merge to form trunks that enter into the blood via lymphatic
ducts. 40 The cell debris and damaged cells induce macrophages to begin to clean them up. Macrophages release cytokines that
attract neutrophils, followed by more macrophages. Other mediators released by mast cells increase blood flow to the area and
also vascular permeability, allowing the recruited cells to get from the blood to the site of infection, where they can phagocytose
the dead cells and debris, preparing the site for wound repair. 41 Interferons are produced in virally infected cells and cause them
to secrete signals for surrounding cells to make antiviral proteins. C-reactive protein is induced to be made by the liver and will
opsonize certain species of bacteria. 42 The antigen is digested by the proteasome, brought into the endoplasmic reticulum by the
TAP transporter system, where it binds to class I
