A submuscular bursa is found between a muscle and an underlying
bone, or between adjacent muscles. These prevent rubbing of the muscle during movements. A large submuscular bursa,
the trochanteric bursa, is found at the lateral hip, between the greater trochanter of the femur and the overlying gluteus
maximus muscle. A subtendinous bursa is found between a tendon and a bone. Examples include the subacromial bursa
that protects the tendon of shoulder muscle as it passes under the acromion of the scapula, and the suprapatellar bursa that
separates the tendon of the large anterior thigh muscle from the distal femur just above the knee.

underlying bone.
