As weâ€™|l see shortly, in addition to its length, the folds and projections of the lining of the small

intestine work to give it an enormous surface area, which is approximately 200 m, more than 100 times the surface area of
your skin. This large surface area is necessary for complex processes of digestion and absorption that occur within it.

 Structure

The coiled tube of the small intestine is subdivided into three regions. From proximal (at the stomach) to distal, these are
the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum (Figure 23.18).

 The shortest region is the 25.4-cm (10-in) duodenum, which begins at the pyloric sphincter. Just past the pyloric
sphincter, it bends posteriorly behind the peritoneum, becoming retroperitoneal, and then makes a C-shaped curve around
the head of the pancreas before ascending anteriorly again to return to the peritoneal cavity and join the jejunum.
