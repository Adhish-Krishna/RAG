A hyperbaric chamber is a reinforced,
closed chamber that is pressurized to greater than atmospheric pressure. It treats DCS by repressurizing the body so
that pressure can then be removed much more gradually. Because the hyperbaric chamber introduces oxygen to the
body at high pressure, it increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood. This has the effect of replacing some of
the nitrogen in the blood with oxygen, which is easier to tolerate out of solution.

 The dynamic pressure of body fluids is also important to human survival. For example, blood pressure, which is the
pressure exerted by blood as it flows within blood vessels, must be great enough to enable blood to reach all body tissues,
and yet low enough to ensure that the delicate blood vessels can withstand the friction and force of the pulsating flow of
pressurized blood.
