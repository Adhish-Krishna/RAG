Moving the limb or hand laterally away from the body, or spreading the fingers or toes, is abduction.
 Adduction brings the limb or hand toward or across the midline of the body, or brings the fingers or toes together.
 Circumduction is the movement of the limb, hand, or fingers in a circular pattern, using the sequential combination
of flexion, adduction, extension, and abduction motions. Adduction/abduction and circumduction take place at the
shoulder, hip, wrist, metacarpophalangeal, and metatarsophalangeal joints. (f) Turning of the head side to side or
twisting of the body is rotation. Medial and lateral rotation of the upper limb at the shoulder or lower limb at the hip
involves turning the anterior surface of the limb toward the midline of the body (medial or internal rotation) or away
from the midline (lateral or external rotation).
