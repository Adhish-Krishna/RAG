Channel proteins are less selective than
carrier proteins, and usually mildly discriminate between their cargo based on size and charge. (b) Carrier proteins are
more selective, often only allowing one particular type of molecule to cross.

 In some cases, facilitated diffusion might move two substances in the same direction across the membrane, called a
“symport.” For example, in intestinal cells, sodium ions and glucose molecules are co-transported into the cells. In other
cases, the facilitated diffusion might only require a tunnel-like channel for particular solutes, such as electrolytes (small

charged ions), to pass through the membrane (this is called a “uniport”). As an example, even though sodium ions (Na*)
are highly concentrated outside of cells, these electrolytes are polarized and cannot pass through the nonpolar lipid bilayer
of the membrane.
