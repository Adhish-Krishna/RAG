Thermoregulation During strenuous physical activities, such as skiing (a) or running (c), the dermal
blood vessels dilate and sweat secretion increases (b). These mechanisms prevent the body from overheating. In
contrast, the dermal blood vessels constrict to minimize heat loss in response to low temperatures (b). (credit a:

 (a)

When body temperatures drop, the arterioles constrict to minimize heat loss, particularly in the ends of the digits and
tip of the nose. This reduced circulation can result in the skin taking on a whitish hue. Although the temperature of the skin
drops as a result, passive heat loss is prevented, and internal organs and structures remain warm. If the temperature of the
skin drops too much (such as environmental temperatures below freezing), the conservation of body core heat can result in
the skin actually freezing, a condition called frostbite.

Integumentary System

All systems in the body accumulate subtle and some not-so-subtle changes as a person ages.
