The trajectory of the ball and its speed
will need to be considered. Maybe the count is three balls and one strike, and the batter wants to let this pitch go by in the
hope of getting a walk to first base. Or maybe the batter’s team is so far ahead, it would be fun to just swing away.

 Controlling the Body

The nervous system can be divided into two parts mostly on the basis of a functional difference in responses. The somatic
nervous system (SNS) is responsible for conscious perception and voluntary motor responses. Voluntary motor response
means the contraction of skeletal muscle, but those contractions are not always voluntary in the sense that you have to want
to perform them. Some somatic motor responses are reflexes, and often happen without a conscious decision to perform
them. If your friend jumps out from behind a corner and yells “Boo!” you will be startled and you might scream or leap
back.
