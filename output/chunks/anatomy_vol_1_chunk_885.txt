This fusion
between bones is called a synostosis (“joined by bone”). Examples of synostosis fusions between cranial bones are found
both early and late in life. At the time of birth, the frontal and maxillary bones consist of right and left halves joined together
by sutures, which disappear by the eighth year as the halves fuse together to form a single bone. Late in life, the sagittal,
coronal, and lambdoid sutures of the skull will begin to ossify and fuse, causing the suture line to gradually disappear.

form fibrous joints between the bones of the skull.
