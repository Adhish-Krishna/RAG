The final cytoskeletal filament is the intermediate filament. As its name would suggest, an intermediate filament is a
filament intermediate in thickness between the microtubules and microfilaments (see Figure 3.18c). Intermediate filaments
are made up of long fibrous subunits of a protein called keratin that are wound together like the threads that compose a rope.
 Intermediate filaments, in concert with the microtubules, are important for maintaining cell shape and structure. Unlike the
microtubules, which resist compression, intermediate filaments resist tension—the forces that pull apart cells. There are
many cases in which cells are prone to tension, such as when epithelial cells of the skin are compressed, tugging them in
different directions. Intermediate filaments help anchor organelles together within a cell and also link cells to other cells by
forming special cell-to-cell junctions.
