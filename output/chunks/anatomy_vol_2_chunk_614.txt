When the two eyes move to look at something closer to the face, they both adduct, which is referred to as
convergence. To keep the stimulus in focus, the eye also needs to change the shape of the lens, which is controlled through
the parasympathetic fibers of the oculomotor nerve. The change in focal power of the eye is referred to as accommodation.
 Accommodation ability changes with age; focusing on nearer objects, such as the written text of a book or on a computer
screen, may require corrective lenses later in life. Coordination of the skeletal muscles for convergence and coordination of
the smooth muscles of the ciliary body for accommodation are referred to as the accommodationâ€”convergence reflex.

 A crucial function of the cranial nerves is to keep visual stimuli centered on the fovea of the retina. The vestibulo-
ocular reflex (VOR) coordinates all of the components (Figure 16.10), both sensory and motor, that make this possible.
