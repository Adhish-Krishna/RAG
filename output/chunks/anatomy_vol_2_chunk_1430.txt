CD4 is the receptor that HIV uses to get inside T

cells and reproduce. Given that CD4* helper T cells play an important role in other in T cell immune responses and antibody
responses, it should be no surprise that both types of immune responses are eventually seriously compromised.

 Treatment for the disease consists of drugs that target virally encoded proteins that are necessary for viral replication
but are absent from normal human cells. By targeting the virus itself and sparing the cells, this approach has been successful
in significantly prolonging the lives of HIV-positive individuals. On the other hand, an HIV vaccine has been 30 years in
development and is still years away. Because the virus mutates rapidly to evade the immune system, scientists have been
looking for parts of the virus that do not change and thus would be good targets for a vaccine candidate.
