Competing Neurotransmitters

The postganglionic fibers of the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions both release neurotransmitters that bind to
receptors on their targets. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers release norepinephrine, with a minor exception, whereas
postganglionic parasympathetic fibers release ACh. For any given target, the difference in which division of the autonomic
nervous system is exerting control is just in what chemical binds to its receptors. The target cells will have adrenergic and
muscarinic receptors. If norepinephrine is released, it will bind to the adrenergic receptors present on the target cell, and if
ACh is released, it will bind to the muscarinic receptors on the target cell.

 In the sympathetic system, there are exceptions to this pattern of dual innervation. The postganglionic sympathetic
â€˜ibers that contact the blood vessels within skeletal muscle and that contact sweat glands do not release norepinephrine, they
release ACh. This does not create any problem because there is no parasympathetic input to the sweat glands. Sweat glands
have muscarinic receptors and produce and secrete sweat in response to the presence of ACh.
