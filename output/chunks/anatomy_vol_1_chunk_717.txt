Posterior to the spinal cord is the ligamentum flavum (“yellow ligament”). This consists of a series
of short, paired ligaments, each of which interconnects the lamina regions of adjacent vertebrae. The ligamentum flavum

has large numbers of elastic fibers, which have a yellowish color, allowing it to stretch and then pull back. Both of these
ligaments provide important support for the vertebral column when bending forward.

Figure 7.31 Ligaments of Vertebral Column The anterior longitudinal ligament runs the length of the vertebral
column, uniting the anterior sides of the vertebral bodies. The supraspinous ligament connects the spinous processes
of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. In the posterior neck, the supraspinous ligament enlarges to form the nuchal
ligament, which attaches to the cervical spinous processes and to the base of the skull.
