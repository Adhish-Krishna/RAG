Figure 20.43 Hepatic Portal System The liver receives blood from the normal systemic circulation via the hepatic
artery. It also receives and processes blood from other organs, delivered via the veins of the hepatic portal system. All
blood exits the liver via the hepatic vein, which delivers the blood to the inferior vena cava. (Different colors are used
to help distinguish among the different vessels in the system.)

 20.6 | Development of Blood Vessels and Fetal Circulation

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Describe the development of blood vessels

Â¢ Describe the fetal circulation

In a developing embryo,the heart has developed enough by day 21 post-fertilization to begin beating. Circulation patterns
are clearly established by the fourth week of embryonic life. It is critical to the survival of the developing human that
the circulatory system forms early to supply the growing tissue with nutrients and gases, and to remove waste products.
