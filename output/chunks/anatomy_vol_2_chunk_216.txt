The cerebellum is situated on the posterior surface of the brain stem. Descending
input from the cerebellum enters through the large white matter structure of the pons. Ascending input from the
periphery and spinal cord enters through the fibers of the inferior olive. Output goes to the midbrain, which sends a
descending signal to the spinal cord.

 Descending fibers from the cerebrum have branches that connect to neurons in the pons. Those neurons project into the
cerebellum, providing a copy of motor commands sent to the spinal cord. Sensory information from the periphery, which
enters through spinal or cranial nerves, is copied to a nucleus in the medulla known as the inferior olive. Fibers from this
nucleus enter the cerebellum and are compared with the descending commands from the cerebrum. If the primary motor
cortex of the frontal lobe sends a command down to the spinal cord to initiate walking, a copy of that instruction is sent to
the cerebellum.
