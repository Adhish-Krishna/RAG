The causes of these disorders are also varied.
 Some are the result of genetics, such as Huntington’s disease, or the result of autoimmunity, such as MS; others are not
entirely understood, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Current research suggests that many of these diseases
are related in how the degeneration takes place and may be treated by common therapies.

 Finally, a common cause of neurological changes is observed in developmental disorders. Whether the result of
genetic factors or the environment during development, there are certain situations that result in neurological functions
being different from the expected norms. Developmental disorders are difficult to define because they are caused by
defects that existed in the past and disrupted the normal development of the CNS. These defects probably involve multiple
environmental and genetic factors—most of the time, we don’t know what the cause is other than that it is more complex
than just one factor.
