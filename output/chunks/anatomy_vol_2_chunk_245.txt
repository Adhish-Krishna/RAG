The arachnoid granulations are outpocketings of the
arachnoid membrane into the dural sinuses so that CSF can be reabsorbed into the blood, along with the metabolic wastes.
 From the dural sinuses, blood drains out of the head and neck through the jugular veins, along with the rest of the circulation
for blood, to be reoxygenated by the lungs and wastes to be filtered out by the kidneys (Table 13.2).

spinal cord, and how it originates from the ventricles and then spreads into the space within the meninges, where the

fluids then move into the venous sinuses to return to the cardiovascular circulation.
