Fixed to the surface of the microvilli membranes
are enzymes that finish digesting carbohydrates and proteins. There are an estimated 200 million microvilli per square
millimeter of small intestine, greatly expanding the surface area of the plasma membrane and thus greatly enhancing
absorption.

 Intestinal Glands

 In addition to the three specialized absorptive features just discussed, the mucosa between the villi is dotted with deep
crevices that each lead into a tubular intestinal gland (crypt of Lieberkiihn), which is formed by cells that line the crevices
(see Figure 23.19). These produce intestinal juice, a slightly alkaline (pH 7.4 to 7.8) mixture of water and mucus. Each

effects of chyme on the intestinal mucosa.
