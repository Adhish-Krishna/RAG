At high altitude, barometric pressure
is much less than on Earthâ€™s surface because pressure is produced by the weight of the column of air above the body
pressing down on the body. The very great pressures on divers in deep water are likewise from the weight of a column
of water pressing down on the body. For divers, DCS occurs at normal barometric pressure (at sea level), but it is
brought on by the relatively rapid decrease of pressure as divers rise from the high pressure conditions of deep water to
the now low, by comparison, pressure at sea level. Not surprisingly, diving in deep mountain lakes, where barometric
pressure at the surface of the lake is less than that at sea level is more likely to result in DCS than diving in water at
sea level.
