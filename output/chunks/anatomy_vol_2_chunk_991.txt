Prolapse may occur if the chordae tendineae are damaged or broken, causing the closure mechanism
to fail. The failure of the valve to close properly disrupts the normal one-way flow of blood and results in regurgitation,
when the blood flows backward from its normal path. Using a stethoscope, the disruption to the normal flow of blood
produces a heart murmur.

 Stenosis is a condition in which the heart valves become rigid and may calcify over time. The loss of flexibility
of the valve interferes with normal function and may cause the heart to work harder to propel blood through the valve,
which eventually weakens the heart. Aortic stenosis affects approximately 2 percent of the population over 65 years of
age, and the percentage increases to approximately 4 percent in individuals over 85 years. Occasionally, one or more
of the chordae tendineae will tear or the papillary muscle itself may die as a component of a myocardial infarction
(heart attack).
