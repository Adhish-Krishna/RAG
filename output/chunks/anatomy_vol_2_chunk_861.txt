Upon absorption, iron becomes part of
the bodyâ€™s total iron pool. The bone marrow, liver, and spleen can store iron in the protein compounds ferritin and
hemosiderin. Ferroportin transports the iron across the intestinal cell plasma membranes and from its storage sites
into tissue fluid where it enters the blood. When EPO stimulates the production of erythrocytes, iron is released from
storage, bound to transferrin, and carried to the red marrow where it attaches to erythrocyte precursors.

 * Copper. A trace mineral, copper is a component of two plasma proteins, hephaestin and ceruloplasmin. Without these,
hemoglobin could not be adequately produced. Located in intestinal villi, hephaestin enables iron to be absorbed by

intestinal cells. Ceruloplasmin transports copper. Both enable the oxidation of iron from Fe* to Fe**, a form in which

it can be bound to its transport protein, transferrin, for transport to body cells.
