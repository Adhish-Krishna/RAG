Read this article (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/strokespell) to learn about a teenager who experiences a series of
spells that suggest a stroke. He undergoes endless tests and seeks input from multiple doctors. In the end, one expert,
one question, and a simple blood pressure cuff answers the question. Why would the heart have to beat faster when the
teenager changes his body position from lying down to sitting, and then to standing?

Balance in Competing Autonomic Reflex Arcs

The autonomic nervous system is important for homeostasis because its two divisions compete at the target effector. The
balance of homeostasis is attributable to the competing inputs from the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions (dual
innervation). At the level of the target effector, the signal of which system is sending the message is strictly chemical. A
signaling molecule binds to a receptor that causes changes in the target cell, which in turn causes the tissue or organ to
respond to the changing conditions of the body.
