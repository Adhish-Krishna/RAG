It is thought
to play a role in appetite, as well as in the regulation of pancreatic exocrine and endocrine secretions. Pancreatic
polypeptide released following a meal may reduce further food consumption; however, it is also released in response
to fasting.

 Regulation of Blood Glucose Levels by Insulin and Glucagon

Glucose is required for cellular respiration and is the preferred fuel for all body cells. The body derives glucose from the
breakdown of the carbohydrate-containing foods and drinks we consume. Glucose not immediately taken up by cells for fuel
can be stored by the liver and muscles as glycogen, or converted to triglycerides and stored in the adipose tissue. Hormones
regulate both the storage and the utilization of glucose as required. Receptors located in the pancreas sense blood glucose
levels, and subsequently the pancreatic cells secrete glucagon or insulin to maintain normal levels.

 Glucagon

Receptors in the pancreas can sense the decline in blood glucose levels, such as during periods of fasting or during
prolonged labor or exercise (Figure 17.19).
