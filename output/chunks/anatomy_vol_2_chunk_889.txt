As noted earlier, thrombopoietin, a glycoprotein
secreted by the kidneys and liver, stimulates the proliferation of megakaryoblasts, which mature into megakaryocytes. These
remain within bone marrow tissue (Figure 18.12) and ultimately form platelet-precursor extensions that extend through the
walls of bone marrow capillaries to release into the circulation thousands of cytoplasmic fragments, each enclosed by a bit
of plasma membrane. These enclosed fragments are platelets. Each megakarocyte releases 2000-3000 platelets during its
lifespan. Following platelet release, megakaryocyte remnants, which are little more than a cell nucleus, are consumed by
macrophages.

Platelets are relatively small, 2-4 jm in diameter, but numerous, with typically 150,000-160,000 per pL of blood.
