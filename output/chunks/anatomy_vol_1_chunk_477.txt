In a growing fetus, fingerprints form where the cells of the stratum basale meet the papillae of the underlying
dermal layer (papillary layer), resulting in the formation of the ridges on your fingers that you recognize as fingerprints.
 Fingerprints are unique to each individual and are used for forensic analyses because the patterns do not change with the
growth and aging processes.

 Stratum Spinosum

As the name suggests, the stratum spinosum is spiny in appearance due to the protruding cell processes that join the cells
via a structure called a desmosome. The desmosomes interlock with each other and strengthen the bond between the cells. It
is interesting to note that the “spiny” nature of this layer is an artifact of the staining process. Unstained epidermis samples
do not exhibit this characteristic appearance. The stratum spinosum is composed of eight to 10 layers of keratinocytes,
formed as a result of cell division in the stratum basale (Figure 5.6).
