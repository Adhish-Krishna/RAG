Figure 7.2 Axial and Appendicular Skeleton The axial skeleton supports the head, neck, back, and chest and thus
forms the vertical axis of the body. It consists of the skull, vertebral column (including the sacrum and coccyx), and the
thoracic cage, formed by the ribs and sternum. The appendicular skeleton is made up of all bones of the upper and
lower limbs.

 The Appendicular Skeleton

The appendicular skeleton includes all bones of the upper and lower limbs, plus the bones that attach each limb to the axial
skeleton. There are 126 bones in the appendicular skeleton of an adult. The bones of the appendicular skeleton are covered
in a separate chapter.

 7.2 | The Skull

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

List and identify the bones of the brain case and face
Locate the major suture lines of the skull and name the bones associated with each

Locate and define the boundaries of the anterior, middle, and posterior cranial fossae, the temporal fossa, and
infratemporal fossa

Define the paranasal sinuses and identify the location of each

Name the bones that make up the walls of the orbit and identify the openings associated with the orbit
Identify the bones and structures that form the nasal septum and nasal conchae, and locate the hyoid bone
Identify the bony openings of the skull
