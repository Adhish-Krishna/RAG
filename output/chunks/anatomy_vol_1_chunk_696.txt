How may vertebral osteoporosis contribute to kyphosis?

General Structure of a Vertebra

Within the different regions of the vertebral column, vertebrae vary in size and shape, but they all follow a similar structural
pattern. A typical vertebra will consist of a body, a vertebral arch, and seven processes (Figure 7.23).

 The body is the anterior portion of each vertebra and is the part that supports the body weight. Because of this, the
vertebral bodies progressively increase in size and thickness going down the vertebral column. The bodies of adjacent
vertebrae are separated and strongly united by an intervertebral disc.

 The vertebral arch forms the posterior portion of each vertebra. It consists of four parts, the right and left pedicles and
the right and left laminae. Each pedicle forms one of the lateral sides of the vertebral arch. The pedicles are anchored to the
posterior side of the vertebral body. Each lamina forms part of the posterior roof of the vertebral arch.
