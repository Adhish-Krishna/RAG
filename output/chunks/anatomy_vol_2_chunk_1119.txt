There are also minute nerves within the walls of both types of vessels that
control the contraction and dilation of smooth muscle. These minute nerves are known as the nervi vasorum.

CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 841

Both arteries and veins have the same three distinct tissue layers, called tunics (from the Latin term tunica), for the
garments first worn by ancient Romans; the term tunic is also used for some modern garments. From the most interior
layer to the outer, these tunics are the tunica intima, the tunica media, and the tunica externa (see Figure 20.3). Table 20.1
compares and contrasts the tunics of the arteries and veins.

 Comparison of Tunics in Arteries and Veins

Arteries Veins
General Thick walls with small lumens Thin walls with large lumens
appearance Generally appear rounded Generally appear flattened
Endothelium usually appears wavy due to constriction of Endothelium appears smooth
Tunica intima smooth muscle Internal elastic membrane
Internal elastic membrane present in larger vessels absent

Normally thinner than the
tunica externa

Smooth muscle cells and
collagenous fibers
predominate

Nervi vasorum and vasa
vasorum present

External elastic membrane
absent

Normally the thickest layer in arteries

Smooth muscle cells and elastic fibers predominate (the
proportions of these vary with distance from the heart)
