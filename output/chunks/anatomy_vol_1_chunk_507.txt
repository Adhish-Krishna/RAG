For any form of armor, a breach in the protective barrier poses a danger. The skin can be breached when a child
skins a knee or an adult has blood drawn—one is accidental and the other medically necessary. However, you also
breach this barrier when you choose to “accessorize” your skin with a tattoo or body piercing. Because the needles
involved in producing body art and piercings must penetrate the skin, there are dangers associated with the practice.
 These include allergic reactions; skin infections; blood-borne diseases, such as tetanus, hepatitis C, and hepatitis D;
and the growth of scar tissue. Despite the risk, the practice of piercing the skin for decorative purposes has become
increasingly popular. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, 24 percent of people from ages 18 to 50

have a tattoo.
