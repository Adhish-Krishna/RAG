This increase in specificity comes because the adaptive immune
response has a unique way to develop as many as 10", or 100 trillion, different receptors to recognize nearly every
conceivable pathogen. How could so many different types of antibodies be encoded? And what about the many specificities
of T cells? There is not nearly enough DNA in a cell to have a separate gene for each specificity. The mechanism was finally
worked out in the 1970s and 1980s using the new tools of molecular genetics

Primary Disease and Immunological Memory

The immune systemâ€™s first exposure to a pathogen is called a primary adaptive response. Symptoms of a first infection,
called primary disease, are always relatively severe because it takes time for an initial adaptive immune response to a
pathogen to become effective.

 Upon re-exposure to the same pathogen, a secondary adaptive immune response is generated, which is stronger
and faster that the primary response.
