Eosinophils are attracted to

the site by T cell cytokines, which release their granule contents upon their arrival. Mast cell degranulation also occurs, and
the fluid leakage caused by the increase in local vascular permeability is thought to have a flushing action on the parasite,
expelling its larvae from the body. Furthermore, if IgE labels the parasite, the eosinophils can bind to it by its Fc receptor.

Defenses against Viruses

The primary mechanisms against viruses are NK cells, interferons, and cytotoxic T cells. Antibodies are effective against
viruses mostly during protection, where an immune individual can neutralize them based on a previous exposure.
 Antibodies have no effect on viruses or other intracellular pathogens once they enter the cell, since antibodies are not able
to penetrate the plasma membrane of the cell. Many cells respond to viral infections by downregulating their expression of
MHC class I molecules. This is to the advantage of the virus, because without class I expression, cytotoxic T cells have no
activity.
