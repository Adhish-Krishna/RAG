Each metarteriole arises from a terminal arteriole and branches
to supply blood to a capillary bed that may consist of 10-100 capillaries.

 The precapillary sphincters, circular smooth muscle cells that surround the capillary at its origin with the
metarteriole, tightly regulate the flow of blood from a metarteriole to the capillaries it supplies. Their function is critical:
If all of the capillary beds in the body were to open simultaneously, they would collectively hold every drop of blood in
the body and there would be none in the arteries, arterioles, venules, veins, or the heart itself. Normally, the precapillary
sphincters are closed. When the surrounding tissues need oxygen and have excess waste products, the precapillary
sphincters open, allowing blood to flow through and exchange to occur before closing once more (Figure 20.6). If all of
the precapillary sphincters in a capillary bed are closed, blood will flow from the metarteriole directly into a thoroughfare
channel and then into the venous circulation, bypassing the capillary bed entirely.
