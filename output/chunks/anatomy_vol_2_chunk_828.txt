Figure 18.2 Composition of Blood The cellular elements of blood include a vast number of erythrocytes and
comparatively fewer leukocytes and platelets. Plasma is the fluid in which the formed elements are suspended. A
sample of blood spun in a centrifuge reveals that plasma is the lightest component. It floats at the top of the tube
separated from the heaviest elements, the erythrocytes, by a buffy coat of leukocytes and platelets. Hematocrit is the
percentage of the total sample that is comprised of erythrocytes. Depressed and elevated hematocrit levels are shown
for comparison.

 Characteristics of Blood

When you think about blood, the first characteristic that probably comes to mind is its color. Blood that has just taken up
oxygen in the lungs is bright red, and blood that has released oxygen in the tissues is a more dusky red.
