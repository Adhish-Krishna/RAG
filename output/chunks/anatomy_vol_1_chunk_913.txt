The replacement head for the
femur consists of a rounded ball attached to the end of a shaft that is inserted inside the diaphysis of the femur. The
acetabulum of the pelvis is reshaped and a replacement socket is fitted into its place. The parts, which are always built
in advance of the surgery, are sometimes custom made to produce the best possible fit for a patient.

 Gout is a form of arthritis that results from the deposition of uric acid crystals within a body joint. Usually only
one or a few joints are affected, such as the big toe, knee, or ankle. The attack may only last a few days, but may
return to the same or another joint. Gout occurs when the body makes too much uric acid or the kidneys do not
properly excrete it. A diet with excessive fructose has been implicated in raising the chances of a susceptible individual
developing gout.

 Other forms of arthritis are associated with various autoimmune diseases, bacterial infections of the joint,
or unknown genetic causes.
