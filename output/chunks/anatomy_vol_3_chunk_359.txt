Pyruvate into acetyl CoA = 0 ATP
Krebs cycle = 2 ATP
+ ETC = 34 ATP.

Figure 24.9 Carbohydrate Metabolism Carbohydrate metabolism involves glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the
electron transport chain.

 Gluconeogenesis

Gluconeogenesis is the synthesis of new glucose molecules from pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, or the amino acids alanine
or glutamine. This process takes place primarily in the liver during periods of low glucose, that is, under conditions of
fasting, starvation, and low carbohydrate diets. So, the question can be raised as to why the body would create something
it has just spent a fair amount of effort to break down? Certain key organs, including the brain, can use only glucose as
