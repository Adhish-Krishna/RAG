Epithelial cells have a very brief lifespan, averaging from only a couple of days (in the mouth) to about a
week (in the gut). This process of rapid renewal helps preserve the health of the alimentary canal, despite the wear and tear
resulting from continued contact with foodstuffs.

 Lamina propria—In addition to loose connective tissue, the lamina propria contains numerous blood and lymphatic
vessels that transport nutrients absorbed through the alimentary canal to other parts of the body. The lamina propria also
serves an immune function by housing clusters of lymphocytes, making up the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT).
 These lymphocyte clusters are particularly substantial in the distal ileum where they are known as Peyer’s patches. When
you consider that the alimentary canal is exposed to foodborne bacteria and other foreign matter, it is not hard to appreciate
why the immune system has evolved a means of defending against the pathogens encountered within it.
