Gas Exchange

In order to understand the mechanisms of gas exchange in the lung, it is important to understand the underlying principles
of gases and their behavior. In addition to Boyleâ€™s law, several other gas laws help to describe the behavior of gases.

 Gas Laws and Air Composition

Gas molecules exert force on the surfaces with which they are in contact; this force is called pressure. In natural systems,

gases are normally present as a mixture of dif

erent types of molecules. For example, the atmosphere consists of oxygen,

nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and other gaseous molecules, and this gaseous mixture exerts a certain pressure referred to as
atmospheric pressure (Table 22.2). Partial pressure (Px) is the pressure of a single type of gas in a mixture of gases. For
example, in the atmosphere, oxygen exerts a partial pressure, and nitrogen exerts another partial pressure, independent of
