In the small intestine, dietary triglycerides combine with other lipids and proteins, and enter
the lacteals to form a milky fluid called chyle. The chyle then travels through the lymphatic system, eventually entering the
liver and then the bloodstream.

 Larger Lymphatic Vessels, Trunks, and Ducts

The lymphatic capillaries empty into larger lymphatic vessels, which are similar to veins in terms of their three-tunic
structure and the presence of valves. These one-way valves are located fairly close to one another, and each one causes a
bulge in the lymphatic vessel, giving the vessels a beaded appearance (see Figure 21.3).

 The superficial and deep lymphatics eventually merge to form larger lymphatic vessels known as lymphatic trunks.
 On the right side of the body, the right sides of the head, thorax, and right upper limb drain lymph fluid into the right
subclavian vein via the right lymphatic duct (Figure 21.4).
