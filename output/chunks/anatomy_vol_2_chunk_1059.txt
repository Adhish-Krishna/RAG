Heart Rate (HR) Stroke Volume (SV) = EDV - ESV
| Cardiac Output(CO) = HR xX sv

Figure 19.31 Major Factors Influencing Cardiac Output Cardiac output is influenced by heart rate and stroke
volume, both of which are also variable.

 SVs are also used to calculate ejection fraction, which is the portion of the blood that is pumped or ejected from the
heart with each contraction. To calculate ejection fraction, SV is divided by EDV. Despite the name, the ejection fraction is
normally expressed as a percentage. Ejection fractions range from approximately 55-70 percent, with a mean of 58 percent.

 Exercise and Maximum Cardiac Output

In healthy young individuals, HR may increase to 150 bpm during exercise.
