40 The talus bone articulates superiorly with
the tibia and fibula at the ankle joint, with body weight passed from the tibia to the talus. Body weight from the talus is transmitted
to the ground by both ends of the medial and lateral longitudinal foot arches. Weight is passed posteriorly through both arches to
the calcaneus bone, which forms the heel of the foot and is in contact with the ground. On the medial side of the foot, body weight
is passed anteriorly from the talus bone to the navicular bone, and then to the medial, intermediate, and lateral cuneiform bones.
 The cuneiform bones pass the weight anteriorly to the first, second, and third metatarsal bones, whose heads (distal ends) are in
contact with the ground. On the lateral side, body weight is passed anteriorly from the talus through the calcaneus, cuboid, and
ourth and fifth metatarsal bones.
