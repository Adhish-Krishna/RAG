Figure 24.6 Aerobic versus Anaerobic Respiration The process of anaerobic respiration converts glucose into two

lactate molecules in the absence of oxygen or within erythrocytes that lack mitochondria. During aerobic respiration,
glucose is oxidized into two pyruvate molecules.

 Krebs Cycle/Citric Acid Cycle/Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle

The pyruvate molecules generated during glycolysis are transported across the mitochondrial membrane into the inner
mitochondrial matrix, where they are metabolized by enzymes in a pathway called the Krebs cycle (Figure 24.7).
