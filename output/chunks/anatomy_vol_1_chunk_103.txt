Although the
first PET scanner was introduced in 1961, it took 15 more years before radiopharmaceuticals were combined with the
technique and revolutionized its potential. The main advantage is that PET (see Figure 1.19c) can illustrate physiologic
activity—including nutrient metabolism and blood flow—of the organ or organs being targeted, whereas CT and MRI scans
can only show static images. PET is widely used to diagnose a multitude of conditions, such as heart disease, the spread of
cancer, certain forms of infection, brain abnormalities, bone disease, and thyroid disease.

 PET relies on radioactive substances administered several minutes before the scan. Watch this video

Ultrasonography

Ultrasonography is an imaging technique that uses the transmission of high-frequency sound waves into the body to
generate an echo signal that is converted by a computer into a real-time image of anatomy and physiology (see Figure
1.19d).
