These bones are attached to each other by an interosseous membrane.

 More distal is the shaft of the ulna. The lateral side of the shaft forms a ridge called the interosseous border of the
ulna. This is the line of attachment for the interosseous membrane of the forearm, a sheet of dense connective tissue that
unites the ulna and radius bones. The small, rounded area that forms the distal end is the head of the ulna. Projecting from
the posterior side of the ulnar head is the styloid process of the ulna, a short bony projection. This serves as an attachment
point for a connective tissue structure that unites the distal ends of the ulna and radius.

 In the anatomical position, with the elbow fully extended and the palms facing forward, the arm and forearm do not
form a straight line. Instead, the forearm deviates laterally by 5â€”15 degrees from the line of the arm. This deviation is called
the carrying angle. It allows the forearm and hand to swing freely or to carry an object without hitting the hip.
