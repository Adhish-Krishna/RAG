The top and sides of the tongue are studded with papillae, extensions of lamina propria of the mucosa, which are
covered in stratified squamous epithelium (Figure 23.8). Fungiform papillae, which are mushroom shaped, cover a large

papillae are long and thin. Fungiform papillae contain taste buds, and filiform papillae have touch receptors that help the
tongue move food around in the mouth. The filiform papillae create an abrasive surface that performs mechanically, much
like a catâ€™s rough tongue that is used for grooming. Lingual glands in the lamina propria of the tongue secrete mucus and
a watery serous fluid that contains the enzyme lingual lipase, which plays a minor role in breaking down triglycerides but
does not begin working until it is activated in the stomach.
