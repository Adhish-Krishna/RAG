The talus bone, which
receives the weight of the body, is located at the top of the longitudinal arches. Body weight is then conveyed from the talus
to the ground by the anterior and posterior ends of these arches. Strong ligaments unite the adjacent foot bones to prevent
disruption of the arches during weight bearing. On the bottom of the foot, additional ligaments tie together the anterior and
posterior ends of the arches. These ligaments have elasticity, which allows them to stretch somewhat during weight bearing,
thus allowing the longitudinal arches to spread. The stretching of these ligaments stores energy within the foot, rather than
passing these forces into the leg. Contraction of the foot muscles also plays an important role in this energy absorption.
 When the weight is removed, the elastic ligaments recoil and pull the ends of the arches closer together. This recovery of
the arches releases the stored energy and improves the energy efficiency of walking.
