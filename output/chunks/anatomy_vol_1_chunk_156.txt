These charges are often referred to as “partial
charges” because the strength of the charge is less than one full electron, as would occur in an ionic bond. As shown in
Figure 2.10, regions of weak polarity are indicated with the Greek letter delta (0) and a plus (+) or minus (-) sign.

 Even though a single water molecule is unimaginably tiny, it has mass, and the opposing electrical charges on the
molecule pull that mass in such a way that it creates a shape somewhat like a triangular tent (see Figure 2.10b). This dipole,
with the positive charges at one end formed by the hydrogen atoms at the “bottom” of the tent and the negative charge
at the opposite end (the oxygen atom at the “top” of the tent) makes the charged regions highly likely to interact with
charged regions of other polar molecules.
