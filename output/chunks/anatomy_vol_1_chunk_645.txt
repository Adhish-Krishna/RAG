The temporal bone is subdivided into several regions (Figure 7.7). The flattened, upper portion is the squamous portion
of the temporal bone. Below this area and projecting anteriorly is the zygomatic process of the temporal bone, which forms
the posterior portion of the zygomatic arch. Posteriorly is the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. Projecting inferiorly
rom this region is a large prominence, the mastoid process, which serves as a muscle attachment site. The mastoid process
can easily be felt on the side of the head just behind your earlobe. On the interior of the skull, the petrous portion of each
temporal bone forms the prominent, diagonally oriented petrous ridge in the floor of the cranial cavity. Located inside each
petrous ridge are small cavities that house the structures of the middle and inner ears.
