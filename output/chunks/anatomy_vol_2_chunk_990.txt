Valvular disorders are often caused by carditis, or inflammation of the heart. One common trigger for this
inflammation is rheumatic fever, or scarlet fever, an autoimmune response to the presence of a bacterium,
Streptococcus pyogenes, normally a disease of childhood.

 While any of the heart valves may be involved in valve disorders, mitral regurgitation is the most common,
detected in approximately 2 percent of the population, and the pulmonary semilunar valve is the least frequently
involved. When a valve malfunctions, the flow of blood to a region will often be disrupted. The resulting inadequate
flow of blood to this region will be described in general terms as an insufficiency. The specific type of insufficiency
is named for the valve involved: aortic insufficiency, mitral insufficiency, tricuspid insufficiency, or pulmonary
insufficiency.

 If one of the cusps of the valve is forced backward by the force of the blood, the condition is referred to as a
prolapsed valve.
