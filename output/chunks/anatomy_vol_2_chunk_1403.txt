IgM is usually the first antibody made during a primary response. Its 10 antigen-binding sites and
large shape allow it to bind well to many bacterial surfaces. It is excellent at binding complement proteins and activating
the complement cascade, consistent with its role in promoting chemotaxis, opsonization, and cell lysis. Thus, it is a very
effective antibody against bacteria at early stages of a primary antibody response. As the primary response proceeds, the
antibody produced in a B cell can change to IgG, IgA, or IgE by the process known as class switching. Class switching
is the change of one antibody class to another. While the class of antibody changes, the specificity and the antigen-binding
sites do not. Thus, the antibodies made are still specific to the pathogen that stimulated the initial IgM response.

 IgG is a major antibody of late primary responses and the main antibody of secondary responses in the blood.
