Because the lipid tails are hydrophobic, they meet in the inner region of the membrane, excluding watery
intracellular and extracellular fluid from this space. The cell membrane has many proteins, as well as other lipids (such as
cholesterol), that are associated with the phospholipid bilayer. An important feature of the membrane is that it remains fluid;
the lipids and proteins in the cell membrane are not rigidly locked in place.

Figure 3.3 Phospolipid Bilayer The phospholipid bilayer consists of two adjacent sheets of phospholipids, arranged
tail to tail, The hydrophobic tails associate with one another, forming the interior of the membrane. The polar heads
contact the fluid inside and outside of the cell.

 Membrane Proteins

The lipid bilayer forms the basis of the cell membrane, but it is peppered throughout with various proteins. Two different
types of proteins that are commonly associated with the cell membrane are the integral proteins and peripheral protein
(Figure 3.4).
