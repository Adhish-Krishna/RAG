In
real life, however, the influence of chance could change that ratio significantly. For example, if a man and a woman are both
heterozygous for cystic fibrosis, a recessive genetic disorder that is expressed only when the individual has two defective
alleles, we would expect one in four of their children to have cystic fibrosis. However, it is entirely possible for them to have
seven children, none of whom is affected, or for them to have two children, both of whom are affected. For each individual
child, the presence or absence of a single gene disorder depends on which alleles that child inherits from his or her parents.

 Autosomal Dominant Inheritance

In the case of cystic fibrosis, the disorder is recessive to the normal phenotype. However, a genetic abnormality may
be dominant to the normal phenotype. When the dominant allele is located on one of the 22 pairs of autosomes (non-
sex chromosomes), we refer to its inheritance pattern as autosomal dominant.
