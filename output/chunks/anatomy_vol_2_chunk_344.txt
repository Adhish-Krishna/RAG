Figure 14.13 The Eye in the Orbit The eye is located within the orbit and surrounded by soft tissues that protect and
support its function. The orbit is surrounded by cranial bones of the skull.

 Movement of the eye within the orbit is accomplished by the contraction of six extraocular muscles that originate
from the bones of the orbit and insert into the surface of the eyeball (Figure 14.14). Four of the muscles are arranged at
the cardinal points around the eye and are named for those locations. They are the superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior
rectus, and lateral rectus. When each of these muscles contract, the eye to moves toward the contracting muscle. For
example, when the superior rectus contracts, the eye rotates to look up. The superior oblique originates at the posterior
orbit, near the origin of the four rectus muscles.
