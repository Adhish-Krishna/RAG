Muscularis mucosaâ€”This thin layer of smooth muscle is in a constant state of tension, pulling the mucosa of the
stomach and small intestine into undulating folds. These folds dramatically increase the surface area available for digestion
and absorption.

 As its name implies, the submucosa lies immediately beneath the mucosa. A broad layer of dense connective tissue,
it connects the overlying mucosa to the underlying muscularis. It includes blood and lymphatic vessels (which transport
absorbed nutrients), and a scattering of submucosal glands that release digestive secretions. Additionally, it serves as a
conduit for a dense branching network of nerves, the submucosal plexus, which functions as described below.
 The third layer of the alimentary canal is the muscalaris (also called the muscularis externa). The muscularis in the
small intestine is made up of a double layer of smooth muscle: an inner circular layer and an outer longitudinal layer.
