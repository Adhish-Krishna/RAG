Because heat helps increase the kinetic energy of atoms, ions, and molecules, it promotes their collision. But in
the body, extremely high heat—such as a very high fever—can damage body cells and be life-threatening. On the other
hand, normal body temperature is not high enough to promote the chemical reactions that sustain life. That is where catalysts
come in.

 In chemistry, a catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself undergoing any
change. You can think of a catalyst as a chemical change agent. They help increase the rate and force at which atoms, ions,
and molecules collide, thereby increasing the probability that their valence shell electrons will interact.

 The most important catalysts in the human body are enzymes. An enzyme is a catalyst composed of protein or
ribonucleic acid (RNA), both of which will be discussed later in this chapter.
