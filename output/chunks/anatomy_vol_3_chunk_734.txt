Often, the body is able to clear an HPV infection by normal
immune responses within 2 years. However, the more serious, high-risk infection by certain types of HPV can result
in cancer of the cervix (Figure 27.16). Infection with either of the cancer-causing variants HPV 16 or HPV 18 has
been linked to more than 70 percent of all cervical cancer diagnoses. Although even these high-risk HPV strains can
be cleared from the body over time, infections persist in some individuals. If this happens, the HPV infection can
influence the cells of the cervix to develop precancerous changes.

 Risk factors for cervical cancer include having unprotected sex; having multiple sexual partners; a first sexual
experience at a younger age, when the cells of the cervix are not fully mature; failure to receive the HPV vaccine; a
compromised immune system; and smoking.
