Similarly, baroreceptors are stretch receptors located in the aortic sinus, carotid bodies, the venae cavae, and other
locations, including pulmonary vessels and the right side of the heart itself. Rates of firing from the baroreceptors
represent blood pressure, level of physical activity, and the relative distribution of blood. The cardiac centers monitor
baroreceptor firing to maintain cardiac homeostasis, a mechanism called the baroreceptor reflex. With increased pressure
and stretch, the rate of baroreceptor firing increases, and the cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation and increase
parasympathetic stimulation. As pressure and stretch decrease, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases, and the cardiac
centers increase sympathetic stimulation and decrease parasympathetic stimulation.

 There is a similar reflex, called the atrial reflex or Bainbridge reflex, associated with varying rates of blood flow to
the atria. Increased venous return stretches the walls of the atria where specialized baroreceptors are located. However, as
the atrial baroreceptors increase their rate of firing and as they stretch due to the increased blood pressure, the cardiac center
responds by increasing sympathetic stimulation and inhibiting parasympathetic stimulation to increase HR.
