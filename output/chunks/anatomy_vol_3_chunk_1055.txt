tract infection. 32 Diabetes mellitus would result in urine containing glucose, and diabetes insipidus would produce urine with
very low osmolarity (low specific gravity, dilute). 33 The longer urethra of males means bacteria must travel farther to the bladder
to cause an infection. 34 Forceful urination is accomplished by contraction of abdominal muscles. 35 Retroperitoneal anchoring,
renal fat pads, and ribs provide protection to the kidney. 36 The renal portal system has an artery between the first and second
capillary bed. The others have a vein. 37 The structures found in the renal hilum are arteries, veins, ureters, lymphatics, and
nerves. 38 The structures that make up the renal corpuscle are the glomerulus, Bowmanâ€™s capsule, and PCT.
