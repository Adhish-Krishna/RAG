As mentioned above, a greater
partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli causes the pulmonary arterioles to dilate, increasing blood flow.

 Gas Exchange

Gas exchange occurs at two sites in the body: in the lungs, where oxygen is picked up and carbon dioxide is released at the
respiratory membrane, and at the tissues, where oxygen is released and carbon dioxide is picked up. External respiration
is the exchange of gases with the external environment, and occurs in the alveoli of the lungs. Internal respiration is the
exchange of gases with the internal environment, and occurs in the tissues. The actual exchange of gases occurs due to
simple diffusion. Energy is not required to move oxygen or carbon dioxide across membranes. Instead, these gases follow
pressure gradients that allow them to diffuse. The anatomy of the lung maximizes the diffusion of gases: The respiratory
membrane is highly permeable to gases; the respiratory and blood capillary membranes are very thin; and there is a large
surface area throughout the lungs.
