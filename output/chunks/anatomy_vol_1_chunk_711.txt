The discs also provide padding
between vertebrae during weight bearing. Because of this, intervertebral discs are thin in the cervical region and thickest
in the lumbar region, which carries the most body weight. In total, the intervertebral discs account for approximately 25
percent of your body height between the top of the pelvis and the base of the skull. Intervertebral discs are also flexible and
can change shape to allow for movements of the vertebral column.

 Each intervertebral disc consists of two parts. The anulus fibrosus is the tough, fibrous outer layer of the disc. It forms
a circle (anulus = “ring” or “circle”) and is firmly anchored to the outer margins of the adjacent vertebral bodies. Inside is the
nucleus pulposus, consisting of a softer, more gel-like material. It has a high water content that serves to resist compression
and thus is important for weight bearing. With increasing age, the water content of the nucleus pulposus gradually declines.
