Once regarded as a simple lining layer, recent evidence indicates that the endothelium of the endocardium and
the coronary capillaries may play active roles in regulating the contraction of the muscle within the myocardium. The
endothelium may also regulate the growth patterns of the cardiac muscle cells throughout life, and the endothelins it
secretes create an environment in the surrounding tissue fluids that regulates ionic concentrations and states of contractility.

 786 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART

Endothelins are potent vasoconstrictors and, in a normal individual, establish a homeostatic balance with other
vasoconstrictors and vasodilators.

 Internal Structure of the Heart

Recall that the heart’s contraction cycle follows a dual pattern of circulation—the pulmonary and systemic
circuits—because of the pairs of chambers that pump blood into the circulation. In order to develop a more precise
understanding of cardiac function, it is first necessary to explore the internal anatomical structures in more detail.
