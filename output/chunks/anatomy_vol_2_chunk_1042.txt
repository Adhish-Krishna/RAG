The nomenclature for these is very
straightforward. SA nodal blocks occur within the SA node. AV nodal blocks occur within the AV node. Infra-Hisian blocks
involve the bundle of His. Bundle branch blocks occur within either the left or right atrioventricular bundle branches.
 Hemiblocks are partial and occur within one or more fascicles of the atrioventricular bundle branch. Clinically, the most
common types are the AV nodal and infra-Hisian blocks.

 AV blocks are often described by degrees. A first-degree or partial block indicates a delay in conduction between the
SA and AV nodes. This can be recognized on the ECG as an abnormally long PR interval. A second-degree or incomplete
block occurs when some impulses from the SA node reach the AV node and continue, while others do not. In this instance,
the ECG would reveal some P waves not followed by a QRS complex, while others would appear normal.
