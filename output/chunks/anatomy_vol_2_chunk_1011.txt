The T tubules are only found at the Z discs, whereas in skeletal muscle, they are found at the junction of
the A and I bands. Therefore, there are one-half as many T tubules in cardiac muscle as in skeletal muscle. In addition, the
sarcoplasmic reticulum stores few calcium ions, so most of the calcium ions must come from outside the cells. The result
is a slower onset of contraction. Mitochondria are plentiful, providing energy for the contractions of the heart. Typically,
cardiomyocytes have a single, central nucleus, but two or more nuclei may be found in some cells.

 Cardiac muscle cells branch freely. A junction between two adjoining cells is marked by a critical structure called an
intercalated disc, which helps support the synchronized contraction of the muscle (Figure 19.17b). The sarcolemmas from
adjacent cells bind together at the intercalated discs. They consist of desmosomes, specialized linking proteoglycans, tight
junctions, and large numbers of gap junctions that allow the passage of ions between the cells and help to synchronize the
contraction (Figure 19.17c).
