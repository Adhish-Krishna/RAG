Further, the distribution of vessels is not the same in all tissues. Adipose tissue
does not have an extensive vascular supply. One pound of adipose tissue contains approximately 200 miles of vessels,
whereas skeletal muscle contains more than twice that. Overall, vessels decrease in length only during loss of mass or
amputation. An individual weighing 150 pounds has approximately 60,000 miles of vessels in the body. Gaining about 10
pounds adds from 2000 to 4000 miles of vessels, depending upon the nature of the gained tissue. One of the great benefits
of weight reduction is the reduced stress to the heart, which does not have to overcome the resistance of as many miles of
vessels.

 In contrast to length, the diameter of blood vessels changes throughout the body, according to the type of vessel, as we
discussed earlier. The diameter of any given vessel may also change frequently throughout the day in response to neural and
chemical signals that trigger vasodilation and vasoconstriction.
