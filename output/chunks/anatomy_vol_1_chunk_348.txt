In contrast, a second class of genes known as tumor suppressor genes sends stop signals during a cell
cycle. For example, certain protein products of tumor suppressor genes signal potential problems with the DNA and
thus stop the cell from dividing, while other proteins signal the cell to die if it is damaged beyond repair. Some tumor
suppressor proteins also signal a sufficient surrounding cellular density, which indicates that the cell need not presently
divide. The latter function is uniquely important in preventing tumor growth: normal cells exhibit a phenomenon
called “contact inhibition;” thus, extensive cellular contact with neighboring cells causes a signal that stops further cell
division.

 These two contrasting classes of genes, proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, are like the accelerator and
brake pedal of the cell’s own “cruise control system,” respectively. Under normal conditions, these stop and go signals
are maintained in a homeostatic balance. Generally speaking, there are two ways that the cell’s cruise control can
lose control: a malfunctioning (overactive) accelerator, or a malfunctioning (underactive) brake.
