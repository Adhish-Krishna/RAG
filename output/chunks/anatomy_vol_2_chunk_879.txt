Neutrophil Eosinophil Basophil

Figure 18.11 Granular Leukocytes A neutrophil has small granules that stain light lilac and a nucleus with two to
five lobes. An eosinophil’s granules are slightly larger and stain reddish-orange, and its nucleus has two to three lobes.
 A basophil has large granules that stain dark blue to purple and a two-lobed nucleus.

 The most common of all the leukocytes, neutrophils will normally comprise 50-70 percent of total leukocyte count.
 They are 10-12 jm in diameter, significantly larger than erythrocytes. They are called neutrophils because their granules
show up most clearly with stains that are chemically neutral (neither acidic nor basic). The granules are numerous but
quite fine and normally appear light lilac. The nucleus has a distinct lobed appearance and may have two to five lobes, the
number increasing with the age of the cell. Older neutrophils have increasing numbers of lobes and are often referred to as
polymorphonuclear (a nucleus with many forms), or simply “polys.”
