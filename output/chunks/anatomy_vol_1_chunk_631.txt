Thus, muscle attachment sites on bones will thicken if you begin a workout program that increases muscle
strength. Similarly, the walls of weight-bearing bones will thicken if you gain body weight or begin pounding the pavement
as part of a new running regimen. In contrast, a reduction in muscle strength or body weight will cause bones to become
thinner. This may happen during a prolonged hospital stay, following limb immobilization in a cast, or going into the
weightlessness of outer space. Even a change in diet, such as eating only soft food due to the loss of teeth, will result in a
noticeable decrease in the size and thickness of the jaw bones.

 7.1 | Divisions of the Skeletal System

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 ¢ Discuss the functions of the skeletal system
¢ Distinguish between the axial skeleton and appendicular skeleton
¢ Define the axial skeleton and its components

¢ Define the appendicular skeleton and its components

The skeletal system includes all of the bones, cartilages, and ligaments of the body that support and give shape to the body
and body structures.
