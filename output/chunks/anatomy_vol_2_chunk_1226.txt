Figure 20.23 Pulmonary Circuit Blood exiting from the right ventricle flows into the pulmonary trunk, which bifurcates
into the two pulmonary arteries. These vessels branch to supply blood to the pulmonary capillaries, where gas
exchange occurs within the lung alveoli. Blood returns via the pulmonary veins to the left atrium.

 Pulmonary Arteries and Veins

Vessel Description

 Pulmonary | Single large vessel exiting the right ventricle that divides to form the right and left pulmonary
trunk arteries

Pulmonary | Left and right vessels that form from the pulmonary trunk and lead to smaller arterioles and
arteries eventually to the pulmonary capillaries

Pulmonary | Two sets of paired vessels—one pair on each side—that are formed from the small venules,
leading away from the pulmonary capillaries to flow into the left atrium

veins

Overview of Systemic Arteries

Blood relatively high in oxygen concentration is returned from the pulmonary circuit to the left atrium via the four
pulmonary veins.
