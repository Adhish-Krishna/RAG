In some cases, however, the virus continues to spread and becomes an invasive cancer.

 When the high-risk types of HPV enter a cell, two viral proteins are used to neutralize proteins that the host
cells use as checkpoints in the cell cycle. The best studied of these proteins is p53. In a normal cell, p53 detects
DNA damage in the cell’s genome and either halts the progression of the cell cycle—allowing time for DNA repair
to occur—or initiates apoptosis. Both of these processes prevent the accumulation of mutations in a cell’s genome.
High-risk HPV can neutralize p53, keeping the cell in a state in which fast growth is possible and impairing apoptosis,
allowing mutations to accumulate in the cellular DNA.

 The prevalence of cervical cancer in the United States is very low because of regular screening exams called
pap smears. Pap smears sample cells of the cervix, allowing the detection of abnormal cells.
