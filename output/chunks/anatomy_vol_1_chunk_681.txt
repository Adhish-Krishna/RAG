¢ Foramen spinosum—This small opening, located posterior-lateral to the foramen ovale, is the entry point for an
important artery that supplies the covering layers surrounding the brain. The branching pattern of this artery forms
readily visible grooves on the internal surface of the skull and these grooves can be traced back to their origin at the
foramen spinosum.
 ¢ Carotid canal—This is the zig-zag passageway through which a major artery to the brain enters the skull. The
entrance to the carotid canal is located on the inferior aspect of the skull, anteromedial to the styloid process (see
Figure 7.8a). From here, the canal runs anteromedially within the bony base of the skull. Just above the foramen
lacerum, the carotid canal opens into the middle cranial cavity, near the posterior-lateral base of the sella turcica.
 ¢ Foramen lacerum—This irregular opening is located in the base of the skull, immediately inferior to the exit of the
carotid canal.
