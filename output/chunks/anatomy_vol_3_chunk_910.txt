When Mendel crossed
heterozygous individuals, he repeatedly found a 3:1 dominant-recessive ratio. He correctly postulated that the expression
of the recessive trait was masked in heterozygotes but would resurface in their offspring in a predictable manner.

 Human genetics focuses on identifying different alleles and understanding how they express themselves. Medical
researchers are especially interested in the identification of inheritance patterns for genetic disorders, which provides the
means to estimate the risk that a given coupleâ€™s offspring will inherit a genetic disease or disorder. Patterns of inheritance
in humans include autosomal dominance and recessiveness, X-linked dominance and recessiveness, incomplete dominance,
codominance, and lethality. A change in the nucleotide sequence of DNA, which may or may not manifest in a phenotype,
is called a mutation.
