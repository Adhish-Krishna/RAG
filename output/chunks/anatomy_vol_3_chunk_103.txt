As a result, oxygen readily dissociates from hemoglobin, which is a mechanism that helps to
provide active tissues with more oxygen.
 Certain hormones, such as androgens, epinephrine, thyroid hormones, and growth hormone, can affect the
oxygen-hemoglobin  saturation/disassociation curve by stimulating the production of a compound called
2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG) by erythrocytes. BPG is a byproduct of glycolysis. Because erythrocytes do not contain
mitochondria, glycolysis is the sole method by which these cells produce ATP. BPG promotes the disassociation of oxygen
rom hemoglobin. Therefore, the greater the concentration of BPG, the more readily oxygen dissociates from hemoglobin,
despite its partial pressure.
 The pH of the blood is another factor that influences the oxygen-hemoglobin saturation/dissociation curve (see
Figure 22.26). The Bohr effect is a phenomenon that arises from the relationship between pH and oxygenâ€™s affinity for
hemoglobin: A lower, more acidic pH promotes oxygen dissociation from hemoglobin.
