In terms of scale, the diameter of an arteriole is measured in micrometers compared to millimeters
for elastic and muscular arteries.

 Farther from the heart, where the surge of blood has dampened, the percentage of elastic fibers in an artery’s tunica
intima decreases and the amount of smooth muscle in its tunica media increases. The artery at this point is described as

a muscular artery. The diameter of muscular arteries typically ranges from 0.1 mm to 10 mm. Their thick tunica media
allows muscular arteries to play a leading role in vasoconstriction. In contrast, their decreased quantity of elastic fibers
limits their ability to expand. Fortunately, because the blood pressure has eased by the time it reaches these more distant
vessels, elasticity has become less important.

 Notice that although the distinctions between elastic and muscular arteries are important, there is no “line of
demarcation” where an elastic artery suddenly becomes muscular.
