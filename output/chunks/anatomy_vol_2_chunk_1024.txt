When the membrane potential reaches approximately —60 mV, the K* channels close and

Na® channels open, and the prepotential phase begins again. This phenomenon explains the autorhythmicity properties o
cardiac muscle (Figure 19.20).

Figure 19.20 Action Potential at the SA Node The prepotential is due to a slow influx of sodium ions until the
threshold is reached followed by a rapid depolarization and repolarization. The prepotential accounts for the membrane
reaching threshold and initiates the spontaneous depolarization and contraction of the cell. Note the lack of a resting
potential.

 Membrane Potentials and lon Movement in Cardiac Contractile Cells

There is a distinctly different electrical pattern involving the contractile cells.
