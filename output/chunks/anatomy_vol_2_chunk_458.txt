(c) A branch can project through the white ramus communicans, but not terminate on a ganglionic neuron in
the chain. Instead, it projects through one of the splanchnic nerves to a collateral ganglion or the adrenal medulla (not
pictured).

 An axon from the central neuron that projects to a sympathetic ganglion is referred to as a preganglionic fiber
or neuron, and represents the output from the CNS to the ganglion. Because the sympathetic ganglia are adjacent to
the vertebral column, preganglionic sympathetic fibers are relatively short, and they are myelinated. A postganglionic
fiber—the axon from a ganglionic neuron that projects to the target effector—represents the output of a ganglion that
directly influences the organ. Compared with the preganglionic fibers, postganglionic sympathetic fibers are long because
of the relatively greater distance from the ganglion to the target effector. These fibers are unmyelinated. (Note that the term
“postganglionic neuron” may be used to describe the projection from a ganglion to the target.
