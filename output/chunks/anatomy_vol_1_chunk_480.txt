Stratum Lucidum

The stratum lucidum is a smooth, seemingly translucent layer of the epidermis located just above the stratum granulosum
and below the stratum corneum. This thin layer of cells is found only in the thick skin of the palms, soles, and digits. The
keratinocytes that compose the stratum lucidum are dead and flattened (see Figure 5.5). These cells are densely packed
with eleiden, a clear protein rich in lipids, derived from keratohyalin, which gives these cells their transparent (i.e., lucid)
appearance and provides a barrier to water.

 Stratum Corneum

The stratum corneum is the most superficial layer of the epidermis and is the layer exposed to the outside environment
(see Figure 5.5). The increased keratinization (also called cornification) of the cells in this layer gives it its name. There are
usually 15 to 30 layers of cells in the stratum corneum. This dry, dead layer helps prevent the penetration of microbes and the
dehydration of underlying tissues, and provides a mechanical protection against abrasion for the more delicate, underlying
layers.
