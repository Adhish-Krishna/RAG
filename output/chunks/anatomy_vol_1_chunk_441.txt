Cornelius Celsus is credited with documenting these signs during the days of the Roman Empire, as early as the first century
AD. A fifth sign, loss of function, may also accompany inflammation.
 Upon tissue injury, damaged cells release inflammatory chemical signals that evoke local vasodilation, the widening
of the blood vessels. Increased blood flow results in apparent redness and heat. In response to injury, mast cells present
in tissue degranulate, releasing the potent vasodilator histamine. Increased blood flow and inflammatory mediators recruit
white blood cells to the site of inflammation. The endothelium lining the local blood vessel becomes “leaky” under the
influence of histamine and other inflammatory mediators allowing neutrophils, macrophages, and fluid to move from the
blood into the interstitial tissue spaces. The excess liquid in tissue causes swelling, more properly called edema. The swollen
tissues squeezing pain receptors cause the sensation of pain. Prostaglandins released from injured cells also activate pain
neurons. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce pain because they inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins.
