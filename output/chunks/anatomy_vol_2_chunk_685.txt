Hormones are transported primarily via the bloodstream throughout the body, where they bind to receptors on target
cells, inducing a characteristic response. As a result, endocrine signaling requires more time than neural signaling to prompt
a response in target cells, though the precise amount of time varies with different hormones. For example, the hormones
released when you are confronted with a dangerous or frightening situation, called the fight-or-flight response, occur by the
release of adrenal hormones—epinephrine and norepinephrine—within seconds. In contrast, it may take up to 48 hours for
target cells to respond to certain reproductive hormones.

hormone binds to a cell membrane receptor. What is the secondary messenger made by adenylyl cyclase during the
activation of liver cells by epinephrine?

 In addition, endocrine signaling is typically less specific than neural signaling.
