Epithelial cells derive from all three major embryonic layers. The epithelia lining the skin, parts of the mouth and
nose, and the anus develop from the ectoderm. Cells lining the airways and most of the digestive system originate in the
endoderm. The epithelium that lines vessels in the lymphatic and cardiovascular system derives from the mesoderm and is
called an endothelium.

 All epithelia share some important structural and functional features. This tissue is highly cellular, with little or no
extracellular material present between cells. Adjoining cells form a specialized intercellular connection between their cell
membranes called a cell junction. The epithelial cells exhibit polarity with differences in structure and function between the
exposed or apical facing surface of the cell and the basal surface close to the underlying body structures. The basal lamina,
a mixture of glycoproteins and collagen, provides an attachment site for the epithelium, separating it from underlying
connective tissue.
