The urethra arises from the trigone area at the

Urination is controlled by an involuntary internal sphincter of smooth muscle and a voluntary externa
muscle. The shorter female urethra contributes to the higher incidence of bladder infections in femal

sphincter of skeletal
es. The male urethra

receives secretions from the prostate gland, Cowperâ€™s gland, and seminal vesicles as well as sperm. 1

The bladder is largely

retroperitoneal and can hold up to 500-600 mL urine. Micturition is the process of voiding the urine and involves both
involuntary and voluntary actions. Voluntary control of micturition requires a mature and intact sacral micturition center.
 It also requires an intact spinal cord. Loss of control of micturition is called incontinence and results in voiding when the
bladder contains about 250 mL urine. The ureters are retroperitoneal and lead from the renal pelvis of the kidney to the
trigone area at the base of the bladder.
