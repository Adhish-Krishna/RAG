Compliance

Compliance is the ability of any compartment to expand to accommodate increased content. A metal pipe, for example,
is not compliant, whereas a balloon is. The greater the compliance of an artery, the more effectively it is able to expand
to accommodate surges in blood flow without increased resistance or blood pressure. Veins are more compliant than
arteries and can expand to hold more blood. When vascular disease causes stiffening of arteries, compliance is reduced and
resistance to blood flow is increased. The result is more turbulence, higher pressure within the vessel, and reduced blood
flow. This increases the work of the heart.

 A Mathematical Approach to Factors Affecting Blood Flow

Jean Louis Marie Poiseuille was a French physician and physiologist who devised a mathematical equation describing
blood flow and its relationship to known parameters. The same equation also applies to engineering studies of the flow of
fluids. Although understanding the math behind the relationships among the factors affecting blood flow is not necessary to

understand blood flow, it can help solidify an understanding of their relationships.
