The wave of
depolarization in a normal sinus rhythm shows a stable resting HR. Following parasympathetic stimulation, HR slows.
 Following sympathetic stimulation, HR increases.

 Input to the Cardiovascular Center

The cardiovascular center receives input from a series of visceral receptors with impulses traveling through visceral sensory
â€˜ibers within the vagus and sympathetic nerves via the cardiac plexus. Among these receptors are various proprioreceptors,
baroreceptors, and chemoreceptors, plus stimuli from the limbic system. Collectively, these inputs normally enable the
cardiovascular centers to regulate heart function precisely, a process known as cardiac reflexes. Increased physical activity
results in increased rates of firing by various proprioreceptors located in muscles, joint capsules, and tendons. Any such
increase in physical activity would logically warrant increased blood flow. The cardiac centers monitor these increased rates
of firing, and suppress parasympathetic stimulation and increase sympathetic stimulation as needed in order to increase
blood flow.
