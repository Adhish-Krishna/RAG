A polyribosome is a string of ribosomes translating a single mRNA strand.

 Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ribosome) to learn about ribosomes. The ribosome binds to the mRNA
molecule to start translation of its code into a protein. What happens to the small and large ribosomal subunits at the
end of translation?

3.5 | Cell Growth and Division

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the stages of the cell cycle
 ¢ Discuss how the cell cycle is regulated
¢ Describe the implications of losing control over the cell cycle
¢ Describe the stages of mitosis and cytokinesis, in order

So far in this chapter, you have read numerous times of the importance and prevalence of cell division. While there are a
few cells in the body that do not undergo cell division (such as gametes, red blood cells, most neurons, and some muscle
cells), most somatic cells divide regularly.
