These hormones are stored or released into the blood via the capillary plexus.

 The posterior pituitary gland does not produce hormones, but rather stores and secretes hormones produced by the
hypothalamus. The paraventricular nuclei produce the hormone oxytocin, whereas the supraoptic nuclei produce ADH.
 These hormones travel along the axons into storage sites in the axon terminals of the posterior pituitary. In response to
signals from the same hypothalamic neurons, the hormones are released from the axon terminals into the bloodstream.

 Oxytocin

When fetal development is complete, the peptide-derived hormone oxytocin (tocia- = “childbirth”) stimulates uterine
contractions and dilation of the cervix. Throughout most of pregnancy, oxytocin hormone receptors are not expressed at high
levels in the uterus. Toward the end of pregnancy, the synthesis of oxytocin receptors in the uterus increases, and the smooth
muscle cells of the uterus become more sensitive to its effects.
