By constantly adjusting their
strength of contraction to resist forces acting on the shoulder, these muscles serve as “dynamic ligaments” and thus provide
the primary structural support for the glenohumeral joint.

 Injuries to the shoulder joint are common. Repetitive use of the upper limb, particularly in abduction such as during
throwing, swimming, or racquet sports, may lead to acute or chronic inflammation of the bursa or muscle tendons, a tear of
the glenoid labrum, or degeneration or tears of the rotator cuff. Because the humeral head is strongly supported by muscles
and ligaments around its anterior, superior, and posterior aspects, most dislocations of the humerus occur in an inferior
direction. This can occur when force is applied to the humerus when the upper limb is fully abducted, as when diving to
catch a baseball and landing on your hand or elbow.
