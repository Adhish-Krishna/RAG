The cerebral cortex also maintains this sensory topography in the particular areas of the cortex that correspond to the
position of the receptor cells. The somatosensory cortex provides an example in which, in essence, the locations of the
somatosensory receptors in the body are mapped onto the somatosensory cortex. This mapping is often depicted using a
sensory homunculus (Figure 14.23).

 The term homunculus comes from the Latin word for “little man” and refers to a map of the human body that is
laid across a portion of the cerebral cortex. In the somatosensory cortex, the external genitals, feet, and lower legs are
represented on the medial face of the gyrus within the longitudinal fissure. As the gyrus curves out of the fissure and
along the surface of the parietal lobe, the body map continues through the thighs, hips, trunk, shoulders, arms, and hands.
