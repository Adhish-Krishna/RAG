9.7 Development of Joints

During embryonic growth, bones and joints develop from mesenchyme, an embryonic tissue that gives rise to bone,
cartilage, and fibrous connective tissues. In the skull, the bones develop either directly from mesenchyme through the
process of intramembranous ossification, or indirectly through endochondral ossification, which initially forms a hyaline
cartilage model of the future bone, which is later converted into bone. In both cases, the mesenchyme between the
