The human body contains approximately 10! lymphocytes.
 B Cells

B cells are immune cells that function primarily by producing antibodies. An antibody is any of the group of proteins that
binds specifically to pathogen-associated molecules known as antigens. An antigen is a chemical structure on the surface
of a pathogen that binds to T or B lymphocyte antigen receptors. Once activated by binding to antigen, B cells differentiate
into cells that secrete a soluble form of their surface antibodies. These activated B cells are known as plasma cells.

 T Cells

The T cell, on the other hand, does not secrete antibody but performs a variety of functions in the adaptive immune response.
 Different T cell types have the ability to either secrete soluble factors that communicate with other cells of the adaptive
immune response or destroy cells infected with intracellular pathogens. The roles of T and B lymphocytes in the adaptive
immune response will be discussed further in this chapter.
