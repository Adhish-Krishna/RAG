Specialized cells in the kidneys found in the juxtaglomerular apparatus respond to decreased blood flow by
secreting renin into the blood. Renin converts the plasma protein angiotensinogen, which is produced by the liver, into its
active formâ€”angiotensin I. Angiotensin I circulates in the blood and is then converted into angiotensin II in the lungs. This
reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).

Angiotensin II is a powerful vasoconstrictor, greatly increasing blood pressure. It also stimulates the release of ADH
and aldosterone, a hormone produced by the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone increases the reabsorption of sodium into the blood
by the kidneys. Since water follows sodium, this increases the reabsorption of water. This in turn increases blood volume,
raising blood pressure. Angiotensin II also stimulates the thirst center in the hypothalamus, so an individual will likely
consume more fluids, again increasing blood volume and pressure.
