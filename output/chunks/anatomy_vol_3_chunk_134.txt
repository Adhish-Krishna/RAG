The air pressure within the lungs increases to above

the pressure of the atmosphere, causing air to be forced out of the lungs. However, during forced exhalation, the internal
intercostals and abdominal muscles may be involved in forcing air out of the lungs.

 Respiratory volume describes the amount of air in a given space within the lungs, or which can be moved by the lung,
and is dependent on a variety of factors. Tidal volume refers to the amount of air that enters the lungs during quiet breathing,
whereas inspiratory reserve volume is the amount of air that enters the lungs when a person inhales past the tidal volume.
 Expiratory reserve volume is the extra amount of air that can leave with forceful expiration, following tidal expiration.
 Residual volume is the amount of air that is left in the lungs after expelling the expiratory reserve volume. Respiratory
capacity is the combination of two or more volumes. Anatomical dead space refers to the air within the respiratory structures
that never participates in gas exchange, because it does not reach functional alveoli.
