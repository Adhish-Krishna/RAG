The brain and spinal cord can be thought of as a collection of smaller organs, most of which would be the
nuclei (such as the oculomotor nuclei), but white matter structures play an important role (such as the corpus callosum).
 Studying the nervous system requires an understanding of the varied physiology of the nervous system. For example, the
hypothalamus plays a very different role than the visual cortex. The neurological exam provides a way to elicit behavior
that represents those varied functions.

 16.1 | Overview of the Neurological Exam

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ List the major sections of the neurological exam
¢ Explain the connection between location and function in the nervous system
¢ Explain the benefit of a rapid assessment for neurological function in a clinical setting
¢ List the causes of neurological deficits
* Describe the different ischemic events in the nervous system

The neurological exam is a clinical assessment tool used to determine what specific parts of the CNS are affected by
damage or disease.
