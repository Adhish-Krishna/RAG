When compromised
through a mutation, or otherwise altered, proto-oncogenes can be converted to oncogenes, which produce oncoproteins
that push a cell forward in its cycle and stimulate cell division even when it is undesirable to do so. For example, a cel
that should be programmed to self-destruct (a process called apoptosis) due to extensive DNA damage might instead
be triggered to proliferate by an oncoprotein. On the other hand, a dysfunctional tumor suppressor gene may fail to
provide the cell with a necessary stop signal, also resulting in unwanted cell division and proliferation.

 A delicate homeostatic balance between the many proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes delicately
controls the cell cycle and ensures that only healthy cells replicate. Therefore, a disruption of this homeostatic balance
can cause aberrant cell division and cancerous growths.

CHAPTER 3 | THE CELLULAR LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION 119

3.6 | Cellular Differentiation

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

* Discuss how the generalized cells of a developing embryo or the stem cells of an adult organism become
differentiated into specialized cells

¢ Distinguish between the categories of stem cells

How does a complex organism such as a human develop from a single cell—a fertilized egg—into the vast array of
cell types such as nerve cells, muscle cells, and epithelial cells that characterize the adult?
