The loss of an electron, or oxidation, releases a small amount of energy; both the electron
and the energy are then passed to another molecule in the process of reduction, or the gaining of an electron. These two
reactions always happen together in an oxidation-reduction reaction (also called a redox reaction)â€”when an electron is
passed between molecules, the donor is oxidized and the recipient is reduced. Oxidation-reduction reactions often happen
in a series, so that a molecule that is reduced is subsequently oxidized, passing on not only the electron it just received but
also the energy it received. As the series of reactions progresses, energy accumulates that is used to combine Pj and ADP to

form ATP, the high-energy molecule that the body uses for fuel.

 Oxidation-reduction reactions are catalyzed by enzymes that trigger the removal of hydrogen atoms. Coenzymes
work with enzymes and accept hydrogen atoms. The two most common coenzymes of oxidation-reduction reactions are

nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD).
