The kidneys must
produce a minimum urine volume of about 500 mL/day to rid the body of wastes. Output below this level may be caused
by severe dehydration or renal disease and is termed oliguria. The virtual absence of urine production is termed anuria.
 Excessive urine production is polyuria, which may be due to diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus. In diabetes mellitus,
blood glucose levels exceed the number of available sodium-glucose transporters in the kidney, and glucose appears in
the urine. The osmotic nature of glucose attracts water, leading to its loss in the urine. In the case of diabetes insipidus,
insufficient pituitary antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release or insufficient numbers of ADH receptors in the collecting ducts
means that too few water channels are inserted into the cell membranes that line the collecting ducts of the kidney.
