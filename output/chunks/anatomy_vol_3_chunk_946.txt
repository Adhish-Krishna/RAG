44 The densely packed
concentric rings of matrix in compact bone are ideal for resisting compressive forces, which is the function of compact bone. The
open spaces of the trabeculated network of spongy bone allow spongy bone to support shifts in weight distribution, which is the
function of spongy bone. 45 In intramembranous ossification, bone develops directly from sheets of mesenchymal connective
tissue, but in endochondral ossification, bone develops by replacing hyaline cartilage. Intramembranous ossification is complete
by the end of the adolescent growth spurt, while endochondral ossification lasts into young adulthood. The flat bones of the face,
most of the cranial bones, and a good deal of the clavicles (collarbones) are formed via intramembranous ossification, while bones
at the base of the skull and the long bones form via endochondral ossification.
