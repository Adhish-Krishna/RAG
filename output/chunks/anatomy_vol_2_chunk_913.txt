With RBCs in particular, you may see the antigens
referred to as isoantigens or agglutinogens (surface antigens) and the antibodies referred to as isoantibodies or agglutinins.
 In this chapter, we will use the more common terms antigens and antibodies.

 Antigens are generally large proteins, but may include other classes of organic molecules, including carbohydrates,
lipids, and nucleic acids. Following an infusion of incompatible blood, erythrocytes with foreign antigens appear in the
bloodstream and trigger an immune response. Proteins called antibodies (immunoglobulins), which are produced by certain
B lymphocytes called plasma cells, attach to the antigens on the plasma membranes of the infused erythrocytes and cause
them to adhere to one another.

* Because the arms of the Y-shaped antibodies attach randomly to more than one nonself erythrocyte surface, they form
clumps of erythrocytes. This process is called agglutination.
 Â¢ The clumps of erythrocytes block small blood vessels throughout the body, depriving tissues of oxygen and nutrients.
