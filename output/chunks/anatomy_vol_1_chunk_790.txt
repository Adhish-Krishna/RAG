The proximal end of each metacarpal bone articulates with one of the
distal carpal bones. Each of these articulations is a carpometacarpal joint (see Figure 8.8). The expanded distal end of
each metacarpal bone articulates at the metacarpophalangeal joint with the proximal phalanx bone of the thumb or one
of the fingers. The distal end also forms the knuckles of the hand, at the base of the fingers. The metacarpal bones are
numbered 1-5, beginning at the thumb.

 The first metacarpal bone, at the base of the thumb, is separated from the other metacarpal bones. This allows it a
freedom of motion that is independent of the other metacarpal bones, which is very important for thumb mobility. The
remaining metacarpal bones are united together to form the palm of the hand. The second and third metacarpal bones are
firmly anchored in place and are immobile. However, the fourth and fifth metacarpal bones have limited anterior-posterior
mobility, a motion that is greater for the fifth bone.
