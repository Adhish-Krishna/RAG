If the fast is not broken and starvation begins to set in, during the initial days, glucose produced from
gluconeogenesis is still used by the brain and organs. After a few days, however, ketone bodies are created from fats and
serve as the preferential fuel source for the heart and other organs, so that the brain can still use glucose. Once these stores
are depleted, proteins will be catabolized first from the organs with fast turnover, such as the intestinal lining. Muscle will
be spared to prevent the wasting of muscle tissue; however, these proteins will be used if alternative stores are not available.

 24.6 Energy and Heat Balance

Some of the energy from the food that is ingested is used to maintain the core temperature of the body. Most of the energy
derived from the food is released as heat. The core temperature is kept around 36.5-37.5 °C (97.7-99.5 °F).
