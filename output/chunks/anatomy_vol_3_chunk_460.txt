This reflex may be preserved even in the face of spinal cord injury that results in paraplegia
or quadriplegia. However, relaxation of the external sphincter may not be possible in all cases, and therefore, periodic
catheterization may be necessary for bladder emptying.

 Nerves involved in the control of urination include the hypogastric, pelvic, and pudendal (Figure 25.5). Voluntary
micturition requires an intact spinal cord and functional pudendal nerve arising from the sacral micturition center.
 Since the external urinary sphincter is voluntary skeletal muscle, actions by cholinergic neurons maintain contraction (and
thereby continence) during filling of the bladder. At the same time, sympathetic nervous activity via the hypogastric nerves
suppresses contraction of the detrusor muscle. With further bladder stretch, afferent signals traveling over sacral pelvic
nerves activate parasympathetic neurons. This activates efferent neurons to release acetylcholine at the neuromuscular
junctions, producing detrusor contraction and bladder emptying.
