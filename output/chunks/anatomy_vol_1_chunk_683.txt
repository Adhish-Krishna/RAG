This opening provides for passage of the nerve from the hearing and equilibrium organs of the inner ear, and the
nerve that supplies the muscles of the face. Located at the anterior-lateral margin of the foramen magnum is the hypoglossal
canal. These emerge on the inferior aspect of the skull at the base of the occipital condyle and provide passage for an
important nerve to the tongue.

 Immediately inferior to the internal acoustic meatus is the large, irregularly shaped jugular foramen (see Figure 7.8a).
 Several cranial nerves from the brain exit the skull via this opening. It is also the exit point through the base of the skull
for all the venous return blood leaving the brain. The venous structures that carry blood inside the skull form large, curved
grooves on the inner walls of the posterior cranial fossa, which terminate at each jugular foramen.
