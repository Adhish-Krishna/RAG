Figure 12.24 Stages of an Action Potential Plotting voltage measured across the cell membrane against time, the
events of the action potential can be related to specific changes in the membrane voltage. (1) At rest, the membrane
voltage is -70 mV. (2) The membrane begins to depolarize when an external stimulus is applied. (3) The membrane
voltage begins a rapid rise toward +30 mV. (4) The membrane voltage starts to return to a negative value. (5)
Repolarization continues past the resting membrane voltage, resulting in hyperpolarization. (6) The membrane voltage
returns to the resting value shortly after hyperpolarization.

Propagation of the Action Potential

The action potential is initiated at the beginning of the axon, at what is called the initial segment.
