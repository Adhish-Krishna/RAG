If DNA replication did not take place fully, or at all, the offspring cells would be missing some or
all of the genome. This could be disastrous if a cell was missing genes necessary for its function and health. 37 Transcription
and DNA replication both involve the synthesis of nucleic acids. These processes share many common features—particularly, the
similar processes of initiation, elongation, and termination. In both cases the DNA molecule must be untwisted and separated,
and the coding (i.e., sense) strand will be used as a template. Also, polymerases serve to add nucleotides to the growing DNA
or mRNA strand. Both processes are signaled to terminate when completed. 38 Transcription is really a “copy” process and
translation is really an “interpretation” process, because transcription involves copying the DNA message into a very similar RNA
message whereas translation involves converting the RNA message into the very different amino acid message.
