The precursor hemangioblasts differentiate into angioblasts,
which give rise to the blood vessels and pluripotent stem cells that differentiate into the formed elements of the blood.
 Together, these cells form blood islands scattered throughout the embryo. Extensions known as vascular tubes eventually
connect the vascular network. As the embryo grows within the motherâ€™s womb, the placenta develops to supply blood rich
in oxygen and nutrients via the umbilical vein and to remove wastes in oxygen-depleted blood via the umbilical arteries.
 Three major shunts found in the fetus are the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus, which divert blood from the pulmonary
to the systemic circuit, and the ductus venosus, which carries freshly oxygenated blood high in nutrients to the fetal heart.
