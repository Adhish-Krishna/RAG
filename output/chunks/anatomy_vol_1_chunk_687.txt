The hyoid serves as the base for the tongue above, and is attached to the larynx below and the pharynx
posteriorly. The hyoid is held in position by a series of small muscles that attach to it either from above or below. These
muscles act to move the hyoid up/down or forward/back. Movements of the hyoid are coordinated with movements of the
tongue, larynx, and pharynx during swallowing and speaking.

Figure 7.19 Hyoid Bone The hyoid bone is located in the upper neck and does not join with any other bone. It
provides attachments for muscles that act on the tongue, larynx, and pharynx.

 7.3 | The Vertebral Column

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Describe each region of the vertebral column and the number of bones in each region
Discuss the curves of the vertebral column and how these change after birth

Describe a typical vertebra and determine the distinguishing characteristics for vertebrae in each vertebral region
and features of the sacrum and the coccyx

Define the structure of an intervertebral disc
Determine the location of the ligaments that provide support for the vertebral column

The vertebral column is also known as the spinal column or spine (Figure 7.20).
