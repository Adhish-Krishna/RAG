Anabolic steroid use has been linked to infertility, aggressive behavior, cardiovascular disease, and brain cancer.

 Similarly, some athletes have used creatine to increase power output. Creatine phosphate provides quick bursts of ATP
to muscles in the initial stages of contraction. Increasing the amount of creatine available to cells is thought to produce more
ATP and therefore increase explosive power output, although its effectiveness as a supplement has been questioned.

Aging and Muscle Tissue

Although atrophy due to disuse can often be reversed with exercise, muscle atrophy with age, referred to as sarcopenia,
is irreversible. This is a primary reason why even highly trained athletes succumb to declining performance with
age. This decline is noticeable in athletes whose sports require strength and powerful movements, such as sprinting,
whereas the effects of age are less noticeable in endurance athletes such as marathon runners or long-distance cyclists.
