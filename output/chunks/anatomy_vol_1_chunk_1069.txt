The primary metabolic pathway
used by a muscle fiber determines whether the fiber is classified as oxidative or glycolytic. If a fiber primarily produces
ATP through aerobic pathways it is oxidative. More ATP can be produced during each metabolic cycle, making the fiber
more resistant to fatigue. Glycolytic fibers primarily create ATP through anaerobic glycolysis, which produces less ATP per
cycle. As a result, glycolytic fibers fatigue at a quicker rate.

 The oxidative fibers contain many more mitochondria than the glycolytic fibers, because aerobic metabolism, which
uses oxygen (O2) in the metabolic pathway, occurs in the mitochondria. The SO fibers possess a large number of
mitochondria and are capable of contracting for longer periods because of the large amount of ATP they can produce, but
they have a relatively small diameter and do not produce a large amount of tension.
