Smell is the one sensory modality that does not synapse in the thalamus before
connecting to the cerebral cortex. This intimate connection between the olfactory system and the cerebral cortex is one
reason why smell can be a potent trigger of memories and emotion.

 The nasal epithelium, including the olfactory cells, can be harmed by airborne toxic chemicals. Therefore, the olfactory
neurons are regularly replaced within the nasal epithelium, after which the axons of the new neurons must find their
appropriate connections in the olfactory bulb. These new axons grow along the axons that are already in place in the cranial
nerve.
