At one time, it was assumed that all types of stress reduced all aspects of the immune response, but the last few
decades of research have painted a different picture. First, most short-term stress does not impair the immune system
in healthy individuals enough to lead to a greater incidence of diseases. However, older individuals and those with
suppressed immune responses due to disease or immunosuppressive drugs may respond even to short-term stressors
by getting sicker more often. It has been found that short-term stress diverts the bodyâ€™s resources towards enhancing
innate immune responses, which have the ability to act fast and would seem to help the body prepare better for possible
infections associated with the trauma that may result from a fight-or-flight exchange.
