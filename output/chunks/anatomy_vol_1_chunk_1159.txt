Post-surgery, the anesthesiologist gradually changes the
mixture of the gases that keep the patient unconscious, and when the muscles of respiration begin to function, the tube
is removed. It still takes about 30 minutes for a patient to wake up, and for breathing muscles to regain control of
respiration. After surgery, most people have a sore or scratchy throat for a few days.

 Muscles of the Anterior Neck

The muscles of the anterior neck assist in deglutition (swallowing) and speech by controlling the positions of the larynx
(voice box), and the hyoid bone, a horseshoe-shaped bone that functions as a solid foundation on which the tongue can
move. The muscles of the neck are categorized according to their position relative to the hyoid bone (Figure 11.13).
 Suprahyoid muscles are superior to it, and the infrahyoid muscles are located inferiorly.
