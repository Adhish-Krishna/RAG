The Frequency of Motor Neuron Stimulation

A single action potential from a motor neuron will produce a single contraction in the muscle fibers of its motor unit. This
isolated contraction is called a twitch. A twitch can last for a few milliseconds or 100 milliseconds, depending on the muscle
type. The tension produced by a single twitch can be measured by a myogram, an instrument that measures the amount
of tension produced over time (Figure 10.15). Each twitch undergoes three phases. The first phase is the latent period,

during which the action potential is being propagated along the sarcolemma and Ca‚Äù ions are released from the SR. This
is the phase during which excitation and contraction are being coupled but contraction has yet to occur. The contraction

phase occurs next. The Ca" ions in the sarcoplasm have bound to troponin, tropomyosin has shifted away from actin-
binding sites, cross-bridges formed, and sarcomeres are actively shortening to the point of peak tension.
