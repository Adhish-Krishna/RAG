Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/occipital) to learn more about a transverse section through the brain
that depicts the visual pathway from the eye to the occipital cortex. The first half of the pathway is the projection from
the RGCs through the optic nerve to the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus on either side.
