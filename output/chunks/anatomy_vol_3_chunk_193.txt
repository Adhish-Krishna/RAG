In fact, an average of 1 to 1.5 liters of saliva is secreted each day. Usually just enough saliva is present to moisten the mouth
and teeth. Secretion increases when you eat, because saliva is essential to moisten food and initiate the chemical breakdown
of carbohydrates. Small amounts of saliva are also secreted by the labial glands in the lips. In addition, the buccal glands in
the cheeks, palatal glands in the palate, and lingual glands in the tongue help ensure that all areas of the mouth are supplied
with adequate saliva.

 The Major Salivary Glands

Outside the oral mucosa are three pairs of major salivary glands, which secrete the majority of saliva into ducts that open
into the mouth:
 ¢ The submandibular glands, which are in the floor of the mouth, secrete saliva into the mouth through the
submandibular ducts.
 ¢ The sublingual glands, which lie below the tongue, use the lesser sublingual ducts to secrete saliva into the oral cavity.
