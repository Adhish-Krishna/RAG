The cartilage model of
the rib then ossifies, except for the anterior portion, which remains as the costal cartilage. The sternum initially forms as
paired hyaline cartilage models on either side of the anterior midline, beginning during the fifth week of development. The
cartilage models of the ribs become attached to the lateral sides of the developing sternum. Eventually, the two halves of the
cartilaginous sternum fuse together along the midline and then ossify into bone. The manubrium and body of the sternum
are converted into bone first, with the xiphoid process remaining as cartilage until late in life.
