Passageways in the lungs
become blocked with mucus, along with the debris it carries. Bacterial infections occur more easily because bacterial
cells are not effectively carried away from the lungs.

 3.2 | The Cytoplasm and Cellular Organelles

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

¢ Describe the structure and function of the cellular organelles associated with the endomembrane system, including
the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes

¢ Describe the structure and function of mitochondria and peroxisomes
¢ Explain the three components of the cytoskeleton, including their composition and functions

Now that you have learned that the cell membrane surrounds all cells, you can dive inside of a prototypical human cell
to learn about its internal components and their functions. All living cells in multicellular organisms contain an internal
cytoplasmic compartment, and a nucleus within the cytoplasm. Cytosol, the jelly-like substance within the cell, provides
the fluid medium necessary for biochemical reactions.
