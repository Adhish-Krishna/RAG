The electron transport chain consists of a series of four enzyme complexes (Complex I â€”
Complex IV) and two coenzymes (ubiquinone and Cytochrome c), which act as electron carriers and proton pumps used to

transfer H" ions into the space between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes (Figure 24.8). The ETC couples the
transfer of electrons between a donor (like NADH) and an electron acceptor (like Oz) with the transfer of protons (H* ions)
across the inner mitochondrial membrane, enabling the process of oxidative phosphorylation. In the presence of oxygen,
energy is passed, stepwise, through the electron carriers to collect gradually the energy needed to attach a phosphate to ADP
and produce ATP. The role of molecular oxygen, Og, is as the terminal electron acceptor for the ETC. This means that once
the electrons have passed through the entire ETC, they must be passed to another, separate molecule.
