Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/skull1) to view a rotating and exploded skull, with color-coded bones.
Which bone (yellow) is centrally located and joins with most of the other bones of the skull?

Anterior View of Skull

The anterior skull consists of the facial bones and provides the bony support for the eyes and structures of the face. This
view of the skull is dominated by the openings of the orbits and the nasal cavity. Also seen are the upper and lower jaws,
with their respective teeth (Figure 7.4).

 The orbit is the bony socket that houses the eyeball and muscles that move the eyeball or open the upper eyelid. The
upper margin of the anterior orbit is the supraorbital margin. Located near the midpoint of the supraorbital margin is a
small opening called the supraorbital foramen. This provides for passage of a sensory nerve to the skin of the forehead.
 Below the orbit is the infraorbital foramen, which is the point of emergence for a sensory nerve that supplies the anterior
face below the orbit.
