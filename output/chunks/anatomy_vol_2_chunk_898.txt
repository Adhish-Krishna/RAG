The process is complex, but is initiated along two basic pathways:
¢ The extrinsic pathway, which normally is triggered by trauma.
 ¢ The intrinsic pathway, which begins in the bloodstream and is triggered by internal damage to the wall of the vessel.
 Both of these merge into a third pathway, referred to as the common pathway (see Figure 18.14b). All three pathways
are dependent upon the 12 known clotting factors, including Ca** and vitamin K (Table 18.1). Clotting factors are secreted

primarily by the liver and the platelets. The liver requires the fat-soluble vitamin K to produce many of them. Vitamin K
(along with biotin and folate) is somewhat unusual among vitamins in that it is not only consumed in the diet but is also
