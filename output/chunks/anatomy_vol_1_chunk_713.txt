The posterior bulging of the nucleus pulposus can cause compression of
a spinal nerve at the point where it exits through the intervertebral foramen, with resulting pain and/or muscle weakness in
those body regions supplied by that nerve. The most common sites for disc herniation are the L4/L5 or L5/S1 intervertebral
discs, which can cause sciatica, a widespread pain that radiates from the lower back down the thigh and into the leg. Similar
injuries of the C5/C6 or C6/C7 intervertebral discs, following forcible hyperflexion of the neck from a collision accident or
football injury, can produce pain in the neck, shoulder, and upper limb.
