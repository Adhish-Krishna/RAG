The maternal portion of the placenta develops from the deepest layer of the endometrium, the decidua basalis. To form
the embryonic portion of the placenta, the syncytiotrophoblast and the underlying cells of the trophoblast (cytotrophoblast
cells) begin to proliferate along with a layer of extraembryonic mesoderm cells. These form the chorionic membrane,
which envelops the entire conceptus as the chorion. The chorionic membrane forms finger-like structures called chorionic
villi that burrow into the endometrium like tree roots, making up the fetal portion of the placenta. The cytotrophoblast
cells perforate the chorionic villi, burrow farther into the endometrium, and remodel maternal blood vessels to augment
maternal blood flow surrounding the villi. Meanwhile, fetal mesenchymal cells derived from the mesoderm fill the villi
and differentiate into blood vessels, including the three umbilical blood vessels that connect the embryo to the developing
placenta (Figure 28.11).
