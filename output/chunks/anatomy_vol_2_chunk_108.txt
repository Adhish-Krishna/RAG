The description above conveniently glosses over that point.
 But it is vital to understanding what is happening. The membrane potential will stay at the resting voltage until something

changes. The description above just says that a Na” channel opens. Now, to say “a channel opens” does not mean that one
individual transmembrane protein changes. Instead, it means that one kind of channel opens. There are a few different types
of channels that allow Na* to cross the membrane. A ligand-gated Na* channel will open when a neurotransmitter binds
to it and a mechanically gated Na” channel will open when a physical stimulus affects a sensory receptor (like pressure
applied to the skin compresses a touch receptor). Whether it is a neurotransmitter binding to its receptor protein or a sensory
stimulus activating a sensory receptor cell, some stimulus gets the process started. Sodium starts to enter the cell and the
membrane becomes less negative.

 A third type of channel that is an important part of depolarization in the action potential is the voltage-gated Na”
channel.
