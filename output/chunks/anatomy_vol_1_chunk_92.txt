(a) Abdominopelvic regions (b) Abdominopelvic quandrants

Figure 1.16 Regions and Quadrants of the Peritoneal Cavity There are (a) nine abdominal regions and (b) four
abdominal quadrants in the peritoneal cavity.

 The more detailed regional approach subdivides the cavity with one horizontal line immediately inferior to the ribs
and one immediately superior to the pelvis, and two vertical lines drawn as if dropped from the midpoint of each clavicle
(collarbone). There are nine resulting regions. The simpler quadrants approach, which is more commonly used in medicine,
subdivides the cavity with one horizontal and one vertical line that intersect at the patientâ€™s umbilicus (navel).

 Membranes of the Anterior (Ventral) Body Cavity

A serous membrane (also referred to a serosa) is one of the thin membranes that cover the walls and organs in the thoracic
and abdominopelvic cavities.
