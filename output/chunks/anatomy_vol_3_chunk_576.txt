Understanding the
ways in which the body maintains these critical balances is key to understanding good health.

 26.1 | Body Fluids and Fluid Compartments

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Explain the importance of water in the body
* Contrast the composition of the intracellular fluid with that of the extracellular fluid
¢ Explain the importance of protein channels in the movement of solutes

* Identify the causes and symptoms of edema

The chemical reactions of life take place in aqueous solutions. The dissolved substances in a solution are called solutes.
 In the human body, solutes vary in different parts of the body, but may include proteins—including those that transport
lipids, carbohydrates, and, very importantly, electrolytes. Often in medicine, a mineral dissociated from a salt that carries an
electrical charge (an ion) is called and electrolyte. For instance, sodium ions (Na*) and chloride ions (Cl’) are often referred
to as electrolytes.
