CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 887

Arteries Serving the Lower Limbs

The external iliac artery exits the body cavity and enters the femoral region of the lower leg (Figure 20.33). As it passes
through the body wall, it is renamed the femoral artery. It gives off several smaller branches as well as the lateral deep
femoral artery that in turn gives rise to a lateral circumflex artery. These arteries supply blood to the deep muscles of
the thigh as well as ventral and lateral regions of the integument. The femoral artery also gives rise to the genicular artery,
which provides blood to the region of the knee.
