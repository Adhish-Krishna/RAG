artificial hearts to augment the severely limited supply of heart donors has proven less than satisfactory but will likely

 MIs may trigger cardiac arrest, but the two are not synonymous. Important risk factors for MI include
cardiovascular disease, age, smoking, high blood levels of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL, often referred to as “bad”
cholesterol), low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL, or “good” cholesterol), hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
obesity, lack of physical exercise, chronic kidney disease, excessive alcohol consumption, and use of illegal drugs.
