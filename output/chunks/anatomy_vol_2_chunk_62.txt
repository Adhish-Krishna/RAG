Neurons are dynamic cells with the ability to make a vast number of connections, to respond incredibly
quickly to stimuli, and to initiate movements on the basis of those stimuli. They are the focus of intense research
because failures in physiology can lead to devastating illnesses. Why are neurons only found in animals? Based on
what this article says about neuron function, why wouldn't they be helpful for plants or microorganisms?

 Types of Neurons

There are many neurons in the nervous systemâ€”a number in the trillions. And there are many different types of neurons.
 They can be classified by many different criteria. The first way to classify them is by the number of processes attached to
the cell body. Using the standard model of neurons, one of these processes is the axon, and the rest are dendrites. Because
information flows through the neuron from dendrites or cell bodies toward the axon, these names are based on the neuron's
polarity (Figure 12.9).
