Free radicals are reactive because they
contain free unpaired electrons; they can easily oxidize other molecules throughout the cell, causing cellular damage and
even cell death. Free radicals are thought to play a role in many destructive processes in the body, from cancer to coronary
artery disease.

 Peroxisomes, on the other hand, oversee reactions that neutralize free radicals. Peroxisomes produce large amounts
of the toxic H2O2 in the process, but peroxisomes contain enzymes that convert H2O2 into water and oxygen. These
byproducts are safely released into the cytoplasm. Like miniature sewage treatment plants, peroxisomes neutralize harmful
toxins so that they do not wreak havoc in the cells. The liver is the organ primarily responsible for detoxifying the blood
before it travels throughout the body, and liver cells contain an exceptionally high number of peroxisomes.

 Defense mechanisms such as detoxification within the peroxisome and certain cellular antioxidants serve to neutralize
many of these molecules. Some vitamins and other substances, found primarily in fruits and vegetables, have antioxidant
properties.
