What causes the osteoclasts to become overactive? The answer is still unknown, but hereditary factors seem to
play a role. Some scientists believe Paget’s disease is due to an as-yet-unidentified virus.

 Paget’s disease is diagnosed via imaging studies and lab tests. X-rays may show bone deformities or areas of bone
resorption. Bone scans are also useful. In these studies, a dye containing a radioactive ion is injected into the body.
 Areas of bone resorption have an affinity for the ion, so they will light up on the scan if the ions are absorbed. In
addition, blood levels of an enzyme called alkaline phosphatase are typically elevated in people with Paget’s disease.

 Bisphosphonates, drugs that decrease the activity of osteoclasts, are often used in the treatment of Paget’s disease.
 However, in a small percentage of cases, bisphosphonates themselves have been linked to an increased risk of fractures
because the old bone that is left after bisphosphonates are administered becomes worn out and brittle.
