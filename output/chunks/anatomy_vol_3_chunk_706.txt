We inherit half of our nuclear DNA from our father, and half from our mother.
 However, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) comes only from the mitochondria in the cytoplasm of the fat ovum we inherit
from our mother. She received her mtDNA from her mother, who got it from her mother, and so on. Each of our cells
contains approximately 1700 mitochondria, with each mitochondrion packed with mtDNA containing approximately
37 genes.

 Mutations (changes) in mtDNA occur spontaneously in a somewhat organized pattern at regular intervals in
human history. By analyzing these mutational relationships, researchers have been able to determine that we can all
trace our ancestry back to one woman who lived in Africa about 200,000 years ago. Scientists have given this woman
the biblical name Eve, although she is not, of course, the first Homo sapiens female. More precisely, she is our most
recent common ancestor through matrilineal descent.

 This doesn’t mean that everyone’s mtDNA today looks exactly like that of our ancestral Eve.
