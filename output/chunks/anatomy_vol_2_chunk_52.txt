Sweat glands, for example, are controlled by the autonomic system. When you are hot, sweating helps
cool your body down. That is a homeostatic mechanism. But when you are nervous, you might start sweating also. That is
not homeostatic, it is the physiological response to an emotional state.

 There is another division of the nervous system that describes functional responses. The enteric nervous system
(ENS) is responsible for controlling the smooth muscle and glandular tissue in your digestive system. It is a large part of
the PNS, and is not dependent on the CNS. It is sometimes valid, however, to consider the enteric system to be a part of the
autonomic system because the neural structures that make up the enteric system are a component of the autonomic output
that regulates digestion.
