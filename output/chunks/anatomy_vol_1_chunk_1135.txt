Because of fascicles, a portion of a multipennate muscle like the deltoid can be stimulated by the nervous system to
change the direction of the pull. For example, when the deltoid muscle contracts, the arm abducts (moves away from midline
in the sagittal plane), but when only the anterior fascicle is stimulated, the arm will abduct and flex (move anteriorly at the
shoulder joint).


 420 CHAPTER 11 | THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM

The Lever System of Muscle and Bone Interactions

Skeletal muscles do not work by themselves. Muscles are arranged in pairs based on their functions. For muscles attached to
the bones of the skeleton, the connection determines the force, speed, and range of movement. These characteristics depend
on each other and can explain the general organization of the muscular and skeletal systems.

 The skeleton and muscles act together to move the body. Have you ever used the back of a hammer to remove a nail
from wood?
