After puberty, a few primordial follicles will respond to a recruitment signal each day, and will join a pool of immature

growing follicles called primary follicles. Primary follicles start with a single layer of granulosa cells, but the granulosa
cells then become active and transition from a flat or squamous shape to a rounded, cuboidal shape as they increase in size
and proliferate. As the granulosa cells divide, the follicles—now called secondary follicles (see Figure 27.12)—increase in
diameter, adding a new outer layer of connective tissue, blood vessels, and theca cells—cells that work with the granulosa

cells to produce estrogens.

 Within the growing secondary follicle, the primary oocyte now secretes a thin acellular membrane called the zona

pellucida that will play a critical role in fertilization. A thick fluid, called follicular fluid, that has formed between the
granulosa cells also begins to collect into one large pool, or antrum.
