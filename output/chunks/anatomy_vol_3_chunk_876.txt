Mendel performed thousands of crosses in pea plants with differing traits for a variety of characteristics. And he
repeatedly came up with the same results—among the traits he studied, one was always dominant, and the other was always
recessive. (Remember, however, that this dominant—recessive relationship between alleles is not always the case; some
alleles are codominant, and sometimes dominance is incomplete.)

 Using his understanding of dominant and recessive traits, Mendel tested whether a recessive trait could be lost
altogether in a pea lineage or whether it would resurface in a later generation. By crossing the second-generation offspring
of purebred parents with each other, he showed that the latter was true: recessive traits reappeared in third-generation plants
in a ratio of 3:1 (three offspring having the dominant trait and one having the recessive trait).
