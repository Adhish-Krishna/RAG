The superior nasal concha and middle nasal concha are parts of the ethmoid bone. The
inferior nasal concha is an independent bone of the skull.

 Sutures of the Skull

A suture is an immobile joint between adjacent bones of the skull. The narrow gap between the bones is filled with dense,
fibrous connective tissue that unites the bones. The long sutures located between the bones of the brain case are not straight,
but instead follow irregular, tightly twisting paths. These twisting lines serve to tightly interlock the adjacent bones, thus
adding strength to the skull for brain protection.

 The two suture lines seen on the top of the skull are the coronal and sagittal sutures. The coronal suture runs from side
to side across the skull, within the coronal plane of section (see Figure 7.5). It joins the frontal bone to the right and left
parietal bones. The sagittal suture extends posteriorly from the coronal suture, running along the midline at the top of the
skull in the sagittal plane of section (see Figure 7.9).
