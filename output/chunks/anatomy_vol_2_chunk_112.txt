The voltage-gated K* channel has only one gate, which is sensitive to a membrane voltage of -50 mV. However, it does
not open as quickly as the voltage-gated Na* channel does. It might take a fraction of a millisecond for the channel to open
once that voltage has been reached. The timing of this coincides exactly with when the Na” flow peaks, so voltage-gated K*
channels open just as the voltage-gated Na* channels are being inactivated. As the membrane potential repolarizes and the
voltage passes -50 mV again, the channel closes—again, with a little delay. Potassium continues to leave the cell for a short
while and the membrane potential becomes more negative, resulting in the hyperpolarizing overshoot. Then the channel
closes again and the membrane can return to the resting potential because of the ongoing activity of the non-gated channels
and the Na*/K* pump.
