These differences serve to divide the joints of the body into three structural classifications. A fibrous
joint is where the adjacent bones are united by fibrous connective tissue. At a cartilaginous joint, the bones are joined by
hyaline cartilage or fibrocartilage. At a synovial joint, the articulating surfaces of the bones are not directly connected, but
instead come into contact with each other within a joint cavity that is filled with a lubricating fluid. Synovial joints allow
for free movement between the bones and are the most common joints of the body.

 Functional Classification of Joints

The functional classification of joints is determined by the amount of mobility found between the adjacent bones. Joints
are thus functionally classified as a synarthrosis or immobile joint, an amphiarthrosis or slightly moveable joint, or as a
diarthrosis, which is a freely moveable joint (arthroun = “to fasten by a joint”). Depending on their location, fibrous joints
may be functionally classified as a synarthrosis (immobile joint) or an amphiarthrosis (slightly mobile joint).
