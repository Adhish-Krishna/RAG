This in turn helps to maintain both blood volume and
blood pressure. Albumin normally accounts for approximately 54 percent of the total plasma protein content, in clinical

levels of 3.5-5.0 g/dL blood.
 ¢ The second most common plasma proteins are the globulins. A

heterogeneous group, there are three main subgroups

known as alpha, beta, and gamma globulins. The alpha and beta globulins transport iron, lipids, and the fat-soluble
vitamins A, D, E, and K to the cells; like albumin, they also contribute to osmotic pressure. The gamma globulins are
proteins involved in immunity and are better known as an antibodies or immunoglobulins. Although other plasma

proteins are produced by the liver, immunoglobulins are produc

‘ed by specialized leukocytes known as plasma cells.

 (Seek additional content for more information about immunoglobulins.) Globulins make up approximately 38 percent
of the total plasma protein volume, in clinical levels of 1.0-1.5 g/dL blood.
