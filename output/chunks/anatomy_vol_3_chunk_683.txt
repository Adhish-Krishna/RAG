The shaft of the penis surrounds the urethra (Figure 27.7). The shaft is composed of three column-like chambers of
erectile tissue that span the length of the shaft. Each of the two larger lateral chambers is called a corpus cavernosum

(plural = corpora cavernosa). Together, these make up the bulk of the penis. The corpus spongiosum, which can be felt as a
raised ridge on the erect penis, is a smaller chamber that surrounds the spongy, or penile, urethra. The end of the penis, called
the glans penis, has a high concentration of nerve endings, resulting in very sensitive skin that influences the likelihood of
ejaculation (see Figure 27.2). The skin from the shaft extends down over the glans and forms a collar called the prepuce
(or foreskin). The foreskin also contains a dense concentration of nerve endings, and both lubricate and protect the sensitive
skin of the glans penis.
