Deglutition Deglutition includes the voluntary phase and two involuntary phases: the pharyngeal phase
and the esophageal phase.

 The Voluntary Phase

The voluntary phase of deglutition (also known as the oral or buccal phase) is so called because you can control when you
swallow food. In this phase, chewing has been completed and swallowing is set in motion. The tongue moves upward and
backward against the palate, pushing the bolus to the back of the oral cavity and into the oropharynx. Other muscles keep
the mouth closed and prevent food from falling out. At this point, the two involuntary phases of swallowing begin.

 The Pharyngeal Phase

 In the pharyngeal phase, stimulation of receptors in the oropharynx sends impulses to the deglutition center (a collection
of neurons that controls swallowing) in the medulla oblongata. Impulses are then sent back to the uvula and soft palate,
causing them to move upward and close off the nasopharynx.
