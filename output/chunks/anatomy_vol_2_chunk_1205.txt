These conditions in turn stimulate the release of NO, a powerful vasodilator, from endothelial cells (see

Figure 20.17).

 * Contraction of the precapillary sphincter is triggered by the opposite levels of the regulators, which prompt the
release of endothelins, powerful vasoconstricting peptides secreted by endothelial cells. Platelet secretions and certain
prostaglandins may also trigger constriction.

 Again, these factors alter tissue perfusion via their effects on the precapillary sphincter mechanism, which regulates
blood flow to capillaries. Since the amount of blood is limited, not all capillaries can fill at once, so blood flow is allocated
based upon the needs and metabolic state of the tissues as reflected in these parameters. Bear in mind, however, that dilation
and constriction of the arterioles feeding the capillary beds is the primary control mechanism.

 The Myogenic Response

The myogenic response is a reaction to the stretching of the smooth muscle in the walls of arterioles as changes in blood
flow occur through the vessel.
