At some point, they begin to grow toward the surface and become an uneven patch, bump, growth,
or scar on the skin surface (Figure 5.18). Like most cancers, basal cell carcinomas respond best to treatment when caught
early. Treatment options include surgery, freezing (cryosurgery), and topical ointments (Mayo Clinic 2012).

skin cancer, it is readily cured if caught early and treated. (credit: John Hendrix, MD)

Squamous Cell Carcinoma

Squamous cell carcinoma is a cancer that affects the keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum and presents as lesions
commonly found on the scalp, ears, and hands (Figure 5.19). It is the second most common skin cancer. The American
Cancer Society reports that two of 10 skin cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, and it is more aggressive than basal
cell carcinoma.
