These reflexes disappear as
the baby grows, as some of them may be unnecessary as they age. The video demonstrates a reflex called the Babinski
reflex, in which the foot flexes dorsally and the toes splay out when the sole of the foot is lightly scratched. This is
normal for newborns, but it is a sign of reduced myelination of the spinal tract in adults. Why would this reflex be a
problem for an adult?
