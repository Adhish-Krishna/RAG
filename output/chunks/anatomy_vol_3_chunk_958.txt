(vertebrochondral) ribs, 8-12, are attached either indirectly or not at all to the sternum. Ribs 8-10 are attached indirectly to the
sternum. For these ribs, the costal cartilage of each attaches to the cartilage of the next higher rib. The last false ribs (11-12) ai
Iso called floating (vertebral) ribs, because these ribs do not attach to the sternum at all. Instead, the ribs and their small costal
â€˜artilages terminate within the muscles of the lateral abdominal wall. 42 The brain-case bones that form the top and sides of the
ull are produced by intramembranous ossification. In this, mesenchyme from the sclerotome portion of the somites accumulates
it the site of the future bone and differentiates into bone-producing cells. These generate areas of bone that are initially separated by
wide regions of fibrous connective tissue called fontanelles. After birth, as the bones enlarge, the fontanelles disappear.
