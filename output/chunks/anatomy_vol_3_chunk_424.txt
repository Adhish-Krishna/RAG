24.3 Lipid Metabolism

Lipids are available to the body from three sources. They can be ingested in the diet, stored in the adipose tissue of the
body, or synthesized in the liver. Fats ingested in the diet are digested in the small intestine. The triglycerides are broken
down into monoglycerides and free fatty acids, then imported across the intestinal mucosa. Once across, the triglycerides are
resynthesized and transported to the liver or adipose tissue. Fatty acids are oxidized through fatty acid or B-oxidation into
two-carbon acetyl CoA molecules, which can then enter the Krebs cycle to generate ATP. If excess acetyl CoA is created
and overloads the capacity of the Krebs cycle, the acetyl CoA can be used to synthesize ketone bodies. When glucose is
limited, ketone bodies can be oxidized and used for fuel. Excess acetyl CoA generated from excess glucose or carbohydrate
ingestion can be used for fatty acid synthesis or lipogenesis.
