The alveolar wall consists of three major cell types: type I alveolar cells, type II alveolar cells, and alveolar
macrophages. A type I alveolar cell is a squamous epithelial cell of the alveoli, which constitute up to 97 percent of
the alveolar surface area. These cells are about 25 nm thick and are highly permeable to gases. A type II alveolar cell
is interspersed among the type I cells and secretes pulmonary surfactant, a substance composed of phospholipids and
proteins that reduces the surface tension of the alveoli.
