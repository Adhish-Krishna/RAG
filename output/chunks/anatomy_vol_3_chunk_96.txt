Erythrocytes contain a metalloprotein, hemoglobin, which serves to bind oxygen
molecules to the erythrocyte (Figure 22.25). Heme is the portion of hemoglobin that contains iron, and it is heme that binds
oxygen. One erythrocyte contains four iron ions, and because of this, each erythrocyte is capable of carrying up to four
molecules of oxygen. As oxygen diffuses across the respiratory membrane from the alveolus to the capillary, it also diffuses
into the red blood cell and is bound by hemoglobin. The following reversible chemical reaction describes the production
of the final product, oxyhemoglobin (Hb—O2), which is formed when oxygen binds to hemoglobin. Oxyhemoglobin is a
bright red-colored molecule that contributes to the bright red color of oxygenated blood.
 Hb + O, = Hb — O,

In this formula, Hb represents reduced hemoglobin, that is, hemoglobin that does not have oxygen bound to it.
