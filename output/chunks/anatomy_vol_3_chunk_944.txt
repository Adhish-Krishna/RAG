the body. The rigid, yet flexible skeleton acts as a framework to support the other organs of the body. It facilitates movement. The
movable joints allow the skeleton to change shape and positions; that is, move. It protects internal organs. Parts of the skeleton
enclose or partly enclose various organs of the body including our brain, ears, heart, and lungs. Any trauma to these organs has
to be mediated through the skeletal system. It produces blood cells. The central cavity of long bones is filled with marrow. The
red marrow is responsible for forming red and white blood cells. It stores and releases minerals and fat. The mineral component
of bone, in addition to providing hardness to bone, provides a mineral reservoir that can be tapped as needed.
