At the time of birth, the mandible consists

paired right and left bones, but these fuse together during the first year to form the single U-shaped mandible of the adult

skull. Each side of the mandible consists of a horizontal body and posteriorly, a vertically oriented ramus of the mandible

(ramus = “branch”). The outside margin of the mandible, where the body and ramus come together is called the angle of

the mandible (Figure 7.15).

 The ramus on each side of the mandible has two upward-going bony projections. The more anterior projection is
the flattened coronoid process of the mandible, which provides attachment for one of the biting muscles. The posterior
projection is the condylar process of the mandible, which is topped by the oval-shaped condyle. The condyle of
the mandible articulates (joins) with the mandibular fossa and articular tubercle of the temporal bone.
