As the femoral artery passes posterior to the knee near the popliteal fossa,
it is called the popliteal artery. The popliteal artery branches into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries.

 The anterior tibial artery is located between the tibia and fibula, and supplies blood to the muscles and integument of
the anterior tibial region. Upon reaching the tarsal region, it becomes the dorsalis pedis artery, which branches repeatedly
and provides blood to the tarsal and dorsal regions of the foot. The posterior tibial artery provides blood to the muscles
and integument on the posterior surface of the tibial region. The fibular or peroneal artery branches from the posterior tibial
artery. It bifurcates and becomes the medial plantar artery and lateral plantar artery, providing blood to the plantar
surfaces. There is an anastomosis with the dorsalis pedis artery, and the medial and lateral plantar arteries form two arches
called the dorsal arch (also called the arcuate arch) and the plantar arch, which provide blood to the remainder of the foot
and toes.
