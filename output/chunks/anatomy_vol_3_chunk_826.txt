At what point in fetal development
can a regular heartbeat be detected?

 The fetus continues to lay down subcutaneous fat from week 31 until birth. The added fat fills out the hypodermis,
and the skin transitions from red and wrinkled to soft and pink. Lanugo is shed, and the nails grow to the tips of the fingers
and toes. Immediately before birth, the average crown-to-rump length is 35.5-40.5 cm (14—16 in), and the fetus weighs
approximately 2.5—4 kg (5.5-8.8 lbs). Once born, the newborn is no longer confined to the fetal position, so subsequent
measurements are made from head-to-toe instead of from crown-to-rump. At birth, the average length is approximately 51
cm (20 in).
