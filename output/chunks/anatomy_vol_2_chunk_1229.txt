The aortic arch descends toward the inferior portions of
the body and ends at the level of the intervertebral disk between the fourth and fifth thoracic vertebrae. Beyond this point,
the descending aorta continues close to the bodies of the vertebrae and passes through an opening in the diaphragm known
as the aortic hiatus. Superior to the diaphragm, the aorta is called the thoracic aorta, and inferior to the diaphragm, it is
called the abdominal aorta. The abdominal aorta terminates when it bifurcates into the two common iliac arteries at the

level of the fourth lumbar vertebra. See Figure 20.25 for an illustration of the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and the initial
segment of the descending aorta plus major branches; Table 20.5 summarizes the structures of the aorta.
