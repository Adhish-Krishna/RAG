Once inside, the muscular contractions and beating cilia move the oocyte slowly toward the uterus.
 When fertilization does occur, sperm typically meet the egg while it is still moving through the ampulla.

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ovulation) to observe ovulation and its initiation in response to the
release of FSH and LH from the pituitary gland. What specialized structures help guide the oocyte from the ovary into
the uterine tube?

 If the oocyte is successfully fertilized, the resulting zygote will begin to divide into two cells, then four, and so on, as
it makes its way through the uterine tube and into the uterus. There, it will implant and continue to grow. If the egg is not
fertilized, it will simply degrade—either in the uterine tube or in the uterus, where it may be shed with the next menstrual
period.
