If untreated, the condition can result in congestive heart failure.

 Septal defects are not uncommon in individuals and may be congenital or caused by various disease processes.
 Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital condition that may also occur from exposure to unknown environmental factors; it
occurs when there is an opening in the interventricular septum caused by blockage of the pulmonary trunk, normally
at the pulmonary semilunar valve. This allows blood that is relatively low in oxygen from the right ventricle to flow
into the left ventricle and mix with the blood that is relatively high in oxygen. Symptoms include a distinct heart
murmur, low blood oxygen percent saturation, dyspnea or difficulty in breathing, polycythemia, broadening (clubbing)
of the fingers and toes, and in children, difficulty in feeding or failure to grow and develop.
