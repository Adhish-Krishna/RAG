This procedure not
only allows for listening to airflow, but it may also amplify heart murmurs. Inhalation increases blood flow into the right
side of the heart and may increase the amplitude of right-sided heart murmurs. Expiration partially restricts blood flow into
the left side of the heart and may amplify left-sided heart murmurs. Figure 19.30 indicates proper placement of the bell of
the stethoscope to facilitate auscultation.

Figure 19.30 Stethoscope Placement for Auscultation Proper placement of the bell of the stethoscope facilitates
auscultation. At each of the four locations on the chest, a different valve can be heard.
