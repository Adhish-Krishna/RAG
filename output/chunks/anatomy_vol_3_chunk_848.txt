Upon birth of the newborn’s head, an obstetrician will aspirate mucus from the mouth and nose before the newborn’s
first breath. Once the head is birthed, the rest of the body usually follows quickly. The umbilical cord is then double-
clamped, and a cut is made between the clamps. This completes the second stage of childbirth.

 Afterbirth

The delivery of the placenta and associated membranes, commonly referred to as the afterbirth, marks the final stage
of childbirth. After expulsion of the newborn, the myometrium continues to contract. This movement shears the placenta
from the back of the uterine wall. It is then easily delivered through the vagina. Continued uterine contractions then reduce
blood loss from the site of the placenta. Delivery of the placenta marks the beginning of the postpartum period—the period
of approximately 6 weeks immediately following childbirth during which the mother’s body gradually returns to a non-
pregnant state.
