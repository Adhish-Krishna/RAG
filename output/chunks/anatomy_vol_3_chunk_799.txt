Embryonic Membranes

During the second week of development, with the embryo implanted in the uterus, cells within the blastocyst start to
organize into layers. Some grow to form the extra-embryonic membranes needed to support and protect the growing
embryo: the amnion, the yolk sac, the allantois, and the chorion.

 At the beginning of the second week, the cells of the inner cell mass form into a two-layered disc of embryonic cells,
and a space—the amniotic cavity—opens up between it and the trophoblast (Figure 28.8). Cells from the upper layer of the
disc (the epiblast) extend around the amniotic cavity, creating a membranous sac that forms into the amnion by the end of
the second week. The amnion fills with amniotic fluid and eventually grows to surround the embryo. Early in development,
amniotic fluid consists almost entirely of a filtrate of maternal plasma, but as the kidneys of the fetus begin to function
at approximately the eighth week, they add urine to the volume of amniotic fluid.
