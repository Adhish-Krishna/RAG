Lipogenesis

When glucose levels are plentiful, the excess acetyl CoA generated by glycolysis can be converted into fatty acids,
triglycerides, cholesterol, steroids, and bile salts. This process, called lipogenesis, creates lipids (fat) from the acetyl CoA
and takes place in the cytoplasm of adipocytes (fat cells) and hepatocytes (liver cells). When you eat more glucose or
carbohydrates than your body needs, your system uses acetyl CoA to turn the excess into fat. Although there are several
metabolic sources of acetyl CoA, it is most commonly derived from glycolysis. Acetyl CoA availability is significant,
because it initiates lipogenesis. Lipogenesis begins with acetyl CoA and advances by the subsequent addition of two carbon
atoms from another acetyl CoA; this process is repeated until fatty acids are the appropriate length. Because this is a bond-
creating anabolic process, ATP is consumed. However, the creation of triglycerides and lipids is an efficient way of storing
the energy available in carbohydrates.
