The sodium/potassium pump requires energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), so it is also referred to as

an ATPase. As was explained in the cell chapter, the concentration of Na‚Äù is higher outside the cel

than inside, and the

concentration of K* is higher inside the cell is higher than outside. That means that this pump is moving the ions against the

concentration gradients for sodium and potassium, which is why it requires energy. In fact, the pum
those concentration gradients.
 Ion channels are pores that allow specific charged particles to cross the membrane in res

p basically maintains

ponse to an existing

concentration gradient. Proteins are capable of spanning the cell membrane, including its hydrophobic core, and can

interact with the charge of ions because of the varied properties of amino acids found within specifi
of the protein channel.
