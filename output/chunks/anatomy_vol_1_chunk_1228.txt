Other muscle names can indicate
the location in the body or bones with which the muscle is associated, such as the tibialis anterior. The shapes of some
muscles are distinctive; for example, the direction of the muscle fibers is used to describe muscles of the body midline. The
origin and/or insertion can also be features used to name a muscle; examples are the biceps brachii, triceps brachii, and the
pectoralis major.

11.3 Axial Muscles of the Head, Neck, and Back

Muscles are either axial muscles or appendicular. The axial muscles are grouped based on location, function, or both.
 Some axial muscles cross over to the appendicular skeleton. The muscles of the head and neck are all axial. The muscles
in the face create facial expression by inserting into the skin rather than onto bone. Muscles that move the eyeballs are
extrinsic, meaning they originate outside of the eye and insert onto it.
