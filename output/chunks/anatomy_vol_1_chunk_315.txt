The
strands are bonded together via their nitrogenous base pairs using hydrogen bonds.

 DNA replication is the copying of DNA that occurs before cell division can take place. After a great deal of debate
and experimentation, the general method of DNA replication was deduced in 1958 by two scientists in California, Matthew
Meselson and Franklin Stahl. This method is illustrated in Figure 3.24 and described below.

Figure 3.24 DNA Replication DNA replication faithfully duplicates the entire genome of the cell. During DNA
replication, a number of different enzymes work together to pull apart the two strands so each strand can be used as
a template to synthesize new complementary strands.
