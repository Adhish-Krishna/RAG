In the earliest vertebrate species, the
cerebrum was not much more than olfactory bulbs that received peripheral information about the chemical environment (to
call it smell in these organisms is imprecise because they lived in the ocean).

 The diencephalon is deep beneath the cerebrum and constitutes the walls of the third ventricle. The diencephalon can
be described as any region of the brain with “thalamus” in its name. The two major regions of the diencephalon are the
thalamus itself and the hypothalamus (Figure 13.11). There are other structures, such as the epithalamus, which contains
the pineal gland, or the subthalamus, which includes the subthalamic nucleus that is part of the basal nuclei.

 Thalamus

The thalamus is a collection of nuclei that relay information between the cerebral cortex and the periphery, spinal cord, or
brain stem. All sensory information, except for the sense of smell, passes through the thalamus before processing by the
cortex.
