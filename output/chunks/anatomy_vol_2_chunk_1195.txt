Baroreceptor Reflexes

Baroreceptors are specialized stretch receptors located within thin areas of blood vessels and heart chambers that respond
to the degree of stretch caused by the presence of blood. They send impulses to the cardiovascular center to regulate blood
pressure. Vascular baroreceptors are found primarily in sinuses (small cavities) within the aorta and carotid arteries: The
aortic sinuses are found in the walls of the ascending aorta just superior to the aortic valve, whereas the carotid sinuses are
in the base of the internal carotid arteries. There are also low-pressure baroreceptors located in the walls of the venae cavae
and right atrium.

 When blood pressure increases, the baroreceptors are stretched more tightly and initiate action potentials at a higher
rate. At lower blood pressures, the degree of stretch is lower and the rate of firing is slower. When the cardiovascular center
in the medulla oblongata receives this input, it triggers a reflex that maintains homeostasis (Figure 20.18):
