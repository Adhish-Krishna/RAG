At most of the other targets of the autonomic system, the effector response is based on which neurotransmitter
is released and what receptor is present. For example, regions of the heart that establish heart rate are contacted by
postganglionic fibers from both systems. If norepinephrine is released onto those cells, it binds to an adrenergic receptor that
causes the cells to depolarize faster, and the heart rate increases. If ACh is released onto those cells, it binds to a muscarinic
receptor that causes the cells to hyperpolarize so that they cannot reach threshold as easily, and the heart rate slows. Without
this parasympathetic input, the heart would work at a rate of approximately 100 beats per minute (bpm). The sympathetic
system speeds that up, as it would during exercise, to 120-140 bpm, for example. The parasympathetic system slows it
down to the resting heart rate of 60-80 bpm.

 Another example is in the control of pupillary size (Figure 15.9).
