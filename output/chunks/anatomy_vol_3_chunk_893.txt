A classic example o:
codominance in humans is ABO blood type. People are blood type A if they have an allele for an enzyme that facilitates

the production of surface antigen A on their erythrocytes. This allele is designated In the same manner, people are blood
type B if they express an enzyme for the production of surface antigen B. People who have alleles for both enzymes (A
and 1°) produce both surface antigens A and B. As a result, they are blood type AB. Because the effect of both alleles (or

enzymes) is observed, we say that the F and I? alleles are codominant. There is also a third allele that determines blood
type. This allele (i) produces a nonfunctional enzyme. People who have two i alleles do not produce either A or B surface

antigens: they have type O blood. If a person has F andi alleles, the person will have blood type A. Notice that it does not
make any difference whether a person has two F alleles or one F’ and one i allele.
