As with
acidosis, respiratory disorders are a major cause; however, in respiratory alkalosis, carbon dioxide levels fall too low.
 Lung disease, aspirin overdose, shock, and ordinary anxiety can cause respiratory alkalosis, which reduces the normal
concentration of H*.

 Metabolic alkalosis often results from prolonged, severe vomiting, which causes a loss of hydrogen and chloride
ions (as components of HCl). Medications also can prompt alkalosis. These include diuretics that cause the body to
lose potassium ions, as well as antacids when taken in excessive amounts, for instance by someone with persistent
heartburn or an ulcer.
