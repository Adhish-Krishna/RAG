Normally this
value is extremely difficult to measure, but it can be calculated from this known relationship:

=—_ AP
Blood flow = Resistance
If we rearrange this slightly,
 A = AP
Resistance = Blood flow
Then by substituting Pouseille’s equation for blood flow:
Resistance 8.

By examining this equation, you can see that there are only three variables: viscosity, vessel length, and radius, since
8 and nm are both constants. The important thing to remember is this: Two of these variables, viscosity and vessel length,
will change slowly in the body. Only one of these factors, the radius, can be changed rapidly by vasoconstriction and
vasodilation, thus dramatically impacting resistance and flow. Further, small changes in the radius will greatly affect flow,
since it is raised to the fourth power in the equation.

 We have briefly considered how cardiac output and blood volume impact blood flow and pressure; the next step is to
see how the other variables (contraction, vessel length, and viscosity) articulate with Pouseille’s equation and what they can
teach us about the impact on blood flow.
