GnRH activates the anterior pituitary to produce LH and FSH, which stimulate the production of estrogen
and progesterone by the ovaries.

 When only the one dominant follicle remains in the ovary, it again begins to secrete estrogen. It produces more estrogen
than all of the developing follicles did together before the negative feedback occurred. It produces so much estrogen that the
normal negative feedback doesnâ€™t occur. Instead, these extremely high concentrations of systemic plasma estrogen trigger
a regulatory switch in the anterior pituitary that responds by secreting large amounts of LH and FSH into the bloodstream
(see Figure 27.13). The positive feedback loop by which more estrogen triggers release of more LH and FSH only occurs
at this point in the cycle.

 It is this large burst of LH (called the LH surge) that leads to ovulation of the dominant follicle. The LH surge induces
many changes in the dominant follicle, including stimulating the resumption of meiosis of the primary oocyte to a secondary
oocyte.
