A slight overshoot of hyperpolarization marks the end of the action potential. While an action potential

is in progress, another cannot be generated under the same conditions. While the voltage-gated Na* channel is inactivated,
absolutely no action potentials can be generated. Once that channel has returned to its resting state, a new action potential

is possible, but it must be started by a relatively stronger stimulus to overcome the K* leaving the cell.

 The action potential travels down the axon as voltage-gated ion channels are opened by the spreading depolarization.
 In unmyelinated axons, this happens in a continuous fashion because there are voltage-gated channels throughout the
membrane. In myelinated axons, propagation is described as saltatory because voltage-gated channels are only found at the
nodes of Ranvier and the electrical events seem to “jump” from one node to the next.
