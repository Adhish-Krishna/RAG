Severe or limited memory loss can be the result of a temporal lobe
stroke.

 Related to strokes are transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), which can also be called “mini-strokes.” These are events
in which a physical blockage may be temporary, cutting off the blood supply and oxygen to a region, but not to the
extent that it causes cell death in that region. While the neurons in that area are recovering from the event, neurological
function may be lost. Function can return if the area is able to recover from the event.

 Recovery from a stroke (or TIA) is strongly dependent on the speed of treatment. Often, the person who is present
and notices something is wrong must then make a decision. The mnemonic FAST helps people remember what to look
for when someone is dealing with sudden losses of neurological function. If someone complains of feeling “funny,”
check these things quickly: Look at the person’s face.
