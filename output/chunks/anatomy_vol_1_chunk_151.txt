(b) The opposite electrical charges of the resulting sodium cation and
chloride anion result in the formation of a bond of attraction called an ionic bond. (c) The attraction of many sodium
and chloride ions results in the formation of large groupings called crystals.

CHAPTER 2 | THE CHEMICAL LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION 55

Water is an essential component of life because it is able to break the ionic bonds in salts to free the ions. In fact, in
biological fluids, most individual atoms exist as ions. These dissolved ions produce electrical charges within the body. The
behavior of these ions produces the tracings of heart and brain function observed as waves on an electrocardiogram (EKG
or ECG) or an electroencephalogram (EEG). The electrical activity that derives from the interactions of the charged ions is
why they are also called electrolytes.

 Covalent Bonds

Unlike ionic bonds formed by the attraction between a cation’s positive charge and an anion’s negative charge, molecules
formed by a covalent bond share electrons in a mutually stabilizing relationship.
