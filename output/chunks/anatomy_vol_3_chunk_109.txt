Carbon dioxide diffuses out of the erythrocytes and into the plasma, where it can further
diffuse across the respiratory membrane into the alveoli to be exhaled during pulmonary ventilation.

 Carbaminohemoglobin

About 20 percent of carbon dioxide is bound by hemoglobin and is transported to the lungs. Carbon dioxide does not bind
to iron as oxygen does; instead, carbon dioxide binds amino acid moieties on the globin portions of hemoglobin to form
carbaminohemoglobin, which forms when hemoglobin and carbon dioxide bind. When hemoglobin is not transporting
oxygen, it tends to have a bluish-purple tone to it, creating the darker maroon color typical of deoxygenated blood. The
following formula depicts this reversible reaction:
CO, + Hb @ HbCO,

Similar to the transport of oxygen by heme, the binding and dissociation of carbon dioxide to and from hemoglobin is
dependent on the partial pressure of carbon dioxide.
