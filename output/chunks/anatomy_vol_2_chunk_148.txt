Many axons are insulated by a lipid-rich substance called myelin. Specific types of glial cells
provide this insulation.

 Several types of glial cells are found in the nervous system, and they can be categorized by the anatomical division
in which they are found. In the CNS, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and ependymal cells are found. Astrocytes
are important for maintaining the chemical environment around the neuron and are crucial for regulating the blood-brain
barrier. Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating glia in the CNS. Microglia act as phagocytes and play a role in immune
surveillance. Ependymal cells are responsible for filtering the blood to produce cerebrospinal fluid, which is a circulatory
fluid that performs some of the functions of blood in the brain and spinal cord because of the BBB. In the PNS, satellite
cells are supporting cells for the neurons, and Schwann cells insulate peripheral axons.

 12.3 The Function of Nervous Tissue

Sensation starts with the activation of a sensory ending, such as the thermoreceptor in the skin sensing the temperature of
the water.
