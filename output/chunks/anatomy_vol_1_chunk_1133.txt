It is so-named because the Greek letter delta looks like a triangle. The rectus abdomis
(rector = “straight”) is the straight muscle in the anterior wall of the abdomen, while the rectus femoris is the straight muscle
in the anterior compartment of the thigh.

 When a muscle has a widespread expansion over a sizable area, but then the fascicles come to a single, common
attachment point, the muscle is called convergent. The attachment point for a convergent muscle could be a tendon, an
aponeurosis (a flat, broad tendon), or a raphe (a very slender tendon). The large muscle on the chest, the pectoralis major, is
an example of a convergent muscle because it converges on the greater tubercle of the humerus via a tendon. The temporalis
muscle of the cranium is another.

 Pennate muscles (penna = “feathers”) blend into a tendon that runs through the central region of the muscle for its
whole length, somewhat like the quill of a feather with the muscle arranged similar to the feathers.
