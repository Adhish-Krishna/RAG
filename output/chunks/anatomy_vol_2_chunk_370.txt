The trigeminal pathway carries somatosensory information from the face, head, mouth, and nasal cavity. As with the
previously discussed nerve tracts, the sensory pathways of the trigeminal pathway each involve three successive neurons.
 First, axons from the trigeminal ganglion enter the brain stem at the level of the pons. These axons project to one of
three locations. The spinal trigeminal nucleus of the medulla receives information similar to that carried by spinothalamic
tract, such as pain and temperature sensations. Other axons go to either the chief sensory nucleus in the pons or the
mesencephalic nuclei in the midbrain. These nuclei receive information like that carried by the dorsal column system, such
as touch, pressure, vibration, and proprioception. Axons from the second neuron decussate and ascend to the thalamus along
the trigeminothalamic tract. In the thalamus, each axon synapses with the third neuron in its respective pathway. Axons
from the third neuron then project from the thalamus to the primary somatosensory cortex of the cerebrum.
