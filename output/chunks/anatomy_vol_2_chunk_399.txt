Whereas the sensory cortical areas are located in the occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes, motor functions are
largely controlled by the frontal lobe. The most anterior regions of the frontal lobe—the prefrontal areas—are important
for executive functions, which are those cognitive functions that lead to goal-directed behaviors. These higher cognitive
processes include working memory, which has been called a “mental scratch pad,” that can help organize and represent
information that is not in the immediate environment. The prefrontal lobe is responsible for aspects of attention, such as
inhibiting distracting thoughts and actions so that a person can focus on a goal and direct behavior toward achieving that
goal.

 The functions of the prefrontal cortex are integral to the personality of an individual, because it is largely responsible
for what a person intends to do and how they accomplish those plans.
