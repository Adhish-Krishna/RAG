Most of the ions and molecules in the filtrate are needed by the body and must be reabsorbed farther down the nephron
tubules, resulting in the formation of urine. Urine characteristics change depending on water intake, exercise, environmental
temperature, and nutrient intake. Urinalysis analyzes characteristics of the urine and is used to diagnose diseases. A
minimum of 400 to 500 mL urine must be produced daily to rid the body of wastes. Excessive quantities of urine may
indicate diabetes insipidus or diabetes mellitus. The pH range of urine is 4.5 to 8.0, and is affected by diet. Osmolarity
ranges from 50 to 1200 milliosmoles, and is a reflection of the amount of water being recovered or lost by renal nephrons.
