A uniaxial joint only allows for a motion in a single plane (around a single axis). The elbow joint, which only allows
for bending or straightening, is an example of a uniaxial joint. A biaxial joint allows for motions within two planes. An
example of a biaxial joint is a metacarpophalangeal joint (knuckle joint) of the hand. The joint allows for movement along
one axis to produce bending or straightening of the finger, and movement along a second axis, which allows for spreading
of the fingers away from each other and bringing them together. A joint that allows for the several directions of movement
is called a multiaxial joint (polyaxial or triaxial joint). This type of diarthrotic joint allows for movement along three axes
(Figure 9.4). The shoulder and hip joints are multiaxial joints. They allow the upper or lower limb to move in an anterior-
posterior direction and a medial-lateral direction.
