It can be represented mathematically by the following equation:

CO =HR*x SV

SV is normally measured using an echocardiogram to record EDV and ESV, and calculating the difference: SV = EDV
â€” ESV. SV can also be measured using a specialized catheter, but this is an invasive procedure and far more dangerous
to the patient. A mean SV for a resting 70-kg (150-lb) individual would be approximately 70 mL. There are several
important variables, including size of the heart, physical and mental condition of the individual, sex, contractility, duration
of contraction, preload or EDV, and afterload or resistance. Normal range for SV would be 55-100 mL. An average resting
HR would be approximately 75 bpm but could range from 60-100 in some individuals.

CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 817

Using these numbers, the mean CO is 5.25 L/min, with a range of 4.0-8.0 L/min. Remember, however, that these
numbers refer to CO from each ventricle separately, not the total for the heart.
