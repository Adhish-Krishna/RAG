This backflow causes the cusps of the tricuspid and mitral (bicuspid) valves to close.
 These valves are tied down to the papillary muscles by chordae tendineae. During the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle,
the papillary muscles are also relaxed and the tension on the chordae tendineae is slight (see Figure 19.13b). However, as
the myocardium of the ventricle contracts, so do the papillary muscles. This creates tension on the chordae tendineae (see
Figure 19.14b), helping to hold the cusps of the atrioventricular valves in place and preventing them from being blown
back into the atria.

 The aortic and pulmonary semilunar valves lack the chordae tendineae and papillary muscles associated with the
atrioventricular valves. Instead, they consist of pocket-like folds of endocardium reinforced with additional connective
tissue. When the ventricles relax and the change in pressure forces the blood toward the ventricles, the blood presses against
these cusps and seals the openings.
