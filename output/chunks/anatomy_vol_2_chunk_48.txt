There are actually more senses than just those, but that list represents the major senses. Those five are all senses
that receive stimuli from the outside world, and of which there is conscious perception. Additional sensory stimuli might be
from the internal environment (inside the body), such as the stretch of an organ wall or the concentration of certain ions in
the blood.

 Response. The nervous system produces a response on the basis of the stimuli perceived by sensory structures. An
obvious response would be the movement of muscles, such as withdrawing a hand from a hot stove, but there are broader
uses of the term. The nervous system can cause the contraction of all three types of muscle tissue. For example, skeletal
muscle contracts to move the skeleton, cardiac muscle is influenced as heart rate increases during exercise, and smooth
muscle contracts as the digestive system moves food along the digestive tract.
