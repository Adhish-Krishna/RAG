Low blood calcium levels cause the production
and secretion of PTH. In contrast, elevated blood calcium levels inhibit secretion of PTH and trigger secretion of the thyroid
hormone calcitonin. Underproduction of PTH can result in hypoparathyroidism. In contrast, overproduction of PTH can
result in hyperparathyroidism.

 17.6 The Adrenal Glands

The adrenal glands, located superior to each kidney, consist of two regions: the adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla. The
adrenal cortex—the outer layer of the gland—produces mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. The adrenal
medulla at the core of the gland produces epinephrine and norepinephrine.

 The adrenal glands mediate a short-term stress response and a long-term stress response. A perceived threat results in
the secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla, which mediate the fight-or-flight response. The
long-term stress response is mediated by the secretion of CRH from the hypothalamus, which triggers ACTH, which in
turn stimulates the secretion of corticosteroids from the adrenal cortex.
