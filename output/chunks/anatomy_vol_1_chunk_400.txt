 Stratified Epithelium

A stratified epithelium consists of several stacked layers of cells. This epithelium protects against physical and chemical
wear and tear. The stratified epithelium is named by the shape of the most apical layer of cells, closest to the free space.
 Stratified squamous epithelium is the most common type of stratified epithelium in the human body. The apical cells are
squamous, whereas the basal layer contains either columnar or cuboidal cells. The top layer may be covered with dead cells
filled with keratin. Mammalian skin is an example of this dry, keratinized, stratified squamous epithelium. The lining of
the mouth cavity is an example of an unkeratinized, stratified squamous epithelium.
