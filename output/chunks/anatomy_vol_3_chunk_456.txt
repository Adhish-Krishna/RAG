Paired Cowperâ€™s glands (bulbourethral glands) produce and secrete mucus into the urethra to buffer urethral pH
during sexual stimulation. The mucus neutralizes the usually acidic environment and lubricates the urethra, decreasing the
resistance to ejaculation. The membranous urethra passes through the deep muscles of the perineum, where it is invested
by the overlying urethral sphincters. The spongy urethra exits at the tip (external urethral orifice) of the penis after passing
through the corpus spongiosum. Mucous glands are found along much of the length of the urethra and protect the urethra
from extremes of urine pH. Innervation is the same in both males and females.

 Bladder

The urinary bladder collects urine from both ureters (Figure 25.4). The bladder lies anterior to the uterus in females,
posterior to the pubic bone and anterior to the rectum. During late pregnancy, its capacity is reduced due to compression
by the enlarging uterus, resulting in increased frequency of urination.
