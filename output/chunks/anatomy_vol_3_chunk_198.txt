These two nuclei then
send back parasympathetic impulses through fibers in the glossopharyngeal and facial nerves, which stimulate salivation.
 Even after you swallow food, salivation is increased to cleanse the mouth and to water down and neutralize any irritating
chemical remnants, such as that hot sauce in your burrito. Most saliva is swallowed along with food and is reabsorbed, so
that fluid is not lost.

The Teeth

The teeth, or dentes (singular = dens), are organs similar to bones that you use to tear, grind, and otherwise mechanically
break down food.

 Types of Teeth

During the course of your lifetime, you have two sets of teeth (one set of teeth is a dentition). Your 20 deciduous teeth, or
baby teeth, first begin to appear at about 6 months of age.
