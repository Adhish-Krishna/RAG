Recent research is shedding light on the more
the brain and nervous system. Astrocyte cells, named for their distinctive

star shape, are abundant in the central nervous system. The astrocytes have many functions, including regulation of ion
concentration in the intercellular space, uptake and/or breakdown of some neurotransmitters, and formation of the blood-

brain barrier, the membrane that separates tl
against infection but are not nervous tissue be:

he circulatory system from the brain. Microglia protect the nervous system
cause they are related to macrophages. Oligodendrocyte cells produce myelin

in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) while the Schwann cell produces myelin in the peripheral nervous

system (Figure 4.20).
