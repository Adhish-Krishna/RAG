¢ Describe the three basic types of chemical reactions
¢ Identify several factors influencing the rate of chemical reactions

One characteristic of a living organism is metabolism, which is the sum total of all of the chemical reactions that go
on to maintain that organism’s health and life. The bonding processes you have learned thus far are anabolic chemical
reactions; that is, they form larger molecules from smaller molecules or atoms. But recall that metabolism can proceed in
another direction: in catabolic chemical reactions, bonds between components of larger molecules break, releasing smaller
molecules or atoms. Both types of reaction involve exchanges not only of matter, but of energy.

 The Role of Energy in Chemical Reactions

Chemical reactions require a sufficient amount of energy to cause the matter to collide with enough precision and force
that old chemical bonds can be broken and new ones formed.
