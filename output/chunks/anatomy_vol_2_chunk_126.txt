Graded potentials summate at a specific
location at the beginning of the axon to initiate the action potential, namely the initial segment. For sensory neurons, which
do not have a cell body between the dendrites and the axon, the initial segment is directly adjacent to the dendritic endings.
 For all other neurons, the axon hillock is essentially the initial segment of the axon, and it is where summation takes place.

 These locations have a high density of voltage-gated Na* channels that initiate the depolarizing phase of the action potential.

 Summation can be spatial or temporal, meaning it can be the result of multiple graded potentials at different locations
on the neuron, or all at the same place but separated in time. Spatial summation is related to associating the activity of
multiple inputs to a neuron with each other. Temporal summation is the relationship of multiple action potentials from a
single cell resulting in a significant change in the membrane potential.
