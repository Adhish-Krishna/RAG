As the cartilage grows, capillaries penetrate it. This penetration initiates the transformation of the perichondrium into
the bone-producing periosteum. Here, the osteoblasts form a periosteal collar of compact bone around the cartilage of the
diaphysis. By the second or third month of fetal life, bone cell development and ossification ramps up and creates the
primary ossification center, a region deep in the periosteal collar where ossification begins (Figure 6.17c).

 While these deep changes are occurring, chondrocytes and cartilage continue to grow at the ends of the bone (the future
epiphyses), which increases the boneâ€™s length at the same time bone is replacing cartilage in the diaphyses. By the time the
fetal skeleton is fully formed, cartilage only remains at the joint surface as articular cartilage and between the diaphysis and
epiphysis as the epiphyseal plate, the latter of which is responsible for the longitudinal growth of bones.
