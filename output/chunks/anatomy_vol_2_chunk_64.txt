Secondly, the cell bodies
of unipolar neurons are always found in ganglia. Sensory reception is a peripheral function (those dendrites are in the
periphery, perhaps in the skin) so the cell body is in the periphery, though closer to the CNS in a ganglion. The axon projects
from the dendrite endings, past the cell body in a ganglion, and into the central nervous system.

CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE 479

Bipolar cells have two processes, which extend from each end of the cell body, opposite to each other. One is the axon
and one the dendrite. Bipolar cells are not very common. They are found mainly in the olfactory epithelium (where smell
stimuli are sensed), and as part of the retina.

 Multipolar neurons are all of the neurons that are not unipolar or bipolar. They have one axon and two or more
dendrites (usually many more).
