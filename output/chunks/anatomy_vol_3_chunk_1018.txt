This increases the size of the pelvic outlet, the birth canal through
which the fetus passes during vaginal childbirth. 56 The beta cells produce the hormone insulin, which is important in the
regulation of blood glucose levels. All insulin-dependent cells of the body require insulin in order to take up glucose from the
bloodstream. Destruction of the beta cells would result in an inability to produce and secrete insulin, leading to abnormally high
blood glucose levels and the disease called type 1 diabetes mellitus. 57 Excessive blood glucose levels damage the blood vessels
and nerves of the bodyâ€™s extremities, increasing the risk for injury, infection, and tissue death. Loss of sensation to the feet means
that a diabetic patient will not be able to feel foot trauma, such as from ill-fitting shoes. Even minor injuries commonly lead to
infection, which , can progress to tissue death without proper care, requiring amputation.
