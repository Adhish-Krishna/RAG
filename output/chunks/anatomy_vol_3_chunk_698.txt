The Vulva_ The external female genitalia are referred to collectively as the vulva.

 Vagina

The vagina, shown at the bottom of Figure 27.9 and Figure 27.9, is a muscular canal (approximately 10 cm long) that
serves as the entrance to the reproductive tract. It also serves as the exit from the uterus during menses and childbirth. The
outer walls of the anterior and posterior vagina are formed into longitudinal columns, or ridges, and the superior portion
of the vagina—called the fornix—meets the protruding uterine cervix. The walls of the vagina are lined with an outer,
fibrous adventitia; a middle layer of smooth muscle; and an inner mucous membrane with transverse folds called rugae.
 Together, the middle and inner layers allow the expansion of the vagina to accommodate intercourse and childbirth. The
thin, perforated hymen can partially surround the opening to the vaginal orifice. The hymen can be ruptured with strenuous
physical exercise, penile—vaginal intercourse, and childbirth.
