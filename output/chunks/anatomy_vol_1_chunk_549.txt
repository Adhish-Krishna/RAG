CHAPTER 6 | BONE TISSUE AND THE SKELETAL SYSTEM 205

Figure 6.2 Bones Support Movement Bones act as levers when muscles span a joint and contract. (credit: Benjamin
J. DeLong)

 Bones also protect internal organs from injury by covering or surrounding them. For example, your ribs protect your
lungs and heart, the bones of your vertebral column (spine) protect your spinal cord, and the bones of your cranium (skull)
protect your brain (Figure 6.3).

 Figure 6.3 Bones Protect Brain The cranium completely surrounds and protects the brain from non-traumatic injury.

musculoskeletal system. Some orthopedic problems can be treated with medications, exercises, braces, and other
devices, but others may be best treated with surgery (Figure 6.4).
