Articulations of the Vertebral Column

In addition to being held together by the intervertebral discs, adjacent vertebrae also articulate with each other at synovial
joints formed between the superior and inferior articular processes called zygapophysial joints (facet joints) (see Figure
9.3). These are plane joints that provide for only limited motions between the vertebrae. The orientation of the articular
processes at these joints varies in different regions of the vertebral column and serves to determine the types of motions
available in each vertebral region. The cervical and lumbar regions have the greatest ranges of motions.

 In the neck, the articular processes of cervical vertebrae are flattened and generally face upward or downward. This
orientation provides the cervical vertebral column with extensive ranges of motion for flexion, extension, lateral flexion,
and rotation. In the thoracic region, the downward projecting and overlapping spinous processes, along with the attached
thoracic cage, greatly limit flexion, extension, and lateral flexion.
