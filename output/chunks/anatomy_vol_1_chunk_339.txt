These
tiny structures also play a very important role during mitosis. A centrosome is a pair of centrioles together. The cell contains
two centrosomes side-by-side, which begin to move apart during prophase. As the centrosomes migrate to two different
sides of the cell, microtubules begin to extend from each like long fingers from two hands extending toward each other. The
mitotic spindle is the structure composed of the centrosomes and their emerging microtubules.

 Near the end of prophase there is an invasion of the nuclear area by microtubules from the mitotic spindle. The
nuclear membrane has disintegrated, and the microtubules attach themselves to the centromeres that adjoin pairs of sister
chromatids. The kinetochore is a protein structure on the centromere that is the point of attachment between the mitotic
spindle and the sister chromatids. This stage is referred to as late prophase or “prometaphase” to indicate the transition
between prophase and metaphase.
