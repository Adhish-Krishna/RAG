Figure 2.18 Five Important Monosaccharides

Disaccharides

A disaccharide is a pair of monosaccharides. Disaccharides are formed via dehydration synthesis, and the bond linking
them is referred to as a glycosidic bond (glyco- = “sugar”). Three disaccharides (shown in Figure 2.19) are important to
humans. These are sucrose, commonly referred to as table sugar; lactose, or milk sugar; and maltose, or malt sugar. As you
can tell from their common names, you consume these in your diet; however, your body cannot use them directly. Instead,
in the digestive tract, they are split into their component monosaccharides via hydrolysis.
