The mental status exam addresses these cognitive abilities through a series of subtests designed to elicit particular
behaviors ascribed to these functions. The loss of neurological function can illustrate the location of damage to the
cerebrum. Memory functions are attributed to the temporal lobe, particularly the medial temporal lobe structures known as
the hippocampus and amygdala, along with the adjacent cortex. Evidence of the importance of these structures comes from
the side effects of a bilateral temporal lobectomy that were studied in detail in patient HM.

Losses of language and speech functions, known as aphasias, are associated with damage to the important integration
areas in the left hemisphere known as Broca’s or Wernicke’s areas, as well as the connections in the white matter between
them.
