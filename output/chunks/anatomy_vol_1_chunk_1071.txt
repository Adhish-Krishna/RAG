FO fibers are sometimes called intermediate fibers because they possess characteristics that are intermediate between
fast fibers and slow fibers. They produce ATP relatively quickly, more quickly than SO fibers, and thus can produce
relatively high amounts of tension. They are oxidative because they produce ATP aerobically, possess high amounts of
mitochondria, and do not fatigue quickly. However, FO fibers do not possess significant myoglobin, giving them a lighter
color than the red SO fibers. FO fibers are used primarily for movements, such as walking, that require more energy
than postural control but less energy than an explosive movement, such as sprinting. FO fibers are useful for this type of
movement because they produce more tension than SO fibers but they are more fatigue-resistant than FG fibers.

 FG fibers primarily use anaerobic glycolysis as their ATP source. They have a large diameter and possess high amounts
of glycogen, which is used in glycolysis to generate ATP quickly to produce high levels of tension.
