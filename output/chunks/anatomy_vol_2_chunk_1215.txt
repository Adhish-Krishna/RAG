It should not be confused with emotional or psychological shock. Typically, the patient in circulatory shock will
demonstrate an increased heart rate but decreased blood pressure, but there are cases in which blood pressure will remain
normal. Urine output will fall dramatically, and the patient may appear confused or lose consciousness. Urine output less
than 1 mL/kg body weight/hour is cause for concern. Unfortunately, shock is an example of a positive-feedback loop that,
if uncorrected, may lead to the death of the patient.
 There are several recognized forms of shock:

* Hypovolemic shock in adults is typically caused by hemorrhage, although in children it may be caused by fluid
losses related to severe vomiting or diarrhea. Other causes for hypovolemic shock include extensive burns, exposure
to some toxins, and excessive urine loss related to diabetes insipidus or ketoacidosis. Typically, patients present with
a rapid, almost tachycardic heart rate; a weak pulse often described as “thread;” cool, clammy skin, particularly in
the extremities, due to restricted peripheral blood flow; rapid, shallow breathing; hypothermia; thirst; and dry mouth.
