Hypercapnia, or abnormally elevated blood levels of COz, occurs in any situation that impairs respiratory functions,
including pneumonia and congestive heart failure. Reduced breathing (hypoventilation) due to drugs such as morphine,
barbiturates, or ethanol (or even just holding one’s breath) can also result in hypercapnia. Hypocapnia, or abnormally low
blood levels of CO2, occurs with any cause of hyperventilation that drives off the CO2, such as salicylate toxicity, elevated
room temperatures, fever, or hysteria.

 Renal Regulation of Acid-Base Balance

The renal regulation of the body’s acid-base balance addresses the metabolic component of the buffering system. Whereas
the respiratory system (together with breathing centers in the brain) controls the blood levels of carbonic acid by controlling
the exhalation of COg, the renal system controls the blood levels of bicarbonate.
