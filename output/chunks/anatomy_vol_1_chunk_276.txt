The sodium-potassium pump, which is also called N*/K* ATPase, transports sodium out of a cell while moving

potassium into the cell. The Na*/K* pump is an important ion pump found in the membranes of many types of cells. These
pumps are particularly abundant in nerve cells, which are constantly pumping out sodium ions and pulling in potassium ions
to maintain an electrical gradient across their cell membranes. An electrical gradient is a difference in electrical charge
across a space. In the case of nerve cells, for example, the electrical gradient exists between the inside and outside of the
cell, with the inside being negatively-charged (at around -70 mV) relative to the outside. The negative electrical gradient
is maintained because each Na*/K* pump moves three Naâ€™ ions out of the cell and two K* ions into the cell for each ATP
molecule that is used (Figure 3.9).
