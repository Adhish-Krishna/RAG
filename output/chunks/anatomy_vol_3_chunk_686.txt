These physical and emotional conditions can lead to interruptions
in the vasodilation pathway and result in an inability to achieve an erection.

 Recall that the release of NO induces relaxation of the smooth muscles that surround the penile arteries, leading
to the vasodilation necessary to achieve an erection. To reverse the process of vasodilation, an enzyme called
phosphodiesterase (PDE) degrades a key component of the NO signaling pathway called cGMP. There are several
different forms of this enzyme, and PDE type 5 is the type of PDE found in the tissues of the penis. Scientists
discovered that inhibiting PDE5 increases blood flow, and allows vasodilation of the penis to occur.

PDEs and the vasodilation signaling pathway are found in the vasculature in other parts of the body. In the
1990s, clinical trials of a PDES inhibitor called sildenafil were initiated to treat hypertension and angina pectoris
(chest pain caused by poor blood flow through the heart).
