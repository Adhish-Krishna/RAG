Loop of Henle

The descending and ascending portions of the loop of Henle (sometimes referred to as the nephron loop) are, of course, just
continuations of the same tubule. They run adjacent and parallel to each other after having made a hairpin turn at the deepest
point of their descent. The descending loop of Henle consists of an initial short, thick portion and long, thin portion, whereas
the ascending loop consists of an initial short, thin portion followed by a long, thick portion. The descending thick portion
consists of simple cuboidal epithelium similar to that of the PCT. The descending and ascending thin portions consists of
simple squamous epithelium. As you will see later, these are important differences, since different portions of the loop have
different permeabilities for solutes and water. The ascending thick portion consists of simple cuboidal epithelium similar to
the DCT.

 Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT)

The DCT, like the PCT, is very tortuous and formed by simple cuboidal epithelium, but it is shorter than the PCT.
