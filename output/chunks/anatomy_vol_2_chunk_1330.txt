arise by differentiation from hematopoietic stem cells. Platelets are cell fragments involved in the clotting of blood.

 Lymphocytes: B Cells, T Cells, Plasma Cells, and Natural Killer Cells

As stated above, lymphocytes are the primary cells of adaptive immune responses (Table 21.1). The two basic types of
lymphocytes, B cells and T cells, are identical morphologically with a large central nucleus surrounded by a thin layer of
cytoplasm. They are distinguished from each other by their surface protein markers as well as by the molecules they secrete.
 While B cells mature in red bone marrow and T cells mature in the thymus, they both initially develop from bone marrow. T
cells migrate from bone marrow to the thymus gland where they further mature. B cells and T cells are found in many parts
of the body, circulating in the bloodstream and lymph, and residing in secondary lymphoid organs, including the spleen and

lymph nodes, which will be described later in this section.
