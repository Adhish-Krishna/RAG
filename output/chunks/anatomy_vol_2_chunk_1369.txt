Outline the steps of T cell development
¢ Describe the major T cell types and their functions

Innate immune responses (and early induced responses) are in many cases ineffective at completely controlling pathogen
growth. However, they slow pathogen growth and allow time for the adaptive immune response to strengthen and either
control or eliminate the pathogen. The innate immune system also sends signals to the cells of the adaptive immune system,
guiding them in how to attack the pathogen. Thus, these are the two important arms of the immune response.

 The Benefits of the Adaptive Immune Response

The specificity of the adaptive immune response—its ability to specifically recognize and make a response against a
wide variety of pathogens—is its great strength. Antigens, the small chemical groups often associated with pathogens,
are recognized by receptors on the surface of B and T lymphocytes. The adaptive immune response to these antigens is
so versatile that it can respond to nearly any pathogen.
