The blood that nourishes the brain and spinal cord is behind the glial-cell-enforced blood-brain barrier, which limits
the exchange of material from blood vessels with the interstitial fluid of the nervous tissue. Thus, metabolic wastes are
collected in cerebrospinal fluid that circulates through the CNS. This fluid is produced by filtering blood at the choroid
plexuses in the four ventricles of the brain. It then circulates through the ventricles and into the subarachnoid space, between
the pia mater and the arachnoid mater. From the arachnoid granulations, CSF is reabsorbed into the blood, removing the
waste from the privileged central nervous tissue.

 The blood, now with the reabsorbed CSF, drains out of the cranium through the dural sinuses. The dura mater is the
tough outer covering of the CNS, which is anchored to the inner surface of the cranial and vertebral cavities. It surrounds
the venous space known as the dural sinuses, which connect to the jugular veins, where blood drains from the head and
neck.
