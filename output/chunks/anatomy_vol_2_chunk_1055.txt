Figure 19.29 Heart Sounds and the Cardiac Cycle In this illustration, the x-axis reflects time with a recording of the
heart sounds. The y-axis represents pressure.

 The term murmur is used to describe an unusual sound coming from the heart that is caused by the turbulent flow of
blood. Murmurs are graded on a scale of 1 to 6, with 1 being the most common, the most difficult sound to detect, and the
least serious. The most severe is a 6. Phonocardiograms or auscultograms can be used to record both normal and abnormal
sounds using specialized electronic stethoscopes.

 During auscultation, it is common practice for the clinician to ask the patient to breathe deeply.
