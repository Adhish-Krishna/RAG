In this graph, a blood pressure tracing is aligned to a measurement of systolic and
diastolic pressures.

 The majority of hospitals and clinics have automated equipment for measuring blood pressure that work on the same
principles. An even more recent innovation is a small instrument that wraps around a patient’s wrist. The patient then holds
the wrist over the heart while the device measures blood flow and records pressure.

 Variables Affecting Blood Flow and Blood Pressure

Five variables influence blood flow and blood pressure:

* Cardiac output

¢ Compliance

* Volume of the blood

¢ Viscosity of the blood

* Blood vessel length and diameter

Recall that blood moves from higher pressure to lower pressure. It is pumped from the heart into the arteries at high

pressure. If you increase pressure in the arteries (afterload), and cardiac function does not compensate, blood flow will
actually decrease. In the venous system, the opposite relationship is true. Increased pressure in the veins does not decrease
flow as it does in arteries, but actually increases flow.
