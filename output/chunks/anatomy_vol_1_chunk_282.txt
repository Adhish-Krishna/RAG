Cell: Cystic Fibrosis

Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects approximately 30,000 people in the United States, with about 1,000 new cases reported
each year. The genetic disease is most well known for its damage to the lungs, causing breathing difficulties and
chronic lung infections, but it also affects the liver, pancreas, and intestines. Only about 50 years ago, the prognosis
for children born with CF was very grimâ€”a life expectancy rarely over 10 years. Today, with advances in medical
treatment, many CF patients live into their 30s.

 The symptoms of CF result from a malfunctioning membrane ion channel called the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR. In healthy people, the CFTR protein is an integral membrane protein

that transports Cl ions out of the cell. In a person who has CF, the gene for the CFTR is mutated, thus, the cell
manufactures a defective channel protein that typically is not incorporated into the membrane, but is instead degraded
by the cell.
