A primary union describes the healing of a
wound where the edges are close together. When there is a gaping wound, it takes longer to refill the area with cells and
collagen. The process called secondary union occurs as the edges of the wound are pulled together by what is called wound
contraction. When a wound is more than one quarter of an inch deep, sutures (stitches) are recommended to promote a
primary union and avoid the formation of a disfiguring scar. Regeneration is the addition of new cells of the same type as
the ones that were injured (Figure 4.21).
