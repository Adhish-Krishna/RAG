1.2 | Structural Organization of the Human Body

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the structure of the human body in terms of six levels of organization
¢ List the eleven organ systems of the human body and identify at least one organ and one major function of each

Before you begin to study the different structures and functions of the human body, it is helpful to consider its basic
architecture; that is, how its smallest parts are assembled into larger structures. It is convenient to consider the structures
of the body in terms of six fundamental levels of organization that increase in complexity: chemical, cellular, tissue, organ,
organ system, organism (Figure 1.3).
