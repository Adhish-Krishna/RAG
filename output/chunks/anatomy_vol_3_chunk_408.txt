Metabolism and Obesity

Obesity in the United States is epidemic. The rate of obesity has been steadily rising since the 1980s. In the 1990s,
most states reported that less than 10 percent of their populations was obese, and the state with the highest rate reported
that only 15 percent of their population was considered obese. By 2010, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention reported that nearly 36 percent of adults over 20 years old were obese and an additional 33 percent were
overweight, leaving only about 30 percent of the population at a healthy weight.
