Relate characteristics of an electrocardiogram to events in the cardiac cycle
Â¢ Identify blocks that can interrupt the cardiac cycle

Recall that cardiac muscle shares a few characteristics with both skeletal muscle and smooth muscle, but it has some unique
properties of its own. Not the least of these exceptional properties is its ability to initiate an electrical potential at a fixed
rate that spreads rapidly from cell to cell to trigger the contractile mechanism. This property is known as autorhythmicity.
 Neither smooth nor skeletal muscle can do this. Even though cardiac muscle has autorhythmicity, heart rate is modulated by
the endocrine and nervous systems.

 There are two major types of cardiac muscle cells: myocardial contractile cells and myocardial conducting cells. The
myocardial contractile cells constitute the bulk (99 percent) of the cells in the atria and ventricles. Contractile cells conduct
impulses and are responsible for contractions that pump blood through the body. The myocardial conducting cells (1
percent of the cells) form the conduction system of the heart.
