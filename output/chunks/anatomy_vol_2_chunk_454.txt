neuron (with the postganglionic fiber shown as a dashed line). This neuron then projects to a target effector—in this case,
the trachea—via gray rami communicantes, which are unmyelinated axons.

 In some cases, the target effectors are located superior or inferior to the spinal segment at which the preganglionic fiber
emerges. With respect to the “wiring” involved, the synapse with the ganglionic neuron occurs at chain ganglia superior
or inferior to the location of the central neuron. An example of this is spinal nerve T1 that innervates the eye. The spinal
nerve tracks up through the chain until it reaches the superior cervical ganglion, where it synapses with the postganglionic
neuron (see Figure 15.3b).
