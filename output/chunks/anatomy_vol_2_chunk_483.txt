However, the neck and shoulder would connect to the spinal cord at the mid-cervical level of the spinal
cord. These connections do not fit with the expected correspondence of visceral and somatosensory fibers entering at
the same level of the spinal cord.

 The incorrect assumption would be that the visceral sensations are coming from the spleen directly. In fact, the
visceral fibers are coming from the diaphragm. The nerve connecting to the diaphragm takes a special route. The
phrenic nerve is connected to the spinal cord at cervical levels 3 to 5. The motor fibers that make up this nerve are
responsible for the muscle contractions that drive ventilation. These fibers have left the spinal cord to enter the phrenic
nerve, meaning that spinal cord damage below the mid-cervical level is not fatal by making ventilation impossible.
 Therefore, the visceral fibers from the diaphragm enter the spinal cord at the same level as the somatosensory fibers
from the neck and shoulder.
