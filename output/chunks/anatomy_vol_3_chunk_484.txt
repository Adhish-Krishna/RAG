¢ Describe the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic forces that favor and oppose filtration

¢ Describe glomerular filtration rate (GFR), state the average value of GFR, and explain how clearance rate can be
used to measure GFR

* Predict specific factors that will increase or decrease GFR

* State the percent of the filtrate that is normally reabsorbed and explain why the process of reabsorption is so
important

¢ Calculate daily urine production

¢ List common symptoms of kidney failure

Having reviewed the anatomy and microanatomy of the urinary system, now is the time to focus on the physiology. You
will discover that different parts of the nephron utilize specific processes to produce urine: filtration, reabsorption, and
secretion. You will learn how each of these processes works and where they occur along the nephron and collecting ducts.
 The physiologic goal is to modify the composition of the plasma and, in doing so, produce the waste product urine.
