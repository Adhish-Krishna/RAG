The main sensory modalities can be described on the basis of how each is transduced.
 The chemical senses are taste and smell. The general sense that is usually referred to as touch includes chemical sensation
in the form of nociception, or pain. Pressure, vibration, muscle stretch, and the movement of hair by an external stimulus,
are all sensed by mechanoreceptors. Hearing and balance are also sensed by mechanoreceptors. Finally, vision involves the
activation of photoreceptors.

 Listing all the different sensory modalities, which can number as many as 17, involves separating the five major
senses into more specific categories, or submodalities, of the larger sense. An individual sensory modality represents the
sensation of a specific type of stimulus. For example, the general sense of touch, which is known as somatosensation, can
be separated into light pressure, deep pressure, vibration, itch, pain, temperature, or hair movement.
