Finally, a series of reactions generates glucose itself. In gluconeogenesis (as compared to glycolysis),
the enzyme hexokinase is replaced by glucose-6-phosphatase, and the enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 is replaced by
fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. This helps the cell to regulate glycolysis and gluconeogenesis independently of each other.

 As will be discussed as part of lipolysis, fats can be broken down into glycerol, which can be phosphorylated to form
dihydroxyacetone phosphate or DHAP. DHAP can either enter the glycolytic pathway or be used by the liver as a substrate
for gluconeogenesis.
