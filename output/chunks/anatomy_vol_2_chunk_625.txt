Testing this reflex can illustrate whether the optic nerve or the oculomotor nerve is damaged. If
shining the light in one eye results in no changes in pupillary size but shining light in the opposite eye elicits a normal,
bilateral response, the damage is associated with the optic nerve on the nonresponsive side. If light in either eye elicits
a response in only one eye, the problem is with the oculomotor system.

 If light in the right eye only causes the left pupil to constrict, the direct reflex is lost and the consensual reflex is
intact, which means that the right oculomotor nerve (or Eddingerâ€”Westphal nucleus) is damaged. Damage to the right
oculomotor connections will be evident when light is shined in the left eye. In that case, the direct reflex is intact but
the consensual reflex is lost, meaning that the left pupil will constrict while the right does not.
