one of the chemical groups recognized by a single type of lymphocyte antigen
receptor

B cells lymphocytes that act by differentiating into an antibody-secreting plasma cell

barrier defenses antipathogen defenses deriving from a barrier that physically prevents pathogens from entering the
body to establish an infection

bone marrow tissue found inside bones; the site of all blood cell differentiation and maturation of B lymphocytes
bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) lymphoid nodule associated with the respiratory tract
central tolerance B cell tolerance induced in immature B cells of the bone marrow

chemokine soluble, long-range, cell-to-cell communication molecule

chronic inflammation inflammation occurring for long periods of time

chyle lipid-rich lymph inside the lymphatic capillaries of the small intestine

cisterna chyli bag-like vessel that forms the beginning of the thoracic duct

class switching ability of B cells to change the class of antibody they produce without altering the specificity for
antigen

clonal anergy process whereby B cells that react to soluble antigens in bone marrow are made nonfunctional
clonal deletion removal of self-reactive B cells by inducing apoptosis

clonal expansion growth of a clone of selected lymphocytes

clonal selection stimulating growth of lymphocytes that have specific receptors

clone group of lymphocytes sharing the same antigen receptor

complement enzymatic cascade of constitutive blood proteins that have antipathogen effects, including the direct
killing of bacteria

constant region domain part of a lymphocyte antigen receptor that does not vary much between different receptor
types

cytokine soluble, short-range, cell-to-cell communication molecule

cytotoxic T cells (Tc) T lymphocytes with the ability to induce apoptosis in target cells

CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 965

delayed hypersensitivity (type IV) T cell-mediated immune response against pathogens infiltrating interstitial
tissues, causing cellular infiltrate

early induced immune response includes antimicrobial proteins stimulated during the first several days of an
infection

effector T cells immune cells with a direct, adverse effect on a pathogen
efferent lymphatic vessels lead out of a lymph node

erythroblastosis fetalis disease of Rh factor-positive newborns in Rh-negative mothers with multiple Rh-positive
children; resulting from the action of maternal antibodies against fetal blood

Fe region in an antibody molecule, the site where the two termini of the heavy chains come together; many cells have
receptors for this portion of the antibody, adding functionality to these molecules

fas ligand molecule expressed on cytotoxic T cells and NK cells that binds to the fas molecule on a target cell and
induces it do undergo apoptosis

germinal centers clusters of rapidly proliferating B cells found in secondary lymphoid tissues

graft-versus-host disease in bone marrow transplants; occurs when the transplanted cells mount an immune
response against the recipient

granzyme apoptosis-inducing substance contained in granules of NK cells and cytotoxic T cells
heavy chain larger protein chain of an antibody

helper T cells (Th) T cells that secrete cytokines to enhance other immune responses, involved in activation of both B
and T cell lymphocytes

high endothelial venules vessels containing unique endothelial cells specialized to allow migration of lymphocytes
from the blood to the lymph node

histamine vasoactive mediator in granules of mast cells and is the primary cause of allergies and anaphylactic shock

IgA antibody whose dimer is secreted by exocrine glands, is especially effective against digestive and respiratory
pathogens, and can pass immunity to an infant through breastfeeding

IgD class of antibody whose only known function is as a receptor on naive B cells; important in B cell activation
IgE antibody that binds to mast cells and causes antigen-specific degranulation during an allergic response

IgG main blood antibody of late primary and early secondary responses; passed from mother to unborn child via
placenta

IgM antibody whose monomer is a surface receptor of naive B cells; the pentamer is the first antibody made blood
plasma during primary responses

immediate hypersensitivity (type I) IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation caused by crosslinking of surface IgE by
antigen

immune system series of barriers, cells, and soluble mediators that combine to response to infections of the body with
pathogenic organisms

immunoglobulin protein antibody; occurs as one of five main classes

immunological memory ability of the adaptive immune response to mount a stronger and faster immune response
upon re-exposure to a pathogen

inflammation basic innate immune response characterized by heat, redness, pain, and swelling
innate immune response rapid but relatively nonspecific immune response
interferons early induced proteins made in virally infected cells that cause nearby cells to make antiviral proteins

light chain small protein chain of an antibody

966 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM

lymph node one of the bean-shaped organs found associated with the lymphatic vessels
lymphatic capillaries smallest of the lymphatic vessels and the origin of lymph flow

lymphatic system network of lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, and ducts that carries lymph from the tissues and back
to the bloodstream.
