It, too, empties into the posterior portion of the atria, but inferior to the opening of the superior vena cava.
 Immediately superior and slightly medial to the opening of the inferior vena cava on the posterior surface of the atrium is
the opening of the coronary sinus. This thin-walled vessel drains most of the coronary veins that return systemic blood from
the heart. The majority of the internal heart structures discussed in this and subsequent sections are illustrated in Figure
19.9.

 While the bulk of the internal surface of the right atrium is smooth, the depression of the fossa ovalis is medial, and the
anterior surface demonstrates prominent ridges of muscle called the pectinate muscles. The right auricle also has pectinate
muscles. The left atrium does not have pectinate muscles except in the auricle.

 The atria receive venous blood on a nearly continuous basis, preventing venous flow from stopping while the ventricles
are contracting.
