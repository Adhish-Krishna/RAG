The extra oxygen carried by these blood cells can then be used by muscles for aerobic respiration. Human
growth hormone (hGH) is another supplement, and although it can facilitate building muscle mass, its main role is to
promote the healing of muscle and other tissues after strenuous exercise. Increased hGH may allow for faster recovery after
muscle damage, reducing the rest required after exercise, and allowing for more sustained high-level performance.

 Although performance-enhancing substances often do improve performance, most are banned by governing bodies in
sports and are illegal for nonmedical purposes. Their use to enhance performance raises ethical issues of cheating because
they give users an unfair advantage over nonusers. A greater concern, however, is that their use carries serious health risks.
 The side effects of these substances are often significant, nonreversible, and in some cases fatal. The physiological strain
caused by these substances is often greater than what the body can handle, leading to effects that are unpredictable and
dangerous.
