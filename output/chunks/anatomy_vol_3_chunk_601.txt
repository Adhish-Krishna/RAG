The kidney excretes 100 to 1200 milliosmoles of solutes per day
to rid the body of a variety of excess salts and other water-soluble chemical wastes, most notably creatinine, urea, and uric
acid. Failure to produce the minimum volume of urine means that metabolic wastes cannot be effectively removed from
the body, a situation that can impair organ function. The minimum level of urine production necessary to maintain normal
function is about 0.47 liters (0.5 quarts) per day.

 The kidneys also must make adjustments in the event of ingestion of too much fluid. Diuresis, which is the production
of urine in excess of normal levels, begins about 30 minutes after drinking a large quantity of fluid. Diuresis reaches a peak
after about 1 hour, and normal urine production is reestablished after about 3 hours.

 Role of ADH

Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, controls the amount of water reabsorbed from the collecting
ducts and tubules in the kidney.
