The negative charge is localized in the large anions.

 With the ions distributed across the membrane at these concentrations, the difference in charge is measured at -70
mV, the value described as the resting membrane potential. The exact value measured for the resting membrane potential
varies between cells, but -70 mV is most commonly used as this value. This voltage would actually be much lower except

for the contributions of some important proteins in the membrane. Leakage channels allow Na‚Äù to slowly move into the cell

or K* to slowly move out, and the Na*/K* pump restores them. This may appear to be a waste of energy, but each has a role
in maintaining the membrane potential.

 The Action Potential

Resting membrane potential describes the steady state of the cell, which is a dynamic process that is balanced by ion
leakage and ion pumping. Without any outside influence, it will not change. To get an electrical signal started, the membrane
potential has to change.
