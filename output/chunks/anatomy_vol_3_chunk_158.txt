Both the mouth and anus are open to the
external environment; thus, food and wastes within the alimentary canal are technically considered to be outside the body.
 Only through the process of absorption do the nutrients in food enter into and nourish the body’s “inner space.”

Accessory Structures

Each accessory digestive organ aids in the breakdown of food (Figure 23.3). Within the mouth, the teeth and tongue begin
mechanical digestion, whereas the salivary glands begin chemical digestion. Once food products enter the small intestine,
the gallbladder, liver, and pancreas release secretions—such as bile and enzymes—essential for digestion to continue.
 Together, these are called accessory organs because they sprout from the lining cells of the developing gut (mucosa) and
augment its function; indeed, you could not live without their vital contributions, and many significant diseases result from
their malfunction.
