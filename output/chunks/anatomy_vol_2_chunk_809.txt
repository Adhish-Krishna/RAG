 17.11 Development and Aging of the Endocrine System

The endocrine system originates from all three germ layers of the embryo, including the endoderm, ectoderm, and
mesoderm. In general, different hormone classes arise from distinct germ layers. Aging affects the endocrine glands,
potentially affecting hormone production and secretion, and can cause disease. The production of hormones, such as human
growth hormone, cortisol, aldosterone, sex hormones, and the thyroid hormones, decreases with age.
