Moreover, endocrine glands scattered throughout the body release their products, called hormones, into the bloodstream,
which carries them to distant target cells. Blood also picks up cellular wastes and byproducts, and transports them to various
organs for removal. For instance, blood moves carbon dioxide to the lungs for exhalation from the body, and various waste
products are transported to the kidneys and liver for excretion from the body in the form of urine or bile.

 Defense

Many types of WBCs protect the body from external threats, such as disease-causing bacteria that have entered the
bloodstream in a wound. Other WBCs seek out and destroy internal threats, such as cells with mutated DNA that could
multiply to become cancerous, or body cells infected with viruses.

 When damage to the vessels results in bleeding, blood platelets and certain proteins dissolved in the plasma, the fluid
portion of the blood, interact to block the ruptured areas of the blood vessels involved.
