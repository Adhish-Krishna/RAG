Henry’s law states that gas molecules dissolve in a liquid proportional to their partial pressure. 45 The damaged alveoli
will have insufficient ventilation, causing the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli to decrease. As a result, the pulmonary
capillaries serving these alveoli will constrict, redirecting blood flow to other alveoli that are receiving sufficient ventilation. 46
Both adult and fetal hemoglobin transport oxygen via iron molecules. However, fetal hemoglobin has about a 20-fold greater
affinity for oxygen than does adult hemoglobin. This is due to a difference in structure; fetal hemoglobin has two subunits that
have a slightly different structure than the subunits of adult hemoglobin. 47 The relationship between the partial pressure of
oxygen and the binding of hemoglobin to oxygen is described by the oxygen—hemoglobin saturation/dissociation curve. As the
partial pressure of oxygen increases, the number of oxygen molecules bound by hemoglobin increases, thereby increasing the
saturation of hemoglobin.
