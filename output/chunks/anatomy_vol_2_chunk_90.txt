After graduating with a Ph.D., researchers will go on to find specialized work called a postdoctoral fellowship within
established labs. In this position, a researcher starts to establish their own research career with the hopes of finding an
academic position at a research university.

 Other options are available if you are interested in how the nervous system works. Especially for neurophysiology,
a medical degree might be more suitable so you can learn about the clinical applications of neurophysiology and
possibly work with human subjects. An academic career is not a necessity. Biotechnology firms are eager to find
motivated scientists ready to tackle the tough questions about how the nervous system works so that therapeutic
chemicals can be tested on some of the most challenging disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s disease,
or spinal cord injury.
