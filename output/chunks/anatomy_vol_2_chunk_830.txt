Although the surface of blood vessels is relatively smooth, as blood flows through them, it experiences some friction and
resistance, especially as vessels age and lose their elasticity, thereby producing heat. This accounts for its slightly higher
temperature.

 The pH of blood averages about 7.4; however, it can range from 7.35 to 7.45 in a healthy person. Blood is therefore
somewhat more basic (alkaline) on a chemical scale than pure water, which has a pH of 7.0. Blood contains numerous
buffers that actually help to regulate pH.

Blood constitutes approximately 8 percent of adult body weight. Adult males typically average about 5 to 6 liters of
blood. Females average 4—5 liters.

 Blood Plasma

Like other fluids in the body, plasma is composed primarily of water: In fact, it is about 92 percent water. Dissolved
or suspended within this water is a mixture of substances, most of which are proteins. There are literally hundreds of
substances dissolved or suspended in the plasma, although many of them are found only in very small quantities.
