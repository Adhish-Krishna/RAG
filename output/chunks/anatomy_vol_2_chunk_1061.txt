As one ages, the ability to generate maximum rates decreases. This may be estimated by taking the
maximal value of 220 bpm and subtracting the individualâ€™s age. So a 40-year-old individual would be expected to hit a
maximum rate of approximately 180, and a 60-year-old person would achieve a HR of 160.

For an adult, normal resting HR will be in the range of 60-100 bpm. Bradycardia is the condition in which resting
rate drops below 60 bpm, and tachycardia is the condition in which the resting rate is above 100 bpm. Trained athletes
typically have very low HRs. If the patient is not exhibiting other symptoms, such as weakness, fatigue, dizziness,
fainting, chest discomfort, palpitations, or respiratory distress, bradycardia is not considered clinically significant.
