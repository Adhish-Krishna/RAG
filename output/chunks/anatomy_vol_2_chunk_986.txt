The two atrioventricular valves are open; the two semilunar valves are closed. The atria
and vessels have been removed. (b) A frontal section through the heart illustrates blood flow through the mitral valve.
 When the mitral valve is open, it allows blood to move from the left atrium to the left ventricle. The aortic semilunar
valve is closed to prevent backflow of blood from the aorta to the left ventricle.

 Figure 19.14a shows the atrioventricular valves closed while the two semilunar valves are open. This occurs when the
ventricles contract to eject blood into the pulmonary trunk and aorta. Closure of the two atrioventricular valves prevents
blood from being forced back into the atria. This stage can be seen from a frontal view in Figure 19.14b.
