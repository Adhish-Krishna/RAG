39 The major
structures comprising the filtration membrane are fenestrations and podocyte fenestra, fused basement membrane, and filtration
slits. 40 Net filtration pressure (NFP) = glomerular blood hydrostatic pressure (GBHP) — [capsular hydrostatic pressure (CHP) +
blood colloid osmotic pressure (BCOP)] 41 Symptoms of kidney failure are weakness, lethargy, shortness of breath, widespread
edema, anemia, metabolic acidosis or alkalosis, heart arrhythmias, uremia, loss of appetite, fatigue, excessive urination, and
oliguria. 42 The vasa recta and loop of Henle are involved in countercurrent multiplication. 43 The approximate osmolarities
are: CT = 300; deepest loop = 1200; DCT = 100; and collecting ducts = 100-1200. 44 Sodium concentration in the filtrate
increases when GFR increases; it will decrease when GFR decreases. 45 To excrete more Na’ in the urine, increase the flow
rate. 46 The liver produces angiotensinogen, the lungs produce ACE, and the kidneys produce renin.
