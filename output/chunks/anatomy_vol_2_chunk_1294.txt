Two of
these shunts divert blood from the pulmonary to the systemic circuit, whereas the third connects the umbilical vein to the
inferior vena cava. The first two shunts are critical during fetal life, when the lungs are compressed, filled with amniotic
fluid, and nonfunctional, and gas exchange is provided by the placenta. These shunts close shortly after birth, however,
when the newborn begins to breathe. The third shunt persists a bit longer but becomes nonfunctional once the umbilical
cord is severed. The three shunts are as follows (Figure 20.44):

Â¢ The foramen ovale is an opening in the interatrial septum that allows blood to flow from the right atrium to the left
atrium. A valve associated with this opening prevents backflow of blood during the fetal period. As the newborn begins
to breathe and blood pressure in the atria increases, this shunt closes. The fossa ovalis remains in the interatrial septum
after birth, marking the location of the former foramen ovale.
