Urine pH typically varies in a normal range from 4.5 to 8.0.

 Regulation of Nitrogen Wastes
Nitrogen wastes are produced by the breakdown of proteins during normal metabolism. Proteins are broken down into
amino acids, which in turn are deaminated by having their nitrogen groups removed. Deamination converts the amino (NH2)

groups into ammonia (NH3), ammonium ion (NHa"), urea, or uric acid (Figure 25.22). Ammonia is extremely toxic, so
most of it is very rapidly converted into urea in the liver. Human urinary wastes typically contain primarily urea with small
amounts of ammonium and very little uric acid.

Elimination of Drugs and Hormones

Water-soluble drugs may be excreted in the urine and are influenced by one or all of the following processes: glomerular
filtration, tubular secretion, or tubular reabsorption.
