(a) In phagocytosis, which is relatively nonselective, the cell takes ina
large particle. (b) In pinocytosis, the cell takes in small particles in fluid. (c) In contrast, receptor-mediated endocytosis
is quite selective. When external receptors bind a specific ligand, the cell responds by endocytosing the ligand.

 Phagocytosis and pinocytosis take in large portions of extracellular material, and they are typically not highly selective
in the substances they bring in. Cells regulate the endocytosis of specific substances via receptor-mediated endocytosis.
 Receptor-mediated endocytosis is endocytosis by a portion of the cell membrane that contains many receptors that are
specific for a certain substance. Once the surface receptors have bound sufficient amounts of the specific substance (the
receptorâ€™s ligand), the cell will endocytose the part of the cell membrane containing the receptor-ligand complexes.
