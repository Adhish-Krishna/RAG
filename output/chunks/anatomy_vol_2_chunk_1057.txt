The autorhythmicity inherent in cardiac cells keeps the heart beating at a regular pace; however, the heart is regulated by
and responds to outside influences as well. Neural and endocrine controls are vital to the regulation of cardiac function. In
addition, the heart is sensitive to several environmental factors, including electrolytes.

 Resting Cardiac Output

Cardiac output (CO) is a measurement of the amount of blood pumped by each ventricle in one minute. To calculate this
value, multiply stroke volume (SV), the amount of blood pumped by each ventricle, by heart rate (HR), in contractions
per minute (or beats per minute, bpm).
