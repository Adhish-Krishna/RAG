The synchondrosis is thus replaced by a synostosis. Permanent

CHAPTER 9| JOINTS 371

synchondroses that do not ossify are found at the first sternocostal joint and between the anterior ends of the bony ribs and
the junction with their costal cartilage. A symphysis is where the bones are joined by fibrocartilage and the gap between
the bones may be narrow or wide. A narrow symphysis is found at the manubriosternal joint and at the pubic symphysis.
 A wide symphysis is the intervertebral symphysis in which the bodies of adjacent vertebrae are united by an intervertebral
disc.

9.4 Synovial Joints

Synovial joints are the most common type of joints in the body. They are characterized by the presence of a joint cavity,
inside of which the bones of the joint articulate with each other. The articulating surfaces of the bones at a synovial joint
are not directly connected to each other by connective tissue or cartilage, which allows the bones to move freely against
each other.
