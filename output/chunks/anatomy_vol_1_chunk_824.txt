However, if the pull produced by the medial and lateral sides of the quadriceps femoris muscle is not properly
balanced, abnormal tracking of the patella toward the lateral side may occur. With continued use, this produces pain
and could result in damage to the articulating surfaces of the patella and femur, and the possible future development of
arthritis. Treatment generally involves stopping the activity that produces knee pain for a period of time, followed by a
gradual resumption of activity. Proper strengthening of the quadriceps femoris muscle to correct for imbalances is also
important to help prevent reoccurrence.

Anterior view

Figure 8.17 The Q-Angle The Q-angle is a measure of the amount of lateral deviation of the femur from the
vertical line of the tibia. Adult females have a larger Q-angle due to their wider pelvis than adult males.
