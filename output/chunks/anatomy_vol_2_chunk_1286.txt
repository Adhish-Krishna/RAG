The flow chart summarizes venous flow from the lower limb.

 Veins of the Lower Limbs

Vessel Description

Plantar veins Drain the foot and flow into the plantar venous arch

Dorsal venous

arch Drains blood from digital veins and vessels on the superior surface of the foot

Plantar venous
arch

Formed from the plantar veins; flows into the anterior and posterior tibial veins through
anastomoses

Anterior tibial
vein

Formed from the dorsal venous arch; drains the area near the tibialis anterior muscle and
flows into the popliteal vein

Posterior tibial
vein

Formed from the dorsal venous arch; drains the area near the posterior surface of the tibia
and flows into the popliteal vein

Fibular vein Drains the muscles and integument near the fibula and flows into the popliteal vein

Small
saphenous vein

Located on the lateral surface of the leg; drains blood from the superficial regions of the
lower leg and foot, and flows into the popliteal vein

Drains the region behind the knee and forms from the fusion of the fibular, anterior, and

Popliteal vein posterior tibial veins; flows into the femoral vein

Veins of the Lower Limbs

Vessel Description

Great Prominent surface vessel located on the medial surface of the leg and thigh; drains the
saphenous vein | superficial portions of these areas and flows into the femoral vein

Deep femoral

vein Drains blood from the deeper portions of the thigh and flows into the femoral vein

Femoral Forms a loop around the femur just inferior to the trochanters; drains blood from the areas
circumflex vein | around the head and neck of the femur; flows into the femoral vein

Drains the upper leg; receives blood from the great saphenous vein, the deep femoral vein,
Femoral vein and the femoral circumflex vein; becomes the external iliac vein when it crosses the body

wall
External iliac Formed when the femoral vein passes into the body cavity; drains the legs and flows into
vein the common iliac vein
Internal iliac Drains the pelvic organs and integument; formed from several smaller veins in the region;
vein flows into the common iliac vein
