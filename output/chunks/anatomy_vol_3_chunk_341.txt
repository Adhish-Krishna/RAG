Figure 24.5 Glycolysis Overview During the energy-consuming phase of glycolysis, two ATPs are consumed,
transferring two phosphates to the glucose molecule. The glucose molecule then splits into two three-carbon
compounds, each containing a phosphate. During the second phase, an additional phosphate is added to each of
the three-carbon compounds. The energy for this endergonic reaction is provided by the removal (oxidation) of two
electrons from each three-carbon compound.
