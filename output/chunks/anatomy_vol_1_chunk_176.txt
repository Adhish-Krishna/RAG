CHAPTER 2 | THE CHEMICAL LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION 61

Water as a Heat Sink

A heat sink is a substance or object that absorbs and dissipates heat but does not experience a corresponding increase in
temperature. In the body, water absorbs the heat generated by chemical reactions without greatly increasing in temperature.
 Moreover, when the environmental temperature soars, the water stored in the body helps keep the body cool. This cooling
effect happens as warm blood from the body’s core flows to the blood vessels just under the skin and is transferred to the
environment. At the same time, sweat glands release warm water in sweat. As the water evaporates into the air, it carries
away heat, and then the cooler blood from the periphery circulates back to the body core.
