In this condition, the brain isn’t supplied with enough of its fuel—glucose—to produce all of the ATP it requires to
function.

 Ketoacidosis can be severe and, if not detected and treated properly, can lead to diabetic coma, which can be
fatal. A common early symptom of ketoacidosis is deep, rapid breathing as the body attempts to drive off CO2 and
compensate for the acidosis. Another common symptom is fruity-smelling breath, due to the exhalation of acetone.
 Other symptoms include dry skin and mouth, a flushed face, nausea, vomiting, and stomach pain. Treatment for
diabetic coma is ingestion or injection of sugar; its prevention is the proper daily administration of insulin.

 A person who is diabetic and uses insulin can initiate ketoacidosis if a dose of insulin is missed. Among people
with type 2 diabetes, those of Hispanic and African-American descent are more likely to go into ketoacidosis than
those of other ethnic backgrounds, although the reason for this is unknown.
