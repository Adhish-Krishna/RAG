Following ovulation, the secondary oocyte surrounded by a few granulosa cells is released into the peritoneal cavity.
 The nearby uterine tube, either left or right, receives the oocyte. Unlike sperm, oocytes lack flagella, and therefore cannot
move on their own. So how do they travel into the uterine tube and toward the uterus? High concentrations of estrogen that
occur around the time of ovulation induce contractions of the smooth muscle along the length of the uterine tube. These
contractions occur every 4 to 8 seconds, and the result is a coordinated movement that sweeps the surface of the ovary and
the pelvic cavity. Current flowing toward the uterus is generated by coordinated beating of the cilia that line the outside
and lumen of the length of the uterine tube. These cilia beat more strongly in response to the high estrogen concentrations
that occur around the time of ovulation. As a result of these mechanisms, the oocyteâ€”granulosa cell complex is pulled into
the interior of the tube.
