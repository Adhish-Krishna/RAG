While a few exceptionally trained aerobic
athletes demonstrate resting heart rates in the range of 30-40 beats per minute (the lowest recorded figure is 28 beats per
minute for Miguel Indurain, a cyclist), for most individuals, rates lower than 50 beats per minute would indicate a condition
called bradycardia. Depending upon the specific individual, as rates fall much below this level, the heart would be unable
to maintain adequate flow of blood to vital tissues, initially resulting in decreasing loss of function across the systems,
unconsciousness, and ultimately death.

 Electrocardiogram

By careful placement of surface electrodes on the body, it is possible to record the complex, compound electrical signal of
the heart. This tracing of the electrical signal is the electrocardiogram (ECG), also commonly abbreviated EKG (K coming
kardiology, from the German term for cardiology). Careful analysis of the ECG reveals a detailed picture of both normal and
abnormal heart function, and is an indispensable clinical diagnostic tool.
