Resistance exercise causes hypertrophy. Power-producing muscles have a higher number of FG fibers
than of slow fibers. Strenuous exercise causes muscle cell damage that requires time to heal. Some athletes use performance-
enhancing substances to enhance muscle performance. Muscle atrophy due to age is called sarcopenia and occurs as muscle
fibers die and are replaced by connective and adipose tissue.

10.7 Cardiac Muscle Tissue

Cardiac muscle is striated muscle that is present only in the heart. Cardiac muscle fibers have a single nucleus, are branched,
and joined to one another by intercalated discs that contain gap junctions for depolarization between cells and desmosomes

to hold the fibers together when the heart contracts. Contraction in each cardiac muscle fiber is triggered by Ca** ions in

a similar manner as skeletal muscle, but here the Ca** ions come from SR and through voltage-gated calcium channels
