As the fluid waves move through the scala vestibuli and scala
tympani, the basilar membrane moves at a specific spot, depending on the frequency of the waves. Higher frequency waves
move the region of the basilar membrane that is close to the base of the cochlea. Lower frequency waves move the region
of the basilar membrane that is near the tip of the cochlea.

Figure 14.7 Cross Section of the Cochlea The three major spaces within the cochlea are highlighted. The scala
tympani and scala vestibuli lie on either side of the cochlear duct. The organ of Corti, containing the mechanoreceptor
hair cells, is adjacent to the scala tympani, where it sits atop the basilar membrane.

 The organs of Corti contain hair cells, which are named for the hair-like stereocilia extending from the cell’s apical
surfaces (Figure 14.8).
