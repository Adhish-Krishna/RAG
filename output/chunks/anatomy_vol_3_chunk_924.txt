36 The four components of a negative
eedback loop are: stimulus, sensor, control center, and effector. If too great a quantity of the chemical were excreted, sensors
would activate a control center, which would in turn activate an effector. In this case, the effector (the secreting cells) would be
adjusted downward. 37 Any prolonged exposure to extreme cold would activate the brain’s heat-gain center. This would reduce
blood flow to your skin, and shunt blood returning from your limbs away from the digits and into a network of deep veins. Your
brain’s heat-gain center would also increase your muscle contraction, causing you to shiver. This increases the energy consumption
of skeletal muscle and generates more heat. Your body would also produce thyroid hormone and epinephrine, chemicals that
promote increased metabolism and heat production. 38 If the body were supine or prone, the MRI scanner would move from top
to bottom to produce frontal sections, which would divide the body into anterior and posterior portions, as in “cutting” a deck of
cards.
