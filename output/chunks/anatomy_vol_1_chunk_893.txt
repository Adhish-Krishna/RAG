Which of the
bones in this image do not show an epiphyseal plate (epiphyseal gap)?

336 CHAPTER 9 | JOINTS

Examples of permanent synchondroses are found in the thoracic cage. One example is the first sternocostal joint, where
the first rib is anchored to the manubrium by its costal cartilage. (The articulations of the remaining costal cartilages to the
sternum are all synovial joints.) Additional synchondroses are formed where the anterior end of the other 11 ribs is joined
to its costal cartilage. Unlike the temporary synchondroses of the epiphyseal plate, these permanent synchondroses retain
their hyaline cartilage and thus do not ossify with age. Due to the lack of movement between the bone and cartilage, both
temporary and permanent synchondroses are functionally classified as a synarthrosis.

 Symphysis

A cartilaginous joint where the bones are joined by fibrocartilage is called a symphysis (“growing together”). Fibrocartilage
is very strong because it contains numerous bundles of thick collagen fibers, thus giving it a much greater ability to
resist pulling and bending forces when compared with hyaline cartilage.
