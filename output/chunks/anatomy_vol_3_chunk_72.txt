Concentration changes in
certain substances, such as carbon dioxide or hydrogen ions, stimulate these receptors, which in turn signal the respiration
centers of the brain. In the case of carbon dioxide, as the concentration of CO? in the blood increases, it readily diffuses
across the blood-brain barrier, where it collects in the extracellular fluid. As will be explained in more detail later, increased
carbon dioxide levels lead to increased levels of hydrogen ions, decreasing pH. The increase in hydrogen ions in the
brain triggers the central chemoreceptors to stimulate the respiratory centers to initiate contraction of the diaphragm and
intercostal muscles. As a result, the rate and depth of respiration increase, allowing more carbon dioxide to be expelled,
which brings more air into and out of the lungs promoting a reduction in the blood levels of carbon dioxide, and therefore
hydrogen ions, in the blood.
