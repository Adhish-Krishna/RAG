Digestive Processes

The processes of digestion include six activities: ingestion, propulsion, mechanical or physical digestion, chemical
digestion, absorption, and defecation.

 The first of these processes, ingestion, refers to the entry of food into the alimentary canal through the mouth. There,
the food is chewed and mixed with saliva, which contains enzymes that begin breaking down the carbohydrates in the food
plus some lipid digestion via lingual lipase. Chewing increases the surface area of the food and allows an appropriately
sized bolus to be produced.

 Food leaves the mouth when the tongue and pharyngeal muscles propel it into the esophagus.
