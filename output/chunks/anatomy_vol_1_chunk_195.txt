Organic compounds typically consist of groups of carbon atoms covalently bonded to hydrogen, usually oxygen, and
often other elements as well. Created by living things, they are found throughout the world, in soils and seas, commercial
products, and every cell of the human body. The four types most important to human structure and function are
carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleotides. Before exploring these compounds, you need to first understand the
chemistry of carbon.

 The Chemistry of Carbon

What makes organic compounds ubiquitous is the chemistry of their carbon core.
