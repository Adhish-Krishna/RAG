Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/3Dmovies) to learn about the side effects of 3-D movies. As discussed
in this video, movies that are shot in 3-D can cause motion sickness, which elicits the autonomic symptoms of nausea
and sweating. The disconnection between the perceived motion on the screen and the lack of any change in equilibrium
stimulates these symptoms. Why do you think sitting close to the screen or right in the middle of the theater makes
motion sickness during a 3-D movie worse?
