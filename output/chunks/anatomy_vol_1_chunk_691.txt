These curves increase the vertebral columnâ€™s strength, flexibility, and ability to absorb shock. When the load on the
spine is increased, by carrying a heavy backpack for example, the curvatures increase in depth (become more curved) to
accommodate the extra weight. They then spring back when the weight is removed. The four adult curvatures are classified
as either primary or secondary curvatures. Primary curves are retained from the original fetal curvature, while secondary
curvatures develop after birth.

 During fetal development, the body is flexed anteriorly into the fetal position, giving the entire vertebral column a
single curvature that is concave anteriorly. In the adult, this fetal curvature is retained in two regions of the vertebral column
as the thoracic curve, which involves the thoracic vertebrae, and the sacrococcygeal curve, formed by the sacrum and
