842 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION

Tunica Media

The tunica media is the substantial middle layer of the vessel wall (see Figure 20.3). It is generally the thickest layer in
arteries, and it is much thicker in arteries than it is in veins. The tunica media consists of layers of smooth muscle supported
by connective tissue that is primarily made up of elastic fibers, most of which are arranged in circular sheets. Toward the
outer portion of the tunic, there are also layers of longitudinal muscle. Contraction and relaxation of the circular muscles
decrease and increase the diameter of the vessel lumen, respectively. Specifically in arteries, vasoconstriction decreases
blood flow as the smooth muscle in the walls of the tunica media contracts, making the lumen narrower and increasing blood
pressure. Similarly, vasodilation increases blood flow as the smooth muscle relaxes, allowing the lumen to widen and blood
pressure to drop.
