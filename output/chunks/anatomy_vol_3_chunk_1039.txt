Both the oropharynx and laryngopharynx are passageways for air and food and

drink. 37 The epiglottis is a region of the larynx that is important during the swallowing of food or drink. As a person swallows,
the pharynx moves upward and the epiglottis closes over the trachea, preventing food or drink from entering the trachea. If a
personâ€™s epiglottis were injured, this mechanism would be impaired. As a result, the person may have problems with food or drink
entering the trachea, and possibly, the lungs. Over time, this may cause infections such as pneumonia to set in. 38 The conducting
zone of the respiratory system includes the organs and structures that are not directly involved in gas exchange, but perform
other duties such as providing a passageway for air, trapping and removing debris and pathogens, and warming and humidifying
incoming air.
