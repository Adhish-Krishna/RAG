To elicit a response to such antigens, the B and T cells must
come close together (Figure 21.25). The B cell must receive two signals to become activated. Its surface immunoglobulin
must recognize native antigen. Some of this antigen is internalized, processed, and presented to the Th2 cells on a class II
MHC molecule. The T cell then binds using its antigen receptor and is activated to secrete cytokines that diffuse to the B
cell, finally activating it completely. Thus, the B cell receives signals from both its surface antibody and the T cell via its
cytokines, and acts as a professional antigen-presenting cell in the process.
