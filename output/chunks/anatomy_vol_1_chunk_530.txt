Skin grafts are required when the damage from trauma or infection cannot be closed with sutures or staples. Watch this

 Scars and Keloids

Most cuts or wounds, with the exception of ones that only scratch the surface (the epidermis), lead to scar formation. A scar
is collagen-rich skin formed after the process of wound healing that differs from normal skin. Scarring occurs in cases in
which there is repair of skin damage, but the skin fails to regenerate the original skin structure. Fibroblasts generate scar
tissue in the form of collagen, and the bulk of repair is due to the basket-weave pattern generated by collagen fibers and
does not result in regeneration of the typical cellular structure of skin.
