 Figure 24.21 Absorptive State During the absorptive state, the body digests food and absorbs the nutrients.

 The Postabsorptive State

The postabsorptive state, or the fasting state, occurs when the food has been digested, absorbed, and stored. You commonly
fast overnight, but skipping meals during the day puts your body in the postabsorptive state as well. During this state, the
body must rely initially on stored glycogen. Glucose levels in the blood begin to drop as it is absorbed and used by the
cells. In response to the decrease in glucose, insulin levels also drop. Glycogen and triglyceride storage slows. However,
due to the demands of the tissues and organs, blood glucose levels must be maintained in the normal range of 80-120 mg/
dL.
