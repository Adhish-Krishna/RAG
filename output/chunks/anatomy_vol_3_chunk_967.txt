The female sacral
promontory does not project anteriorly as far as it does in males, which gives the pelvic brim (pelvic inlet) of the female a rounded
or oval shape. The lesser pelvic cavity is wider and more shallow in females, and the pelvic outlet is larger than in males. Thus, the
greater width of the female pelvis, with its larger pelvic inlet, lesser pelvis, and pelvic outlet, are important for childbirth because
the baby must pass through the pelvis during delivery. 39 The lower limb is divided into three regions. The thigh is the region
located between the hip and knee joints. It contains the femur and the patella. The hip joint is formed by the articulation between
the acetabulum of the hip bone and the head of the femur. The leg is the region between the knee and ankle joints, and contains
the tibia (medially) and the fibula (laterally).
