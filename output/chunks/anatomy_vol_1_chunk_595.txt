6.6 | Exercise, Nutrition, Hormones, and Bone Tissue

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the effect exercise has on bone tissue
¢ List the nutrients that affect bone health
¢ Discuss the role those nutrients play in bone health
¢ Describe the effects of hormones on bone tissue

All of the organ systems of your body are interdependent, and the skeletal system is no exception. The food you take in via
your digestive system and the hormones secreted by your endocrine system affect your bones. Even using your muscles to
engage in exercise has an impact on your bones.

 Exercise and Bone Tissue

During long space missions, astronauts can lose approximately 1 to 2 percent of their bone mass per month. This loss of
bone mass is thought to be caused by the lack of mechanical stress on astronauts’ bones due to the low gravitational forces
in space.
