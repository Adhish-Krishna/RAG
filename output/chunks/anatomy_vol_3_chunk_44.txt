In addition, innervation by the both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems provides an important
level of control through dilation and constriction of the airway.

 Blood Supply

The major function of the lungs is to perform gas exchange, which requires blood from the pulmonary circulation. This
blood supply contains deoxygenated blood and travels to the lungs where erythrocytes, also known as red blood cells,
pick up oxygen to be transported to tissues throughout the body. The pulmonary artery is an artery that arises from the
pulmonary trunk and carries deoxygenated, arterial blood to the alveoli. The pulmonary artery branches multiple times as it
follows the bronchi, and each branch becomes progressively smaller in diameter. One arteriole and an accompanying venule
supply and drain one pulmonary lobule. As they near the alveoli, the pulmonary arteries become the pulmonary capillary
network. The pulmonary capillary network consists of tiny vessels with very thin walls that lack smooth muscle fibers. The
capillaries branch and follow the bronchioles and structure of the alveoli.
