They can recommend therapeutic or rehabilitative exercises, and some also include acupuncture, massage
therapy, or ultrasound as part of the treatment program. In addition to those in general practice, some chiropractors
specialize in sport injuries, neurology, orthopaedics, pediatrics, nutrition, internal disorders, or diagnostic imaging.

To become a chiropractor, students must have 3-4 years of undergraduate education, attend an accredited, four-
year Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) degree program, and pass a licensure examination to be licensed for practice in their
state. With the aging of the baby-boom generation, employment for chiropractors is expected to increase.
