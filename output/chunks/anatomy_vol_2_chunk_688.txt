Some of these glands have both endocrine and non-endocrine functions. For example, the pancreas contains cells that
function in digestion as well as cells that secrete the hormones insulin and glucagon, which regulate blood glucose levels.
 The hypothalamus, thymus, heart, kidneys, stomach, small intestine, liver, skin, female ovaries, and male testes are other
organs that contain cells with endocrine function. Moreover, adipose tissue has long been known to produce hormones, and
recent research has revealed that even bone tissue has endocrine functions.
