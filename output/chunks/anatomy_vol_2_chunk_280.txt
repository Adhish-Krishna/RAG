The output influences the activity of part of the thalamus that can then increase or decrease
cortical activity that often results in changes to motor commands. The basal forebrain is responsible for modulating cortical
activity in attention and memory. The limbic system includes deep cerebral nuclei that are responsible for emotion and
memory.

 The diencephalon includes the thalamus and the hypothalamus, along with some other structures. The thalamus is
a relay between the cerebrum and the rest of the nervous system. The hypothalamus coordinates homeostatic functions
through the autonomic and endocrine systems.

 The brain stem is composed of the midbrain, pons, and medulla. It controls the head and neck region of the body
through the cranial nerves. There are control centers in the brain stem that regulate the cardiovascular and respiratory
systems.

 The cerebellum is connected to the brain stem, primarily at the pons, where it receives a copy of the descending input
from the cerebrum to the spinal cord.
