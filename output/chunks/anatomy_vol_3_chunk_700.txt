Indeed, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend
that women do not douche, and that they allow the vagina to maintain its normal healthy population of protective microbia
flora.

 Ovaries

The ovaries are the female gonads (see Figure 27.9). Paired ovals, they are each about 2 to 3 cm in length, about the
size of an almond. The ovaries are located within the pelvic cavity, and are supported by the mesovarium, an extension of
the peritoneum that connects the ovaries to the broad ligament. Extending from the mesovarium itself is the suspensory
ligament that contains the ovarian blood and lymph vessels. Finally, the ovary itself is attached to the uterus via the ovarian
ligament.

 The ovary comprises an outer covering of cuboidal epithelium called the ovarian surface epithelium that is superficial
to a dense connective tissue covering called the tunica albuginea. Beneath the tunica albuginea is the cortex, or outer portion,
of the organ.
