Muscles of the Posterior Neck and the Back

The posterior muscles of the neck are primarily concerned with head movements, like extension. The back muscles stabilize
and move the vertebral column, and are grouped according to the lengths and direction of the fascicles.

 The splenius muscles originate at the midline and run laterally and superiorly to their insertions. From the sides and
the back of the neck, the splenius capitis inserts onto the head region, and the splenius cervicis extends onto the cervical
region. These muscles can extend the head, laterally flex it, and rotate it (Figure 11.15).
