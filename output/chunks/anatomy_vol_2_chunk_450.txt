More oxygen needs to be inhaled and delivered to skeletal muscle. The
respiratory, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal systems are all activated together. Additionally, sweating keeps the excess
heat that comes from muscle contraction from causing the body to overheat. The digestive system shuts down so that blood
is not absorbing nutrients when it should be delivering oxygen to skeletal muscles. To coordinate all these responses, the
connections in the sympathetic system diverge from a limited region of the central nervous system (CNS) to a wide array
of ganglia that project to the many effector organs simultaneously. The complex set of structures that compose the output of
the sympathetic system make it possible for these disparate effectors to come together in a coordinated, systemic change.

 The sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system influences the various organ systems of the body through
connections emerging from the thoracic and upper lumbar spinal cord.
