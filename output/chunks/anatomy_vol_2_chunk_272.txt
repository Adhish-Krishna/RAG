Nervous System

Anosmia is the loss of the sense of smell. It is often the result of the olfactory nerve being severed, usually because
of blunt force trauma to the head. The sensory neurons of the olfactory epithelium have a limited lifespan of
approximately one to four months, and new ones are made on a regular basis. The new neurons extend their axons
into the CNS by growing along the existing fibers of the olfactory nerve. The ability of these neurons to be replaced is
lost with age.
