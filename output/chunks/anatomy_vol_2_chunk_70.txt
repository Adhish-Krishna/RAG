Nutrient molecules, such as glucose or amino acids, can pass through the BBB, but other
molecules cannot. This actually causes problems with drug delivery to the CNS. Pharmaceutical companies are challenged
to design drugs that can cross the BBB as well as have an effect on the nervous system.

Figure 12.11 Glial Cells of the CNS The CNS has astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and ependymal cells that
support the neurons of the CNS in several ways.

 Like a few other parts of the body, the brain has a privileged blood supply. Very little can pass through by diffusion.
 Most substances that cross the wall of a blood vessel into the CNS must do so through an active transport process. Because
of this, only specific types of molecules can enter the CNS. Glucose—the primary energy source—is allowed, as are amino
acids. Water and some other small particles, like gases and ions, can enter.
