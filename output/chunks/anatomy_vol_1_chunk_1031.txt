This triggers the release of calcium ions (Ca**) from storage in the sarcoplasmic

reticulum (SR). The Ca" then initiates contraction, which is sustained by ATP (Figure 10.8). As long as Ca** ions remain
in the sarcoplasm to bind to troponin, which keeps the actin-binding sites “unshielded,” and as long as ATP is available to
drive the cross-bridge cycling and the pulling of actin strands by myosin, the muscle fiber will continue to shorten to an
anatomical limit.
