This
is what a protein is, but the term protein implies a certain length to the molecule. Some neuropeptides are quite short, such
as met-enkephalin, which is five amino acids long. Others are long, such as beta-endorphin, which is 31 amino acids long.
 Neuropeptides are often released at synapses in combination with another neurotransmitter, and they often act as hormones
in other systems of the body, such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or substance P.

The effect of a neurotransmitter on the postsynaptic element is entirely dependent on the receptor protein. First, if
there is no receptor protein in the membrane of the postsynaptic element, then the neurotransmitter has no effect. The
depolarizing or hyperpolarizing effect is also dependent on the receptor. When acetylcholine binds to the nicotinic receptor,

fa

the postsynaptic cell is depolarized. This is because the receptor is a cation channel and positively charged Naâ€™ will rush
into the cell.
