If an error occurs in these developmental processes, a birth defect of cleft lip or cleft
palate may result.

 Cleft lip is a common development defect that affects approximately 1:1000 births, most of which are male. This
defect involves a partial or complete failure of the right and left portions of the upper lip to fuse together, leaving a
cleft (gap).

 A more severe developmental defect is cleft palate, which affects the hard palate. The hard palate is the bony
structure that separates the nasal cavity from the oral cavity. It is formed during embryonic development by the midline
fusion of the horizontal plates from the right and left palatine bones and the palatine processes of the maxilla bones.
 Cleft palate affects approximately 1:2500 births and is more common in females. It results from a failure of the two
halves of the hard palate to completely come together and fuse at the midline, thus leaving a gap between them.
