This gives symphyses the ability to strongly unite
the adjacent bones, but can still allow for limited movement to occur. Thus, a symphysis is functionally classified as an
amphiarthrosis.

 The gap separating the bones at a symphysis may be narrow or wide. Examples in which the gap between the bones is
narrow include the pubic symphysis and the manubriosternal joint. At the pubic symphysis, the pubic portions of the right
and left hip bones of the pelvis are joined together by fibrocartilage across a narrow gap. Similarly, at the manubriosternal
joint, fibrocartilage unites the manubrium and body portions of the sternum.

 The intervertebral symphysis is a wide symphysis located between the bodies of adjacent vertebrae of the vertebral
column. Here a thick pad of fibrocartilage called an intervertebral disc strongly unites the adjacent vertebrae by filling
the gap between them. The width of the intervertebral symphysis is important because it allows for small movements
between the adjacent vertebrae.
