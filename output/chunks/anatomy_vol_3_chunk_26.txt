The uvula is a small bulbous, teardrop-shaped structure located at the apex
of the soft palate. Both the uvula and soft palate move like a pendulum during swallowing, swinging upward to close off
the nasopharynx to prevent ingested materials from entering the nasal cavity. In addition, auditory (Eustachian) tubes that
connect to each middle ear cavity open into the nasopharynx. This connection is why colds often lead to ear infections.

 The oropharynx is a passageway for both air and food. The oropharynx is bordered superiorly by the nasopharynx
and anteriorly by the oral cavity. The fauces is the opening at the connection between the oral cavity and the oropharynx.
 As the nasopharynx becomes the oropharynx, the epithelium changes from pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium
to stratified squamous epithelium. The oropharynx contains two distinct sets of tonsils, the palatine and lingual tonsils. A
palatine tonsil is one of a pair of structures located laterally in the oropharynx in the area of the fauces.
