The adult hip bone consists of three regions. The ilium forms the large, fan-shaped
superior portion, the ischium forms the posteroinferior portion, and the pubis forms the anteromedial portion.

 The ilium is the fan-like, superior region that forms the largest part of the hip bone. It is firmly united to the sacrum at
the largely immobile sacroiliac joint (see Figure 8.12). The ischium forms the posteroinferior region of each hip bone. It
supports the body when sitting. The pubis forms the anterior portion of the hip bone. The pubis curves medially, where it
joins to the pubis of the opposite hip bone at a specialized joint called the pubic symphysis.

When you place your hands on your waist, you can feel the arching, superior margin of the ilium along your waistline
(see Figure 8.13). This curved, superior margin of the ilium is the iliac crest. The rounded, anterior termination of the
iliac crest is the anterior superior iliac spine.
