If artery
walls were rigid and unable to expand and recoil, their resistance to blood flow would greatly increase and blood pressure
would rise to even higher levels, which would in turn require the heart to pump harder to increase the volume of blood
expelled by each pump (the stroke volume) and maintain adequate pressure and flow. Artery walls would have to become
even thicker in response to this increased pressure. The elastic recoil of the vascular wall helps to maintain the pressure
gradient that drives the blood through the arterial system. An elastic artery is also known as a conducting artery, because the
large diameter of the lumen enables it to accept a large volume of blood from the heart and conduct it to smaller branches.
