Thus, fertilization can still occur if intercourse takes place a few days
before ovulation. In comparison, an oocyte can survive independently for only approximately 24 hours following ovulation.
 Intercourse more than a day after ovulation will therefore usually not result in fertilization.

 During the journey, fluids in the female reproductive tract prepare the sperm for fertilization through a process called
capacitation, or priming. The fluids improve the motility of the spermatozoa. They also deplete cholesterol molecules
embedded in the membrane of the head of the sperm, thinning the membrane in such a way that will help facilitate the
release of the lysosomal (digestive) enzymes needed for the sperm to penetrate the oocyte’s exterior once contact is made.
 Sperm must undergo the process of capacitation in order to have the “capacity” to fertilize an oocyte. If they reach the
oocyte before capacitation is complete, they will be unable to penetrate the oocyte’s thick outer layer of cells.
