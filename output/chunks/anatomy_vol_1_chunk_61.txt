One response to cold is shivering, which is
random muscle movement that generates heat. Another response is increased breakdown of stored energy to generate heat.
 When that energy reserve is depleted, however, and the core temperature begins to drop significantly, red blood cells will
lose their ability to give up oxygen, denying the brain of this critical component of ATP production. This lack of oxygen
can cause confusion, lethargy, and eventually loss of consciousness and death. The body responds to cold by reducing blood
circulation to the extremities, the hands and feet, in order to prevent blood from cooling there and so that the bodyâ€™s core can
stay warm. Even when core body temperature remains stable, however, tissues exposed to severe cold, especially the fingers
and toes, can develop frostbite when blood flow to the extremities has been much reduced.
