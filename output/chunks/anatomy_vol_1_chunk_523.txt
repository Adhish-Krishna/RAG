Acne

Acne is a skin disturbance that typically occurs on areas of the skin that are rich in sebaceous glands (face and back).
 It is most common along with the onset of puberty due to associated hormonal changes, but can also occur in infants
and continue into adulthood. Hormones, such as androgens, stimulate the release of sebum. An overproduction and
accumulation of sebum along with keratin can block hair follicles. This plug is initially white. The sebum, when oxidized by
exposure to air, turns black. Acne results from infection by acne-causing bacteria (Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus),
which can lead to redness and potential scarring due to the natural wound healing process (Figure 5.22).

inflammation of the skin.
