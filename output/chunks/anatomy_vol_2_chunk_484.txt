The diaphragm plays a role in Kehrâ€™s sign because the spleen is just inferior to the diaphragm in the upper-
left quadrant of the abdominopelvic cavity. When the spleen ruptures, blood spills into this region. The accumulating
hemorrhage then puts pressure on the diaphragm. The visceral sensation is actually in the diaphragm, so the referred
pain is in a region of the body that corresponds to the diaphragm, not the spleen.

Efferent Branch

The efferent branch of the visceral reflex arc begins with the projection from the central neuron along the preganglionic
fiber. This fiber then makes a synapse on the ganglionic neuron that projects to the target effector.

 The effector organs that are the targets of the autonomic system range from the iris and ciliary body of the eye to the
urinary bladder and reproductive organs. The thoracolumbar output, through the various sympathetic ganglia, reaches all of
these organs. The cranial component of the parasympathetic system projects from the eye to part of the intestines.
