The direction of the muscle fibers and fascicles are used to
describe muscles relative to the midline, such as the rectus (straight) abdominis, or the oblique (at an angle) muscles of the
abdomen.

 Some muscle names indicate the number of muscles in a group. One example of this is the quadriceps, a group of
four muscles located on the anterior (front) thigh. Other muscle names can provide information as to how many origins a
particular muscle has, such as the biceps brachii. The prefix bi indicates that the muscle has two origins and tri indicates
three origins.

 The location of a muscleâ€™s attachment can also appear in its name. When the name of a muscle is based on the
attachments, the origin is always named first. For instance, the sternocleidomastoid muscle of the neck has a dual origin
on the sternum (sterno) and clavicle (cleido), and it inserts on the mastoid process of the temporal bone.
