The descending aorta carries partially oxygenated and partially deoxygenated blood into the lower regions of the
body. It eventually passes into the umbilical arteries through branches of the internal iliac arteries. The deoxygenated blood
collects waste as it circulates through the fetal body and returns to the umbilical cord. Thus, the two umbilical arteries carry
blood low in oxygen and high in carbon dioxide and fetal wastes. This blood is filtered through the placenta, where wastes
diffuse into the maternal circulation. Oxygen and nutrients from the mother diffuse into the placenta and from there into the
etal blood, and the process repeats.

 The ductus

the aorta with the
