During infancy,
gastric glands also produce rennin, an enzyme that helps digest milk protein.

1046 CHAPTER 23 | THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM

 Its numerous digestive functions notwithstanding, there is only one stomach function necessary to life: the production
of intrinsic factor. The intestinal absorption of vitamin B12, which is necessary for both the production of mature red blood
cells and normal neurological functioning, cannot occur without intrinsic factor. People who undergo total gastrectomy
(stomach removal)—for life-threatening stomach cancer, for example—can survive with minimal digestive dysfunction if
they receive vitamin B12 injections.

 The contents of the stomach are completely emptied into the duodenum within 2 to 4 hours after you eat a meal.
 Different types of food take different amounts of time to process. Foods heavy in carbohydrates empty fastest, followed by
high-protein foods. Meals with a high triglyceride content remain in the stomach the longest. Since enzymes in the small
intestine digest fats slowly, food can stay in the stomach for 6 hours or longer when the duodenum is processing fatty chyme.
