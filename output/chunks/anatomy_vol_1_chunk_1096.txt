10.9 | Development and Regeneration of Muscle Tissue

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Describe the function of satellite cells
¢ Define fibrosis
¢ Explain which muscle has the greatest regeneration ability

Most muscle tissue of the body arises from embryonic mesoderm. Paraxial mesodermal cells adjacent to the neural tube
form blocks of cells called somites. Skeletal muscles, excluding those of the head and limbs, develop from mesodermal
somites, whereas skeletal muscle in the head and limbs develop from general mesoderm. Somites give rise to myoblasts. A
myoblast is a muscle-forming stem cell that migrates to different regions in the body and then fuse(s) to form a syncytium,
or myotube. As a myotube is formed from many different myoblast cells, it contains many nuclei, but has a continuous
cytoplasm. This is why skeletal muscle cells are multinucleate, as the nucleus of each contributing myoblast remains intact
in the mature skeletal muscle cell.
