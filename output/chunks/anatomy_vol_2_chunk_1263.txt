It fuses with the
external and internal jugular veins from the head and neck to form the brachiocephalic vein. Each vertebral vein also
flows into the brachiocephalic vein close to this fusion. These veins arise from the base of the brain and the cervical region

of the spinal cord, and flow largely through the intervertebral foramina in the cervical vertebrae. They are the counterparts
of the vertebral arteries. Each internal thoracic vein, also known as an internal mammary vein, drains the anterior surface
of the chest wall and flows into the brachiocephalic vein.

 The remainder of the blood supply from the thorax drains into the azygos vein. Each intercostal vein drains muscles
of the thoracic wall, each esophageal vein delivers blood from the inferior portions of the esophagus, each bronchial vein
drains the systemic circulation from the lungs, and several smaller veins drain the mediastinal region.
