The most broadly
accepted theory for this phenomenon is that the visceral sensory fibers enter into the same level of the spinal cord as the
somatosensory fibers of the referred pain location. By this explanation, the visceral sensory fibers from the mediastinal
region, where the heart is located, would enter the spinal cord at the same level as the spinal nerves from the shoulder and
arm, so the brain misinterprets the sensations from the mediastinal region as being from the axillary and brachial regions.
 Projections from the medial and inferior divisions of the cervical ganglia do enter the spinal cord at the middle to lower
cervical levels, which is where the somatosensory fibers enter.
