An overall loss of strength,
without laterality, could indicate a global problem with the motor system. Diseases that result in UMN lesions include
cerebral palsy or MS, or it may be the result of a stroke. A sign of UMN lesion is a negative result in the subtest for pronator
drift. The patient is asked to extend both arms in front of the body with the palms facing up. While keeping the eyes closed,
if the patient unconsciously allows one or the other arm to slowly relax, toward the pronated position, this could indicate a
failure of the motor system to maintain the supinated position.

 Reflexes

Reflexes combine the spinal sensory and motor components with a sensory input that directly generates a motor response.
 The reflexes that are tested in the neurological exam are classified into two groups. A deep tendon reflex is commonly
known as a stretch reflex, and is elicited by a strong tap to a tendon, such as in the knee-jerk reflex.
