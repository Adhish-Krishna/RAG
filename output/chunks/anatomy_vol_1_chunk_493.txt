¢ Describe the structure and function of hair and nails
¢ Describe the structure and function of sweat glands and sebaceous glands

Accessory structures of the skin include hair, nails, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands. These structures embryologically
originate from the epidermis and can extend down through the dermis into the hypodermis.

 Hair

Hair is a keratinous filament growing out of the epidermis. It is primarily made of dead, keratinized cells. Strands of hair
originate in an epidermal penetration of the dermis called the hair follicle. The hair shaft is the part of the hair not anchored
to the follicle, and much of this is exposed at the skin’s surface. The rest of the hair, which is anchored in the follicle, lies
below the surface of the skin and is referred to as the hair root. The hair root ends deep in the dermis at the hair bulb, and
includes a layer of mitotically active basal cells called the hair matrix.
