The ductless endocrine glands are not to be confused with the body’s exocrine system, whose glands release their
secretions through ducts. Examples of exocrine glands include the sebaceous and sweat glands of the skin. As just noted,
the pancreas also has an exocrine function: most of its cells secrete pancreatic juice through the pancreatic and accessory
ducts to the lumen of the small intestine.

Other Types of Chemical Signaling

In endocrine signaling, hormones secreted into the extracellular fluid diffuse into the blood or lymph, and can then travel
great distances throughout the body. In contrast, autocrine signaling takes place within the same cell. An autocrine (auto-
= “self”) is a chemical that elicits a response in the same cell that secreted it. Interleukin-1, or IL-1, is a signaling molecule
that plays an important role in inflammatory response. The cells that secrete IL-1 have receptors on their cell surface that
bind these molecules, resulting in autocrine signaling.
