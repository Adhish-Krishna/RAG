There are significant connections between this area, the
solitary nucleus, and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. These autonomic system and nuclei connections are
associated with the symptoms of motion sickness.

 Motion sickness is the result of conflicting information from the visual and vestibular systems. If motion is
perceived by the visual system without the complementary vestibular stimuli, or through vestibular stimuli without
visual confirmation, the brain stimulates emesis and the associated symptoms. The area postrema, by itself, appears to
be able to stimulate emesis in response to toxins in the blood, but it is also connected to the autonomic system and can
trigger a similar response to motion.

 Autonomic drugs are used to combat motion sickness. Though it is often described as a dangerous and deadly
drug, scopolamine is used to treat motion sickness. A popular treatment for motion sickness is the transdermal
scopolamine patch. Scopolamine is one of the substances derived from the Atropa genus along with atropine.
