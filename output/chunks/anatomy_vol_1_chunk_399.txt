Pseudostratified columnar epithelium is a type of epithelium that appears to be stratified but instead consists of a
single layer of irregularly shaped and differently sized columnar cells. In pseudostratified epithelium, nuclei of neighboring
cells appear at different levels rather than clustered in the basal end. The arrangement gives the appearance of stratification;
but in fact all the cells are in contact with the basal lamina, although some do not reach the apical surface. Pseudostratified
columnar epithelium is found in the respiratory tract, where some of these cells have cilia.

 Both simple and pseudostratified columnar epithelia are heterogeneous epithelia because they include additional types
of cells interspersed among the epithelial cells. For example, a goblet cell is a mucous-secreting unicellular “gland”
interspersed between the columnar epithelial cells of mucous membranes (Figure 4.7).
