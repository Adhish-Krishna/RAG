However, the tendon of the oblique muscles threads through a pulley-like
piece of cartilage known as the trochlea. The tendon inserts obliquely into the superior surface of the eye. The angle of the
tendon through the trochlea means that contraction of the superior oblique rotates the eye medially. The inferior oblique
muscle originates from the floor of the orbit and inserts into the inferolateral surface of the eye. When it contracts, it laterally
rotates the eye, in opposition to the superior oblique. Rotation of the eye by the two oblique muscles is necessary because
the eye is not perfectly aligned on the sagittal plane. When the eye looks up or down, the eye must also rotate slightly to
compensate for the superior rectus pulling at approximately a 20-degree angle, rather than straight up. The same is true for
the inferior rectus, which is compensated by contraction of the inferior oblique. A seventh muscle in the orbit is the levator
palpebrae superioris, which is responsible for elevating and retracting the upper eyelid, a movement that usually occurs in
concert with elevation of the eye by the superior rectus (see Figure 14.13).
