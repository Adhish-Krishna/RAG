 Obesity is defined by the body mass index (BMI), which is a measure of an individualâ€™s weight-to-height ratio.

 The normal, or healthy, BMI range is between 18 and 24.9 kg/m?. Overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/

m?, and obesity is considered to be a BMI greater than 30 kg/m?. Obesity can arise from a number of factors, including
overeating, poor diet, sedentary lifestyle, limited sleep, genetic factors, and even diseases or drugs. Severe obesity
(morbid obesity) or long-term obesity can result in serious medical conditions, including coronary heart disease; type
2 diabetes; endometrial, breast, or colon cancer; hypertension (high blood pressure); dyslipidemia (high cholesterol or
elevated triglycerides); stroke; liver disease; gall bladder disease; sleep apnea or respiratory diseases; osteoarthritis;
and infertility.
