This may be viewed as a largely protective function against dramatic fluctuations in blood
pressure and blood flow to maintain homeostasis. If perfusion of an organ is too low (ischemia), the tissue will experience
low levels of oxygen (hypoxia). In contrast, excessive perfusion could damage the organ’s smaller and more fragile vessels.
 The myogenic response is a localized process that serves to stabilize blood flow in the capillary network that follows that
arteriole.

 When blood flow is low, the vessel’s smooth muscle will be only minimally stretched. In response, it relaxes, allowing
the vessel to dilate and thereby increase the movement of blood into the tissue. When blood flow is too high, the smooth
muscle will contract in response to the increased stretch, prompting vasoconstriction that reduces blood flow.

 Figure 20.20 summarizes the effects of nervous, endocrine, and local controls on arterioles.

Neural Sympathetic stimulation Arterioles within integument, Arterioles within heart; skeletal

membrane; skeletal muscle (at high levels
levels); varied in veins and venules

no known innervation for most
other arterioles or veins

Endocrine Epinephrine Similar to sympathetic stimulation Similar to sympathetic stimulation
for extended flight-or-fight for extended fight-or-flight
responses; at high levels, binds to responses; at low to moderate
specialized alpha (a) receptors levels, binds to specialized

beta (p) receptors
