The pelvic floor muscles support the pelvic organs, resist intra-abdominal
pressure, and work as sphincters for the urethra, rectum, and vagina.

 The perineum is the diamond-shaped space between the pubic symphysis (anteriorly), the coccyx (posteriorly),
and the ischial tuberosities (laterally), lying just inferior to the pelvic diaphragm (levator ani and coccygeus). Divided
transversely into triangles, the anterior is the urogenital triangle, which includes the external genitals. The posterior is
the anal triangle, which contains the anus (Figure 11.20). The perineum is also divided into superficial and deep layers
with some of the muscles common to men and women (Figure 11.21). Women also have the compressor urethrae and the
sphincter urethrovaginalis, which function to close the vagina. In men, there is the deep transverse perineal muscle that
plays a role in ejaculation.
