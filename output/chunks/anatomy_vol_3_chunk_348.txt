Similarly, when a person exercises, muscles use ATP faster

than oxygen can be delivered to them. They depend on glycolysis and lactic acid

Aerobic Respiration

production for rapid ATP production.

 In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate can enter the Krebs cycle where additional energy is extracted as electrons are

transferred from the pyruvate to the receptors NAD", GDP, and FAD, with carbon dioxide being a “waste product” (Figure

24.6). The NADH and FADH? pass electrons on to the electron transport chain, wl

hich uses the transferred energy to produce

ATP. As the terminal step in the electron transport chain, oxygen is the terminal electron acceptor and creates water inside

the mitochondria.
