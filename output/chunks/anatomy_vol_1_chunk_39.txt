Like anatomists, physiologists typically specialize in a particular branch of physiology. For example, neurophysiology
is the study of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves and how these work together to perform functions as complex and diverse
as vision, movement, and thinking. Physiologists may work from the organ level (exploring, for example, what different
parts of the brain do) to the molecular level (such as exploring how an electrochemical signal travels along nerves).

 Form is closely related to function in all living things. For example, the thin flap of your eyelid can snap down to
clear away dust particles and almost instantaneously slide back up to allow you to see again. At the microscopic level, the
arrangement and function of the nerves and muscles that serve the eyelid allow for its quick action and retreat. At a smaller
level of analysis, the function of these nerves and muscles likewise relies on the interactions of specific molecules and ions.
