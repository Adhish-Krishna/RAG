Another subtest assesses the fluency and coherency of language by having
the patient generate descriptions of objects or scenes depicted in drawings, and by reciting sentences or explaining a written
passage. Language, however, is important in so many ways in the neurological exam. The patient needs to know what to do,
whether it is as simple as explaining how the knee-jerk reflex is going to be performed, or asking a question such as “What
is your name?” Often, language deficits can be determined without specific subtests; if a person cannot reply to a question
properly, there may be a problem with the reception of language.

 An important example of multimodal integrative areas is associated with language function (Figure 16.6). Adjacent
to the auditory association cortex, at the end of the lateral sulcus just anterior to the visual cortex, is Wernicke’s area. In
the lateral aspect of the frontal lobe, just anterior to the region of the motor cortex associated with the head and neck, is
Broca’s area.
