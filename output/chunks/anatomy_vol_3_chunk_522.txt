If less ADH is secreted, fewer aquaporin channels are inserted and less water is recovered,
resulting in dilute urine. By altering the number of aquaporin channels, the volume of water recovered or lost is altered.
 This, in turn, regulates the blood osmolarity, blood pressure, and osmolarity of the urine.

 As Na‚Äù is pumped from the forming urine, water is passively recaptured for the circulation; this preservation of
vascular volume is critically important for the maintenance of a normal blood pressure. Aldosterone is secreted by the
adrenal cortex in response to angiotensin II stimulation. As an extremely potent vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II functions
immediately to increase blood pressure. By also stimulating aldosterone production, it provides a longer-lasting mechanism
to support blood pressure by maintaining vascular volume (water recovery).

 In addition to receptors for ADH, principal cells have receptors for the steroid hormone aldosterone. While ADH is

primarily involved in the regulation of water recovery, aldosterone regulates Na* recovery.
