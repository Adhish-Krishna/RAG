There even are triple covalent bonds, where three atoms are
shared.

 (a) A single covalent bond: hydrogen gas (H—H). Two atoms of hydrogen each share their solitary electron in a single covalent bond.
 +. re) $2
ORO

(b) A double covalent bond: oxygen gas (O=0). An atom of oxygen has six electrons in its valence shell; thus, two more would
make it stable. Two atoms of oxygen achieve stability by sharing two pairs of electrons in a double covalent bond,

Oe):

Molecule of oxygen gas (Oz)

(c) Two double covalent bonds: carbon dioxide (O—C=O). An atom of carbon has four electrons in its valence shell; thus, four more
would make it stable. An atom of carbon and two atoms of oxygen achieve stability by sharing two electron pairs each, in two
double covalent bonds.
