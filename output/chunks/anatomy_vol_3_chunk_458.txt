The bladder is a highly distensible organ comprised of irregular crisscrossing bands of smooth muscle collectively
called the detrusor muscle. The interior surface is made of transitional cellular epithelium that is structurally suited for the
large volume fluctuations of the bladder. When empty, it resembles columnar epithelia, but when stretched, it “transitions”
(hence the name) to a squamous appearance (see Figure 25.4). Volumes in adults can range from nearly zero to 500-600
mL.
The detrusor muscle contracts with significant force in the young. The bladder’s strength diminishes with age, but
voluntary contractions of abdominal skeletal muscles can increase intra-abdominal pressure to promote more forceful
bladder emptying. Such voluntary contraction is also used in forceful defecation and childbirth.

 Micturition Reflex

Micturition is a less-often used, but proper term for urination or voiding. It results from an interplay of involuntary and
voluntary actions by the internal and external urethral sphincters.
