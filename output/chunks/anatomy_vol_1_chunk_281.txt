Cells of the stomach and pancreas produce and secrete digestive enzymes through
exocytosis (Figure 3.12). Endocrine cells produce and secrete hormones that are sent throughout the body, and certain
immune cells produce and secrete large amounts of histamine, a chemical important for immune responses.

Figure 3.11 Exocytosis Exocytosis is much like endocytosis in reverse. Material destined for export is packaged into
a vesicle inside the cell. The membrane of the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane, and the contents are released

into the extracellular space.

Figure 3.12 Pancreatic Cells' Enzyme Products The pancreatic acinar cells produce and secrete many enzymes
that digest food. The tiny black granules in this electron micrograph are secretory vesicles filled with enzymes that will
be exported from the cells via exocytosis. LM x 2900. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan
