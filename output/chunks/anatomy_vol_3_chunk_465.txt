Upper portions of the kidneys are somewhat protected by the eleventh and twelfth ribs (Figure 25.7). Each kidney weighs
about 125-175 g in males and 115-155 g in females. They are about 11-14 cm in length, 6 cm wide, and 4 cm thick, and
are directly covered by a fibrous capsule composed of dense, irregular connective tissue that helps to hold their shape and
protect them. This capsule is covered by a shock-absorbing layer of adipose tissue called the renal fat pad, which in turn is
encompassed by a tough renal fascia. The fascia and, to a lesser extent, the overlying peritoneum serve to firmly anchor the
kidneys to the posterior abdominal wall in a retroperitoneal position.
