35 If diabetes is
uncontrolled, the glucose in the blood is not being taken up and processed by the cells. Although blood glucose levels are high,
there is no glucose available to the cells to be converted into energy. Because glucose is lacking, the body turns to other energy
sources, including ketones. A side effect of using ketones as fuel is a sweet alcohol smell on the breath. 36 Amino acids are not
stored in the body. The individual amino acids are broken down into pyruvate, acetyl CoA, or intermediates of the Krebs cycle, and
used for energy or for lipogenesis reactions to be stored as fats. 37 Trypsin and chymotrypsin are released as inactive proenzymes.
 They are only activated in the small intestine, where they act upon ingested proteins in the food. This helps avoid unintended
breakdown of the pancreas or small intestine. 38 Insulin stimulates the uptake of glucose into the cells. In diabetes, the insulin
does not function properly; therefore, the blood glucose is unable to be transported across the cell membrane for processing.
