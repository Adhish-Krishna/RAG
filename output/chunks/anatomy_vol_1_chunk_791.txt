This mobility is important during power gripping with the hand (Figure
8.10). The anterior movement of these bones, particularly the fifth metacarpal bone, increases the strength of contact for the
medial hand during gripping actions.

Figure 8.10 Hand During Gripping During tight gripping—compare (b) to (a)—the fourth and, particularly, the fifth
metatarsal bones are pulled anteriorly. This increases the contact between the object and the medial side of the hand,
thus improving the firmness of the grip.

 Phalanx Bones

The fingers and thumb contain 14 bones, each of which is called a phalanx bone (plural = phalanges), named after the
ancient Greek phalanx (a rectangular block of soldiers). The thumb ( pollex) is digit number 1 and has two phalanges, a
proximal phalanx, and a distal phalanx bone (see Figure 8.7).
