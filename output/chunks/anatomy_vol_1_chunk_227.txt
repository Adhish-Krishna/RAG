sugar, and a nitrogen-containing base. (b) The nitrogen-containing bases of nucleotides. (c) The two pentose sugars

Nucleic Acids

The nucleic acids differ in their type of pentose sugar. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is nucleotide that stores genetic
information. DNA contains deoxyribose (so-called because it has one less atom of oxygen than ribose) plus one phosphate
group and one nitrogen-containing base.
