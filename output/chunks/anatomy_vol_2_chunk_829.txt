This is because
hemoglobin is a pigment that changes color, depending upon the degree of oxygen saturation.

 Blood is viscous and somewhat sticky to the touch. It has a viscosity approximately five times greater than water.
 Viscosity is a measure of a fluid’s thickness or resistance to flow, and is influenced by the presence of the plasma proteins
and formed elements within the blood. The viscosity of blood has a dramatic impact on blood pressure and flow. Consider
the difference in flow between water and honey. The more viscous honey would demonstrate a greater resistance to flow
than the less viscous water. The same principle applies to blood.

 The normal temperature of blood is slightly higher than normal body temperature—about 38 °C (or 100.4 °F),
compared to 37 °C (or 98.6 °F) for an internal body temperature reading, although daily variations of 0.5 °C are normal.
