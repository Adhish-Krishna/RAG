In addition,
the clavicle of each pectoral girdle is anchored to the axial skeleton by a single, highly mobile joint. This allows for the
extensive mobility of the entire pectoral girdle, which in turn enhances movements of the shoulder and upper limb.

 Clavicle

The clavicle is the only long bone that lies in a horizontal position in the body (see Figure 8.3). The clavicle has several
important functions. First, anchored by muscles from above, it serves as a strut that extends laterally to support the scapula.
 This in turn holds the shoulder joint superiorly and laterally from the body trunk, allowing for maximal freedom of motion
for the upper limb. The clavicle also transmits forces acting on the upper limb to the sternum and axial skeleton. Finally, it
serves to protect the underlying nerves and blood vessels as they pass between the trunk of the body and the upper limb.
