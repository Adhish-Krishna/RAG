There is also a region of the peripheral nervous system
that is called the enteric nervous system that is responsible for a specific set of the functions within the realm of autonomic
control related to gastrointestinal functions.

 Basic Functions

The nervous system is involved in receiving information about the environment around us (sensation) and generating
responses to that information (motor responses). The nervous system can be divided into regions that are responsible
for sensation (sensory functions) and for the response (motor functions). But there is a third function that needs to be
included. Sensory input needs to be integrated with other sensations, as well as with memories, emotional state, or learning
(cognition). Some regions of the nervous system are termed integration or association areas. The process of integration
combines sensory perceptions and higher cognitive functions such as memories, learning, and emotion to produce a
response.
