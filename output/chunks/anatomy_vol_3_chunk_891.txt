Females, however, can be genotypically normal, a carrier who is phenotypically normal, or affected with the disease. A
daughter can inherit the gene for an X-linked recessive illness when her mother is a carrier or affected, or her father is
affected. The daughter will be affected by the disease only if she inherits an X-linked recessive gene from both parents. As
you can imagine, X-linked recessive disorders affect many more males than females. For example, color blindness affects
at least 1 in 20 males, but only about 1 in 400 females.

Figure 28.29 X-Linked Recessive Inheritance Given two parents in which the father is normal and the mother is a
carrier of an X-linked recessive disorder, a son would have a 50 percent probability of being affected with the disorder,
whereas daughters would either be carriers or entirely unaffected.
