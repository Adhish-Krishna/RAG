Less dramatic than the vasoconstriction seen in smaller arteries and arterioles, venoconstriction may
be likened to a “stiffening” of the vessel wall. This increases pressure on the blood within the veins, speeding its return to the
heart. As you will note in Figure 20.9, approximately 21 percent of the venous blood is located in venous networks within
the liver, bone marrow, and integument. This volume of blood is referred to as venous reserve. Through venoconstriction,
this “reserve” volume of blood can get back to the heart more quickly for redistribution to other parts of the circulation.
