INTERACTIVE LINK QUESTIONS

1. Watch this video  (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/
neuroexam) that provides a demonstration of the
neurological exam—a series of tests that can be performed
rapidly when a patient is initially brought into an emergency
department. The exam can be repeated on a regular basis to
keep a record of how and if neurological function changes
over time. In what order were the sections of the
neurological exam tested in this video, and which section
seemed to be left out?

2. Watch this video  (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/
neuroexam2) for an introduction to the neurological exam.
 Studying the neurological exam can give insight into how
structure and function in the nervous system are
interdependent. This is a tool both in the clinic and in the
classroom, but for different reasons. In the clinic, this is a
powerful but simple tool to assess a patient’s neurological
function.
