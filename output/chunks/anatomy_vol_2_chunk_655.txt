By pushing down on the arms in this position,
the examiner can check for the rebound response, which is when the arms are automatically brought back to the extended
position. The extension of the arms is an ongoing motor process, and the tap or push on the arms presents a change in
the proprioceptive feedback. The cerebellum compares the cerebral motor command with the proprioceptive feedback and
adjusts the descending input to correct. The red nucleus would send an additional signal to the LMN for the arm to increase
contraction momentarily to overcome the change and regain the original position.

 The check reflex depends on cerebellar input to keep increased contraction from continuing after the removal of
resistance. The patient flexes the elbow against resistance from the examiner to extend the elbow. When the examiner
releases the arm, the patient should be able to stop the increased contraction and keep the arm from moving. A similar
response would be seen if you try to pick up a coffee mug that you believe to be full but turns out to be empty.
