The first two are named the lateral ventricles and are deep within the cerebrum. These ventricles are
connected to the third ventricle by two openings called the interventricular foramina. The third ventricle is the space
between the left and right sides of the diencephalon, which opens into the cerebral aqueduct that passes through the
midbrain. The aqueduct opens into the fourth ventricle, which is the space between the cerebellum and the pons and upper
medulla (Figure 13.18).

Figure 13.18 Cerebrospinal Fluid Circulation The choroid plexus in the four ventricles produce CSF, which is
circulated through the ventricular system and then enters the subarachnoid space through the median and lateral
apertures.
