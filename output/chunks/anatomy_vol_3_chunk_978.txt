58 The first sternocostal joint is a synchondrosis type of cartilaginous joint in which
hyaline cartilage unites the first rib to the manubrium of the sternum. This forms an immobile (synarthrosis) type of joint. The
pubic symphysis is a slightly mobile (amphiarthrosis) cartilaginous joint, where the pubic portions of the right and left hip bones
are united by fibrocartilage, thus forming a symphysis. 59 All synovial joints have a joint cavity filled with synovial fluid that is
the site at which the bones of the joint articulate with each other. The articulating surfaces of the bones are covered by articular
cartilage, a thin layer of hyaline cartilage. The walls of the joint cavity are formed by the connective tissue of the articular capsule.
 The synovial membrane lines the interior surface of the joint cavity and secretes the synovial fluid. Synovial joints are directly
supported by ligaments, which span between the bones of the joint. These may be located outside of the articular capsule (extrinsic
ligaments), incorporated or fused to the wall of the articular capsule (intrinsic ligaments), or found inside of the articular capsule
(intracapsular ligaments).
