If the sensory stimulus is received
by a specialized sensory receptor cell, the graded potential is called a receptor potential. Graded potentials produced by
interactions between neurons at synapses are called postsynaptic potentials (PSPs). A depolarizing graded potential at a
synapse is called an excitatory PSP, and a hyperpolarizing graded potential at a synapse is called an inhibitory PSP.

 Synapses are the contacts between neurons, which can either be chemical or electrical in nature. Chemical synapses
are far more common. At a chemical synapse, neurotransmitter is released from the presynaptic element and diffuses across
the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitter binds to a receptor protein and causes a change in the postsynaptic membrane (the
PSP). The neurotransmitter must be inactivated or removed from the synaptic cleft so that the stimulus is limited in time.

 The particular characteristics of a synapse vary based on the neurotransmitter system produced by that neuron. The
cholinergic system is found at the neuromuscular junction and in certain places within the nervous system.
