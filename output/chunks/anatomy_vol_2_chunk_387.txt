CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 589

 The cortex has been described as having specific regions that are responsible for processing specific information;
there is the visual cortex, somatosensory cortex, gustatory cortex, etc. However, our experience of these senses is not
divided. Instead, we experience what can be referred to as a seamless percept. Our perceptions of the various sensory
modalities—though distinct in their content—are integrated by the brain so that we experience the world as a continuous
whole.

 In the cerebral cortex, sensory processing begins at the primary sensory cortex, then proceeds to an association area,
and finally, into a multimodal integration area.
