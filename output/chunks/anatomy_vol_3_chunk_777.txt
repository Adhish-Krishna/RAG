To reach the oocyte itself, the sperm must
penetrate the two protective layers. The sperm first burrow through the cells of the corona radiata. Then, upon contact with
the zona pellucida, the sperm bind to receptors in the zona pellucida. This initiates a process called the acrosomal reaction
in which the enzyme-filled “cap” of the sperm, called the acrosome, releases its stored digestive enzymes. These enzymes
clear a path through the zona pellucida that allows sperm to reach the oocyte. Finally, a single sperm makes contact with
sperm-binding receptors on the oocyte’s plasma membrane (Figure 28.2). The plasma membrane of that sperm then fuses
with the oocyte’s plasma membrane, and the head and mid-piece of the “winning” sperm enter the oocyte interior.

 How do sperm penetrate the corona radiata? Some sperm undergo a spontaneous acrosomal reaction, which is an
acrosomal reaction not triggered by contact with the zona pellucida.
