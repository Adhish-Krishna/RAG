Chapter 22

1 Inflammation and the production of a thick mucus; constriction of the airway muscles, or bronchospasm; and an increased
sensitivity to allergens. 2 Patients with respiratory ailments (such as asthma, emphysema, COPD, etc.) have issues with airway
resistance and/or lung compliance. Both of these factors can interfere with the patient’s ability to move air effectively. A spirometry
test can determine how much air the patient can move into and out of the lungs. If the air volumes are low, this can indicate that
the patient has a respiratory disease or that the treatment regimen may need to be adjusted. If the numbers are normal, the patient
does not have a significant respiratory disease or the treatment regimen is working as expected. 3 When oxygen binds to the
hemoglobin molecule, oxyhemoglobin is created, which has a red color to it. Hemoglobin that is not bound to oxygen tends to
be more of a blue—purple color.
