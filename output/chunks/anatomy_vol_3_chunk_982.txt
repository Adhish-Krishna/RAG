1 (a) Z-lines. (b) Sarcomeres. (c) This is the arrangement of the actin and myosin filaments in a sarcomere. (d) The alternating
strands of actin and myosin filaments. 2 (a) It is the number of skeletal muscle fibers supplied by a single motor neuron. (b)
A large motor unit has one neuron supplying many skeletal muscle fibers for gross movements, like the Temporalis muscle,
where 1000 fibers are supplied by one neuron. A small motor has one neuron supplying few skeletal muscle fibers for very
fine movements, like the extraocular eye muscles, where six fibers are supplied by one neuron. (c) To avoid prolongation of

muscle contraction. 3 (a) The T-tubules are inward extensions of the sarcolemma that trigger the release of Ca** from SR during

an Action Potential. (b) Ca** binds to tropomyosin, and this slides the tropomyosin rods away from the binding sites.
