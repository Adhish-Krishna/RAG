Stretching of the ligaments that support the longitudinal arches can lead to pain. This can occur in overweight
individuals, with people who have jobs that involve standing for long periods of time (such as a waitress), or walking
or running long distances. If stretching of the ligaments is prolonged, excessive, or repeated, it can result in a gradual
lengthening of the supporting ligaments, with subsequent depression or collapse of the longitudinal arches, particularly on
the medial side of the foot. This condition is called pes planus (“flat foot” or “fallen arches”).
