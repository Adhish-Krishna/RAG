All of these actions promote loss of fluid from the body, so blood volume and blood pressure drop.

 Autoregulation of Perfusion

As the name would suggest, autoregulation mechanisms require neither specialized nervous stimulation nor endocrine
control. Rather, these are local, self-regulatory mechanisms that allow each region of tissue to adjust its blood flowâ€”and
thus its perfusion. These local mechanisms include chemical signals and myogenic controls.

 Chemical Signals Involved in Autoregulation

Chemical signals work at the level of the precapillary sphincters to trigger either constriction or relaxation. As you know,
opening a precapillary sphincter allows blood to flow into that particular capillary, whereas constricting a precapillary
sphincter temporarily shuts off blood flow to that region. The factors involved in regulating the precapillary sphincters
include the following:
* Opening of the sphincter is triggered in response to decreased oxygen concentrations; increased carbon dioxide
concentrations; increasing levels of lactic acid or other byproducts of cellular metabolism; increasing concentrations

of potassium ions or hydrogen ions (falling pH); inflammatory chemicals such as histamines; and increased body
temperature.
