Bronchial Tree

The trachea branches into the right and left primary bronchi at the carina. These bronchi are also lined by pseudostratified
ciliated columnar epithelium containing mucus-producing goblet cells (Figure 22.9b). The carina is a raised structure that
contains specialized nervous tissue that induces violent coughing if a foreign body, such as food, is present. Rings of
cartilage, similar to those of the trachea, support the structure of the bronchi and prevent their collapse. The primary bronchi
enter the lungs at the hilum, a concave region where blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves also enter the lungs.
 The bronchi continue to branch into bronchial a tree. A bronchial tree (or respiratory tree) is the collective term used for
these multiple-branched bronchi. The main function of the bronchi, like other conducting zone structures, is to provide a
passageway for air to move into and out of each lung.
