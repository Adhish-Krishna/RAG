With these injuries, the immediate concern is possible compression of the artery to
the forearm due to swelling of the surrounding tissues. If compression occurs, the resulting ischemia (lack of oxygen)
due to reduced blood flow can quickly produce irreparable damage to the forearm muscles. In addition, four major
nerves for shoulder and upper limb muscles are closely associated with different regions of the humerus, and thus,
humeral fractures may also damage these nerves.

 Another frequent injury following a fall onto an outstretched hand is a Colles fracture (“col-lees”) of the distal
radius (see Figure 8.11). This involves a complete transverse fracture across the distal radius that drives the separated
distal fragment of the radius posteriorly and superiorly. This injury results in a characteristic “dinner fork” bend of the
forearm just above the wrist due to the posterior displacement of the hand.
