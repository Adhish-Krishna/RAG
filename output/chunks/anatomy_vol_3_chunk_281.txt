CHAPTER 23 | THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM

* Mechanical digestion includes
chewing and swallowing

* Chemical digestion of
carbohydrates, fats

* Mechanical digestion includes
peristaltic mixing and propulsion
* Chemical digestion of
proteins, fats
* Absorption of lipid-soluble
substances such as alcohol
and aspirin

Esophagus

Liver

Gallbladder * Mechanical digestion includes

mixing and propulsion, primarily
by segmentation
* Chemical digestion of

carbohydrates, fats, polypeptides,
nucleic acids

Pylorus

Pancreas

* Absorption of peptides, amino
acids, glucose, fructose, fats,
water, minerals, and vitamins

* Mechanical digestion includes
segmental mixing and propulsion

* No chemical digestion (except
by bacteria)

* Absorption of ions, water,

minerals, vitamins, and organic
molecules

Rectum

Anal sphincter

small intestine.
