Over-salivation can occur, for example, if you are stimulated by the smell of food, but that food is not available for you
to eat. Drooling is an extreme instance of the overproduction of saliva. During times of stress, such as before speaking in
public, sympathetic stimulation takes over, reducing salivation and producing the symptom of dry mouth often associated
with anxiety. When you are dehydrated, salivation is reduced, causing the mouth to feel dry and prompting you to take
action to quench your thirst.

 Salivation can be stimulated by the sight, smell, and taste of food. It can even be stimulated by thinking about food.
 You might notice whether reading about food and salivation right now has had any effect on your production of saliva.

 How does the salivation process work while you are eating? Food contains chemicals that stimulate taste receptors
on the tongue, which send impulses to the superior and inferior salivatory nuclei in the brain stem.
