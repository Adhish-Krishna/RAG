The pericardial membrane that surrounds the
heart consists of three layers and the pericardial cavity. The heart wall also consists of three layers. The pericardial
membrane and the heart wall share the epicardium.

Heart: Cardiac Tamponade

If excess fluid builds within the pericardial space, it can lead to a condition called cardiac tamponade, or pericardial
tamponade. With each contraction of the heart, more fluid—in most instances, blood—accumulates within the
pericardial cavity. In order to fill with blood for the next contraction, the heart must relax. However, the excess fluid in
the pericardial cavity puts pressure on the heart and prevents full relaxation, so the chambers within the heart contain
slightly less blood as they begin each heart cycle. Over time, less and less blood is ejected from the heart. If the
fluid builds up slowly, as in hypothyroidism, the pericardial cavity may be able to expand gradually to accommodate
this extra volume.
