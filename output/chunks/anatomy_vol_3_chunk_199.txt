Between approximately age 6 and 12, these teeth are replaced by
32 permanent teeth. Moving from the center of the mouth toward the side, these are as follows (Figure 23.10):
 ¢ The eight incisors, four top and four bottom, are the sharp front teeth you use for biting into food.
 * The four cuspids (or canines) flank the incisors and have a pointed edge (cusp) to tear up food. These fang-like teeth
are superb for piercing tough or fleshy foods.
 * Posterior to the cuspids are the eight premolars (or bicuspids), which have an overall flatter shape with two rounded
cusps useful for mashing foods.
 ¢ The most posterior and largest are the 12 molars, which have several pointed cusps used to crush food so it is ready for
swallowing. The third members of each set of three molars, top and bottom, are commonly referred to as the wisdom
teeth, because their eruption is commonly delayed until early adulthood.
