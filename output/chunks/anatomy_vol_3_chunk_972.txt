4 The most
common cause of hip disability is osteoarthritis, a chronic disease in which the articular cartilage of the joint wears away, resulting
in severe hip pain and stiffness. 5 The immune system malfunctions and attacks healthy cells in the lining of your joints. This
causes inflammation and pain in the joints and surrounding tissues. 6 Dorsiflexion of the foot at the ankle decreases the angle
of the ankle joint, while plantar flexion increases the angle of the ankle joint. 7 The first motion is rotation (hinging) of the
mandible, but this only produces about 20 mm (0.78 in) of mouth opening. 8 The shoulder joint is a ball-and-socket joint that
allows for flexion-extension, abduction-adduction, medial rotation, lateral rotation, and circumduction of the humerus. 9 The
glenoid labrum is wedge-shaped in cross-section. This is important because it creates an elevated rim around the glenoid cavity,
which creates a deeper socket for the head of the humerus to fit into.
