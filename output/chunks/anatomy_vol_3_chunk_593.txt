In pulmonary edema resulting from heart failure, excessive leakage of water occurs because fluids get “backed
up” in the pulmonary capillaries of the lungs, when the left ventricle of the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood
into the systemic circulation. Because the left side of the heart is unable to pump out its normal volume of blood, the
blood in the pulmonary circulation gets “backed up,” starting with the left atrium, then into the pulmonary veins, and
then into pulmonary capillaries. The resulting increased hydrostatic pressure within pulmonary capillaries, as blood is
still coming in from the pulmonary arteries, causes fluid to be pushed out of them and into lung tissues.

 Other causes of edema include damage to blood vessels and/or lymphatic vessels, or a decrease in osmotic
pressure in chronic and severe liver disease, where the liver is unable to manufacture plasma proteins (Figure
26.9).
