Because of the random segregation of gametes, the laws of chance and probability come into play when predicting the
likelihood of a given phenotype. Consider a cross between an individual with two dominant alleles for a trait (AA) and an
individual with two recessive alleles for the same trait (aa). All of the parental gametes from the dominant individual would
be A, and all of the parental gametes from the recessive individual would be a (Figure 28.25). All of the offspring of that
second generation, inheriting one allele from each parent, would have the genotype Aa, and the probability of expressing
the phenotype of the dominant allele would be 4 out of 4, or 100 percent.

 This seems simple enough, but the inheritance pattern gets interesting when the second-generation Aa individuals are
crossed. In this generation, 50 percent of each parent’s gametes are A and the other 50 percent are a. By Mendel’s principle
of random segregation, the possible combinations of gametes that the offspring can receive are AA, Aa, aA (which is the
same as Aa), and aa.
