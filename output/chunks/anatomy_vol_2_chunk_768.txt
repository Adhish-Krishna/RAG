Other common signs of Cushing’s disease include the development of a
moon-shaped face, a buffalo hump on the back of the neck, rapid weight gain, and hair loss. Chronically elevated glucose
levels are also associated with an elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In addition to hyperglycemia, chronically
elevated glucocorticoids compromise immunity, resistance to infection, and memory, and can result in rapid weight gain
and hair loss.

 In contrast, the hyposecretion of corticosteroids can result in Addison’s disease, a rare disorder that causes low blood
glucose levels and low blood sodium levels. The signs and symptoms of Addison’s disease are vague and are typical of other
disorders as well, making diagnosis difficult. They may include general weakness, abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea,
vomiting, sweating, and cravings for salty food.
