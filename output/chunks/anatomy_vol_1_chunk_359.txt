Gi phase first phase of the cell cycle, after a new cell is born
G2 phase third phase of the cell cycle, after the DNA synthesis phase

Golgi apparatus cellular organelle formed by a series of flattened, membrane-bound sacs that functions in protein
modification, tagging, packaging, and transport

gene expression active interpretation of the information coded in a gene to produce a functional gene product
gene functional length of DNA that provides the genetic information necessary to build a protein

glycocalyx coating of sugar molecules that surrounds the cell membrane

glycoprotein protein that has one or more carbohydrates attached

helicase enzyme that functions to separate the two DNA strands of a double helix during DNA replication
histone family of proteins that associate with DNA in the nucleus to form chromatin

homologous describes two copies of the same chromosome (not identical), one inherited from each parent
hydrophilic describes a substance or structure attracted to water

hydrophobic describes a substance or structure repelled by water

hypertonic describes a solution concentration that is higher than a reference concentration

hypotonic describes a solution concentration that is lower than a reference concentration

integral protein membrane-associated protein that spans the entire width of the lipid bilayer

intermediate filament type of cytoskeletal filament made of keratin, characterized by an intermediate thickness, and
playing a role in resisting cellular tension

CHAPTER 3 | THE CELLULAR LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION

intracellular fluid (ICF) fluid in the cytosol of cells

intron non-coding regions of a pre-mRNA transcript that may be removed during splicing

isotonic describes a solution concentration that is the same as a reference concentration

kinetochore region of a centromere where microtubules attach to a pair of sister chromatids

ligand molecule that binds with specificity to a specific receptor molecule

lysosome membrane-bound cellular organelle originating from the Golgi apparatus and containing digestive enzymes

messenger RNA (mRNA) nucleotide molecule that serves as an intermediate in the genetic code between DNA and
protein

metaphase plate linear alignment of sister chromatids in the center of the cell, which takes place during metaphase

metaphase second stage of mitosis (and meiosis), characterized by the linear alignment of sister chromatids in the
center of the cell

microfilament the thinnest of the cytoskeletal filaments; composed of actin subunits that function in muscle
contraction and cellular structural support

microtubule the thickest of the cytoskeletal filaments, composed of tubulin subunits that function in cellular movement
and structural support

mitochondrion one of the cellular organelles bound by a double lipid bilayer that function primarily in the production
of cellular energy (ATP)

mitosis division of genetic material, during which the cell nucleus breaks down and two new, fully functional, nuclei
are formed

mitotic phase phase of the cell cycle in which a cell undergoes mitosis

mitotic spindle network of microtubules, originating from centrioles, that arranges and pulls apart chromosomes
during mitosis

multipotent describes the condition of being able to differentiate into different types of cells within a given cell lineage
or small number of lineages, such as a red blood cell or white blood cell

mutation change in the nucleotide sequence in a gene within a cell’s DNA

nuclear envelope membrane that surrounds the nucleus; consisting of a double lipid-bilayer

nuclear pore one of the small, protein-lined openings found scattered throughout the nuclear envelope
nucleolus small region of the nucleus that functions in ribosome synthesis

nucleosome unit of chromatin consisting of a DNA strand wrapped around histone proteins

nucleus cell’s central organelle; contains the cell’s DNA

oligopotent describes the condition of being more specialized than multipotency;
