Figure 17.4 Binding of Lipid-Soluble Hormones A steroid hormone directly initiates the production of proteins
within a target cell. Steroid hormones easily diffuse through the cell membrane. The hormone binds to its receptor in
the cytosol, forming a receptor—hormone complex. The receptor-hormone complex then enters the nucleus and binds
to the target gene on the DNA. Transcription of the gene creates a messenger RNA that is translated into the desired
protein within the cytoplasm.
