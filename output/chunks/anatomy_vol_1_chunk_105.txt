In the past, anatomy has primarily been studied via
observing injuries, and later by the dissection of anatomical structures of cadavers, but in the past century, computer-assisted
imaging techniques have allowed clinicians to look inside the living body. Human physiology is the scientific study of the
chemistry and physics of the structures of the body. Physiology explains how the structures of the body work together to
maintain life. It is difficult to study structure (anatomy) without knowledge of function (physiology). The two disciplines
are typically studied together because form and function are closely related in all living things.

 1.2 Structural Organization of the Human Body

Life processes of the human body are maintained at several levels of structural organization. These include the chemical,
cellular, tissue, organ, organ system, and the organism level. Higher levels of organization are built from lower levels.
 Therefore, molecules combine to form cells, cells combine to form tissues, tissues combine to form organs, organs combine
to form organ systems, and organ systems combine to form organisms.
