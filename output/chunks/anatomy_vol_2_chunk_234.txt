An arachnoid villus is
shown emerging into the dural sinus to allow CSF to filter back into the blood for drainage.

 Dura Mater

Like a thick cap covering the brain, the dura mater is a tough outer covering. The name comes from the Latin for “tough
mother” to represent its physically protective role. It encloses the entire CNS and the major blood vessels that enter the
cranium and vertebral cavity. It is directly attached to the inner surface of the bones of the cranium and to the very end of
the vertebral cavity.

 There are infoldings of the dura that fit into large crevasses of the brain. Two infoldings go through the midline
separations of the cerebrum and cerebellum; one forms a shelf-like tent between the occipital lobes of the cerebrum and the
cerebellum, and the other surrounds the pituitary gland.
