brain stem structures. The vestibular system enters the brain stem and influences activity in the cerebellum, spinal cord, and
cerebral cortex.

 The visual pathway segregates information from the two eyes so that one half of the visual field projects to the other
side of the brain. Within visual cortical areas, the perception of the stimuli and their location is passed along two streams,
one ventral and one dorsal. The ventral visual stream connects to structures in the temporal lobe that are important for long-
term memory formation. The dorsal visual stream interacts with the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe, and together
they can influence the activity in the frontal lobe to generate movements of the body in relation to visual information.

14.3 Motor Responses

The motor components of the somatic nervous system begin with the frontal lobe of the brain, where the prefrontal cortex
is responsible for higher functions such as working memory.
