1174 CHAPTER 26 | FLUID, ELECTROLYTE, AND ACID-BASE BALANCE

Homeostasis, or the maintenance of constant conditions in the body, is a fundamental property of all living things. In the
human body, the substances that participate in chemical reactions must remain within narrows ranges of concentration. Too
much or too little of a single substance can disrupt your bodily functions. Because metabolism relies on reactions that are all
interconnected, any disruption might affect multiple organs or even organ systems. Water is the most ubiquitous substance
in the chemical reactions of life. The interactions of various aqueous solutions—solutions in which water is the solvent—are
continuously monitored and adjusted by a large suite of interconnected feedback systems in your body.
