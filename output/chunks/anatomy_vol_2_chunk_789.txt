Here, you will learn about the hormone-producing activities of the heart, gastrointestinal
tract, kidneys, skeleton, adipose tissue, skin, and thymus.

 Heart

When the body experiences an increase in blood volume or pressure, the cells of the heartâ€™s atrial wall stretch. In response,
specialized cells in the wall of the atria produce and secrete the peptide hormone atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). ANP
signals the kidneys to reduce sodium reabsorption, thereby decreasing the amount of water reabsorbed from the urine filtrate
and reducing blood volume. Other actions of ANP include the inhibition of renin secretion and the initiation of the renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and vasodilation. Therefore, ANP aids in decreasing blood pressure, blood volume,
and blood sodium levels.

 Gastrointestinal Tract

The endocrine cells of the GI tract are located in the mucosa of the stomach and small intestine. Some of these hormones
are secreted in response to eating a meal and aid in digestion.
