In fact, it is the loss of ATP that results in the rigor mortis
observed soon after someone dies. With no further ATP production possible, there is no ATP available for myosin heads to
detach from the actin-binding sites, so the cross-bridges stay in place, causing the rigidity in the skeletal muscles.

 Sources of ATP

ATP supplies the energy for muscle contraction to take place. In addition to its direct role in the cross-bridge cycle,

ATP also provides the energy for the active-transport Ca** pumps in the SR. Muscle contraction does not occur without
sufficient amounts of ATP. The amount of ATP stored in muscle is very low, only sufficient to power a few seconds worth
of contractions. As it is broken down, ATP must therefore be regenerated and replaced quickly to allow for sustained
contraction. There are three mechanisms by which ATP can be regenerated: creatine phosphate metabolism, anaerobic
glycolysis, fermentation and aerobic respiration.
