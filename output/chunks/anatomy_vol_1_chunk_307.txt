The nucleus is the control center of the cell. The nucleus of living cells contains the genetic
material that determines the entire structure and function of that cell.

Figure 3.20 Multinucleate Muscle Cell Unlike cardiac muscle cells and smooth muscle cells, which have a single
nucleus, a skeletal muscle cell contains many nuclei, and is referred to as “multinucleated.” These muscle cells are
long and fibrous (often referred to as muscle fibers). During development, many smaller cells fuse to form a mature
muscle fiber. The nuclei of the fused cells are conserved in the mature cell, thus imparting a multinucleate characteristic
to mature muscle cells. LM x 104.3. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School ©
