Once the hormone binds to the receptor, a chain of
events is initiated that leads to the target cellâ€™s response. Hormones play a critical role in the regulation of physiological
processes because of the target cell responses they regulate. These responses contribute to human reproduction, growth and
development of body tissues, metabolism, fluid, and electrolyte balance, sleep, and many other body functions. The major
hormones of the human body and their effects are identified in Table 17.2.
