Henryâ€™s law states that the amount of a specific gas that dissolves in a liquid is a function
of its partial pressure. The greater the partial pressure of a gas, the more of that gas will dissolve in a liquid, as the gas
moves toward equilibrium. Gas molecules move down a pressure gradient; in other words, gas moves from a region of
high pressure to a region of low pressure. The partial pressure of oxygen is high in the alveoli and low in the blood of
the pulmonary capillaries. As a result, oxygen diffuses across the respiratory membrane from the alveoli into the blood. In
contrast, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is high in the pulmonary capillaries and low in the alveoli. Therefore, carbon
dioxide diffuses across the respiratory membrane from the blood into the alveoli. The amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide
that diffuses across the respiratory membrane is similar.

 Ventilation is the process that moves air into and out of the alveoli, and perfusion affects the flow of blood in the
capillaries.
