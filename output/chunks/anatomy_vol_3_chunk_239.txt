There are about 20 to 40 villi per square millimeter, increasing the surface area of the epithelium
tremendously. The mucosal epithelium, primarily composed of absorptive cells, covers the villi. In addition to muscle and
connective tissue to support its structure, each villus contains a capillary bed composed of one arteriole and one venule, as
well as a lymphatic capillary called a lacteal. The breakdown products of carbohydrates and proteins (sugars and amino
acids) can enter the bloodstream directly, but lipid breakdown products are absorbed by the lacteals and transported to the
bloodstream via the lymphatic system.

 Microvilli

As their name suggests, microvilli (singular = microvillus) are much smaller (1 ym) than villi. They are cylindrical
apical surface extensions of the plasma membrane of the mucosaâ€™s epithelial cells, and are supported by microfilaments
within those cells. Although their small size makes it difficult to see each microvillus, their combined microscopic
appearance suggests a mass of bristles, which is termed the brush border.
