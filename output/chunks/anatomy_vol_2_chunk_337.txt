The ampulla contains the hair cells that respond to
rotational movement, such as turning the head while saying “no.” The stereocilia of these hair cells extend into the cupula,
a membrane that attaches to the top of the ampulla. As the head rotates in a plane parallel to the semicircular canal, the
fluid lags, deflecting the cupula in the direction opposite to the head movement. The semicircular canals contain several
ampullae, with some oriented horizontally and others oriented vertically. By comparing the relative movements of both
the horizontal and vertical ampullae, the vestibular system can detect the direction of most head movements within three-
dimensional (3-D) space.

cells in the base of the semicircular canals.
