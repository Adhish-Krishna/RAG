These connections prevent separation between the
distal ends of the tibia and fibula and maintain the talus locked into position between the medial malleolus and lateral
malleolus. Injuries that produce a lateral twisting of the leg on top of the planted foot can result in stretching or tearing
of the tibiofibular ligaments, producing a syndesmotic ankle sprain or “high ankle sprain.”

Most ankle sprains can be treated using the RICE technique: Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. Reducing
joint mobility using a brace or cast may be required for a period of time. More severe injuries involving ligament tears

or bone fractures may require surgery.

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/anklejoint3) to learn more about the ligaments of the ankle joint, ankle
sprains, and treatment. During an inversion ankle sprain injury, all three ligaments that resist excessive inversion of the
foot may be injured. What is the sequence in which these three ligaments are injured?

CHAPTER 9| JOINTS 365

9.7 | Development of Joints

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the two processes by which mesenchyme can give rise to bone
¢ Discuss the process by which joints of the limbs are formed

Joints form during embryonic development in conjunction with the formation and growth of the associated bones.
