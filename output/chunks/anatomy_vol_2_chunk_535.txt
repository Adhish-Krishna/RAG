Drugs can be thought of as chemical tools to effect changes in the system with some precision, based
on where those drugs are effective.

 Nicotine is not a drug that is used therapeutically, except for smoking cessation. When it is introduced into the body
via products, it has broad effects on the autonomic system. Nicotine carries a risk for cardiovascular disease because of
these broad effects. The drug stimulates both sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia at the preganglionic fiber synapse.
 For most organ systems in the body, the competing input from the two postganglionic fibers will essentially cancel each
other out. However, for the cardiovascular system, the results are different. Because there is essentially no parasympathetic
influence on blood pressure for the entire body, the sympathetic input is increased by nicotine, causing an increase in
blood pressure. Also, the influence that the autonomic system has on the heart is not the same as for other systems.
