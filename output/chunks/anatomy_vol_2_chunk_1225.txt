To prevent confusion between these vessels, it is important to refer to the
vessel exiting the heart as the pulmonary trunk, rather than also calling it a pulmonary artery. The pulmonary arteries in turn
branch many times within the lung, forming a series of smaller arteries and arterioles that eventually lead to the pulmonary
capillaries. The pulmonary capillaries surround lung structures known as alveoli that are the sites of oxygen and carbon
dioxide exchange.

 Once gas exchange is completed, oxygenated blood flows from the pulmonary capillaries into a series of pulmonary
venules that eventually lead to a series of larger pulmonary veins. Four pulmonary veins, two on the left and two on the
right, return blood to the left atrium. At this point, the pulmonary circuit is complete. Table 20.4 defines the major arteries
and veins of the pulmonary circuit discussed in the text.
