Some ions assist in the
transmission of electrical impulses along cell membranes in neurons and muscles. Other ions help to stabilize protein
structures in enzymes. Still others aid in releasing hormones from endocrine glands. All of the ions in plasma contribute to
the osmotic balance that controls the movement of water between cells and their environment.

 Electrolytes in living systems include sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphate, magnesium,
copper, zinc, iron, manganese, molybdenum, copper, and chromium. In terms of body functioning, six electrolytes are most
important: sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, and phosphate.

Roles of Electrolytes

These six ions aid in nerve excitability, endocrine secretion, membrane permeability, buffering body fluids, and controlling
the movement of fluids between compartments.
