Explain the functions of connective tissues

As may be obvious from its name, one of the major functions of connective tissue is to connect tissues and organs. Unlike
epithelial tissue, which is composed of cells closely packed with little or no extracellular space in between, connective
tissue cells are dispersed in a matrix. The matrix usually includes a large amount of extracellular material produced by
the connective tissue cells that are embedded within it. The matrix plays a major role in the functioning of this tissue.
 The major component of the matrix is a ground substance often crisscrossed by protein fibers. This ground substance is
usually a fluid, but it can also be mineralized and solid, as in bones. Connective tissues come in a vast variety of forms, yet
they typically have in common three characteristic components: cells, large amounts of amorphous ground substance, and
protein fibers.
