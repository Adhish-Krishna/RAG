The transversospinales muscles run from the transverse processes to the spinous processes of the vertebrae. Similar
to the erector spinae muscles, the semispinalis muscles in this group are named for the areas of the body with which they
are associated. The semispinalis muscles include the semispinalis capitis, the semispinalis cervicis, and the semispinalis
thoracis. The multifidus muscle of the lumbar region helps extend and laterally flex the vertebral column.

 Important in the stabilization of the vertebral column is the segmental muscle group, which includes the interspinales
and intertransversarii muscles. These muscles bring together the spinous and transverse processes of each consecutive
vertebra. Finally, the scalene muscles work together to flex, laterally flex, and rotate the head. They also contribute to
deep inhalation. The scalene muscles include the anterior scalene muscle (anterior to the middle scalene), the middle

scalene muscle (the longest, intermediate between the anterior and posterior scalenes), and the posterior scalene muscle
(the smallest, posterior to the middle scalene).
