Tissue perfusion also increases as the body transitions from a resting state to light exercise and eventually to heavy
exercise (see Figure 20.20). These changes result in selective vasodilation in the skeletal muscles, heart, lungs, liver, and
integument. Simultaneously, vasoconstriction occurs in the vessels leading to the kidneys and most of the digestive and
reproductive organs. The flow of blood to the brain remains largely unchanged whether at rest or exercising, since the
vessels in the brain largely do not respond to regulatory stimuli, in most cases, because they lack the appropriate receptors.

CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 869

As vasodilation occurs in selected vessels, resistance drops and more blood rushes into the organs they supply. This
blood eventually returns to the venous system. Venous return is further enhanced by both the skeletal muscle and respiratory
pumps. As blood returns to the heart more quickly, preload rises and the Frank-Starling principle tells us that contraction
of the cardiac muscle in the atria and ventricles will be more forceful.
