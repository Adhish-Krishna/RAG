Neurons are cells and
therefore have a soma, or cell body, but they also have extensions of the cell; each extension is generally referred to as a
process. There is one important process that every neuron has called an axon, which is the fiber that connects a neuron with
its target. Another type of process that branches off from the soma is the dendrite. Dendrites are responsible for receiving
most of the input from other neurons. Looking at nervous tissue, there are regions that predominantly contain cell bodies
and regions that are largely composed of just axons. These two regions within nervous system structures are often referred
to as gray matter (the regions with many cell bodies and dendrites) or white matter (the regions with many axons). Figure
12.3 demonstrates the appearance of these regions in the brain and spinal cord. The colors ascribed to these regions are
what would be seen in “fresh,” or unstained, nervous tissue.
