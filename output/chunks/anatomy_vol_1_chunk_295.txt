Cells called hepatocytes in the liver detoxify many of these toxins.

 Mitochondria

A mitochondrion (plural = mitochondria) is a membranous, bean-shaped organelle that is the “energy transformer” of
the cell. Mitochondria consist of an outer lipid bilayer membrane as well as an additional inner lipid bilayer membrane
(Figure 3.16). The inner membrane is highly folded into winding structures with a great deal of surface area, called cristae.
 It is along this inner membrane that a series of proteins, enzymes, and other molecules perform the biochemical reactions
of cellular respiration. These reactions convert energy stored in nutrient molecules (such as glucose) into adenosine
triphosphate (ATP), which provides usable cellular energy to the cell. Cells use ATP constantly, and so the mitochondria
are constantly at work. Oxygen molecules are required during cellular respiration, which is why you must constantly
breathe it in. One of the organ systems in the body that uses huge amounts of ATP is the muscular system because ATP
is required to sustain muscle contraction.
