Hyperthyroidism
can lead to an increased metabolic rate, excessive body heat and sweating, diarrhea, weight loss, tremors, and increased
heart rate. The person’s eyes may bulge (called exophthalmos) as antibodies produce inflammation in the soft tissues
of the orbits. The person may also develop a goiter.

 Calcitonin

 The thyroid gland also secretes a hormone called calcitonin that is produced by the parafollicular cells (also called C cells)
that stud the tissue between distinct follicles. Calcitonin is released in response to a rise in blood calcium levels. It appears
to have a function in decreasing blood calcium concentrations by:

¢ Inhibiting the activity of osteoclasts, bone cells that release calcium into the circulation by degrading bone matrix

¢ Increasing osteoblastic activity
