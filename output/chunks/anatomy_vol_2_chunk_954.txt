Eventually, these vessels will lead to the systemic capillaries,
where exchange with the tissue fluid and cells of the body occurs. In this case, oxygen and nutrients exit the systemic
capillaries to be used by the cells in their metabolic processes, and carbon dioxide and waste products will enter the blood.

 The blood exiting the systemic capillaries is lower in oxygen concentration than when it entered. The capillaries will
ultimately unite to form venules, joining to form ever-larger veins, eventually flowing into the two major systemic veins,
the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava, which return blood to the right atrium. The blood in the superior
and inferior venae cavae flows into the right atrium, which pumps blood into the right ventricle. This process of blood
circulation continues as long as the individual remains alive. Understanding the flow of blood through the pulmonary and
systemic circuits is critical to all health professions (Figure 19.4).
