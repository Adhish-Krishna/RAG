One way the
body compensates is to manufacture more red blood cells by increasing EPO production. If you start an aerobic exercise
program, your tissues will need more oxygen to cope, and the kidney will respond with more EPO. If erythrocytes are lost
due to severe or prolonged bleeding, or under produced due to disease or severe malnutrition, the kidneys come to the rescue
by producing more EPO. Renal failure (loss of EPO production) is associated with anemia, which makes it difficult for
the body to cope with increased oxygen demands or to supply oxygen adequately even under normal conditions. Anemia
diminishes performance and can be life threatening.

 Blood Pressure Regulation

Due to osmosis, water follows where Na‚Äù leads. Much of the water the kidneys recover from the forming urine follows the

reabsorption of Na". ADH stimulation of aquaporin channels allows for regulation of water recovery in the collecting ducts.
 Normally, all of the glucose is recovered, but loss of glucose control (diabetes mellitus) may result in an osmotic dieresis
severe enough to produce severe dehydration and death.
