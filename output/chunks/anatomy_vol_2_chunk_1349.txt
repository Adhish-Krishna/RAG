Show how the innate immune response is important and how it helps guide and prepare the body for adaptive
immune responses

¢ Describe various soluble factors that are part of the innate immune response
¢ Explain the steps of inflammation and how they lead to destruction of a pathogen
¢ Discuss early induced immune responses and their level of effectiveness

The immune system can be divided into two overlapping mechanisms to destroy pathogens: the innate immune response,
which is relatively rapid but nonspecific and thus not always effective, and the adaptive immune response, which is slower
in its development during an initial infection with a pathogen, but is highly specific and effective at attacking a wide variety
of pathogens (Figure 21.12).
