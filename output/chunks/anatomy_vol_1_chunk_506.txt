The underlying hypodermis has important roles in
storing fats, forming a “cushion” over underlying structures, and providing insulation from cold temperatures.

 Protection

The skin protects the rest of the body from the basic elements of nature such as wind, water, and UV sunlight. It acts as a
protective barrier against water loss, due to the presence of layers of keratin and glycolipids in the stratum corneum. It also
is the first line of defense against abrasive activity due to contact with grit, microbes, or harmful chemicals. Sweat excreted
from sweat glands deters microbes from over-colonizing the skin surface by generating dermicidin, which has antibiotic
properties.

Tattoos and Piercings

The word “armor” evokes several images. You might think of a Roman centurion or a medieval knight in a suit of
armor. The skin, in its own way, functions as a form of armor—body armor. It provides a barrier between your vital,
life-sustaining organs and the influence of outside elements that could potentially damage them.
