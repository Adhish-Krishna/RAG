In contrast to these phases, the Go phase is a
resting phase of the cell cycle. Cells that have temporarily stopped dividing and are resting (a common condition) and cells
that have permanently ceased dividing (like nerve cells) are said to be in Go.

 The Structure of Chromosomes

Billions of cells in the human body divide every day. During the synthesis phase (S, for DNA synthesis) of interphase,
the amount of DNA within the cell precisely doubles. Therefore, after DNA replication but before cell division, each cell
actually contains two copies of each chromosome. Each copy of the chromosome is referred to as a sister chromatid and is
physically bound to the other copy. The centromere is the structure that attaches one sister chromatid to another. Because
a human cell has 46 chromosomes, during this phase, there are 92 chromatids (46 * 2) in the cell.
