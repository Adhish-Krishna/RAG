A suture is the narrow
fibrous joint that unites most bones of the skull. At a gomphosis, the root of a tooth is anchored across a narrow gap by
periodontal ligaments to the walls of its socket in the bony jaw. A syndesmosis is the type of fibrous joint found between
parallel bones. The gap between the bones may be wide and filled with a fibrous interosseous membrane, or it may narrow
with ligaments spanning between the bones. Syndesmoses are found between the bones of the forearm (radius and ulna)
and the leg (tibia and fibula). Fibrous joints strongly unite adjacent bones and thus serve to provide protection for internal
organs, strength to body regions, or weight-bearing stability.

 9.3 Cartilaginous Joints
There are two types of cartilaginous joints. A synchondrosis is formed when the adjacent bones are united by hyaline

cartilage. A temporary synchondrosis is formed by the epiphyseal plate of a growing long bone, which is lost when the
epiphyseal plate ossifies as the bone reaches maturity.
