In addition, alveolar air contains
a greater amount of carbon dioxide and less oxygen than atmospheric air. This is no surprise, as gas exchange removes
oxygen from and adds carbon dioxide to alveolar air. Both deep and forced breathing cause the alveolar air composition to
be changed more rapidly than during quiet breathing. As a result, the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide change,
affecting the diffusion process that moves these materials across the membrane. This will cause oxygen to enter and carbon
dioxide to leave the blood more quickly.

Ventilation and Perfusion

Two important aspects of gas exchange in the lung are ventilation and perfusion.
