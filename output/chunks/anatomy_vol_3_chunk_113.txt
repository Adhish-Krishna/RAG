Muscles that perform work during exercise do
increase their demand for oxygen, stimulating an increase in ventilation. However, hyperpnea during exercise appears
to occur before a drop in oxygen levels within the muscles can occur. Therefore, hyperpnea must be driven by other
mechanisms, either instead of or in addition to a drop in oxygen levels. The exact mechanisms behind exercise hyperpnea
are not well understood, and some hypotheses are somewhat controversial. However, in addition to low oxygen, high
carbon dioxide, and low pH levels, there appears to be a complex interplay of factors related to the nervous system and the
respiratory centers of the brain.

 First, a conscious decision to partake in exercise, or another form of physical exertion, results in a psychological
stimulus that may trigger the respiratory centers of the brain to increase ventilation. In addition, the respiratory centers
of the brain may be stimulated through the activation of motor neurons that innervate muscle groups that are involved in
the physical activity.
