Each of these mechanisms relies on the property of heat to flow from a
higher concentration to a lower concentration; therefore, each of the mechanisms of heat exchange varies in rate according
to the temperature and conditions of the environment.

 Conduction is the transfer of heat by two objects that are in direct contact with one another. It occurs when the skin
comes in contact with a cold or warm object. For example, when holding a glass of ice water, the heat from your skin will
warm the glass and in turn melt the ice. Alternatively, on a cold day, you might warm up by wrapping your cold hands
around a hot mug of coffee. Only about 3 percent of the body’s heat is lost through conduction.

 Convection is the transfer of heat to the air surrounding the skin. The warmed air rises away from the body and is
replaced by cooler air that is subsequently heated. Convection can also occur in water. When the water temperature is lower
than the body’s temperature, the body loses heat by warming the water closest to the skin, which moves away to be replaced
by cooler water.
