The less saturated hemoglobin is and the lower the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood is, the more readily
hemoglobin binds to carbon dioxide. This is an example of the Haldane effect.

22.6 Modifications in Respiratory Functions

Normally, the respiratory centers of the brain maintain a consistent, rhythmic breathing cycle. However, in certain cases,

exercise results in increased ventilation, and chronic exposure to a high altitude results in a greater number of circulating
erythrocytes. Hyperpnea, an increase in the rate and depth of ventilation, appears to be a function of three neural
mechanisms that include a psychological stimulus, motor neuron activation of skeletal muscles, and the activation of
proprioceptors in the muscles, joints, and tendons.
