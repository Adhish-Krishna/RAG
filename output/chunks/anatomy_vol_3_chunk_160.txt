The mucosa is referred to as a mucous membrane, because mucus production is a characteristic feature of gut
epithelium. The membrane consists of epithelium, which is in direct contact with ingested food, and the lamina propria,
a layer of connective tissue analogous to the dermis. In addition, the mucosa has a thin, smooth muscle layer, called the
muscularis mucosa (not to be confused with the muscularis layer, described below).

 Epitheliumâ€”In the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, and anal canal, the epithelium is primarily a non-keratinized, stratified
squamous epithelium. In the stomach and intestines, it is a simple columnar epithelium. Notice that the epithelium is in
direct contact with the lumen, the space inside the alimentary canal. Interspersed among its epithelial cells are goblet cells,
which secrete mucus and fluid into the lumen, and enteroendocrine cells, which secrete hormones into the interstitial spaces
between cells.
