Such compounds are referred to as hydrophilic,
or “water-loving.” As mentioned above, sugar dissolves well in water. This is because sugar molecules contain regions of
hydrogen-oxygen polar bonds, making it hydrophilic. Nonpolar molecules, which do not readily dissolve in water, are called
hydrophobic, or “water-fearing.”

Concentrations of Solutes

Various mixtures of solutes and water are described in chemistry. The concentration of a given solute is the number of
particles of that solute in a given space (oxygen makes up about 21 percent of atmospheric air). In the bloodstream of
humans, glucose concentration is usually measured in milligram (mg) per deciliter (dL), and in a healthy adult averages
about 100 mg/dL. Another method of measuring the concentration of a solute is by its molarilty—which is moles (M) of the
molecules per liter (L).
