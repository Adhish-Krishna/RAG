The low partial pressure of
oxygen at high altitudes results in a lower oxygen saturation level of hemoglobin in the blood. In turn, the tissue levels
of oxygen are also lower. As a result, the kidneys are stimulated to produce the hormone erythropoietin (EPO), which
stimulates the production of erythrocytes, resulting in a greater number of circulating erythrocytes in an individual at a high
altitude over a long period. With more red blood cells, there is more hemoglobin to help transport the available oxygen.
 Even though there is low saturation of each hemoglobin molecule, there will be more hemoglobin present, and therefore
more oxygen in the blood. Over time, this allows the person to partake in physical exertion without developing AMS.
