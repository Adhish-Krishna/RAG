A genetic disorder, it is caused by production of an abnormal type of hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S,
which delivers less oxygen to tissues and causes erythrocytes to assume a sickle (or crescent) shape, especially at low
oxygen concentrations (Figure 18.9). These abnormally shaped cells can then become lodged in narrow capillaries
because they are unable to fold in on themselves to squeeze through, blocking blood flow to tissues and causing a
variety of serious problems from painful joints to delayed growth and even blindness and cerebrovascular accidents
(strokes). Sickle cell anemia is a genetic condition particularly found in individuals of African descent.

 Figure 18.9 Sickle Cells Sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in one of the hemoglobin genes. Erythrocytes
produce an abnormal type of hemoglobin, which causes the cell to take on a sickle or crescent shape. (credit: Janice

 Â¢ Iron deficiency anemia is the most common type and results when the amount of available iron is insufficient to allow
production of sufficient heme.
