Lysosome

(0) The globin (protein) portion of hemoglobin
is metabolized into amino acids, which are
reused for protein synthesis. The cell
components (organelles, membrane
structures, etc.) are also recycled.

 Figure 18.8 Erythrocyte Lifecycle Erythrocytes are produced in the bone marrow and sent into the circulation. At
the end of their lifecycle, they are destroyed by macrophages, and their components are recycled.

 Disorders of Erythrocytes

The size, shape, and number of erythrocytes, and the number of hemoglobin molecules can have a major impact on a
personâ€™s health. When the number of RBCs or hemoglobin is deficient, the general condition is called anemia. There are
more than 400 types of anemia and more than 3.5 million Americans suffer from this condition. Anemia can be broken
down into three major groups: those caused by blood loss, those caused by faulty or decreased RBC production, and
those caused by excessive destruction of RBCs.
