She interrupts your protests that you cannot stop playing.
 She issues a stern warning about the risk of aggravating the condition and the possibility of surgery. She consoles you
by mentioning that well known tennis players such as Venus and Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal have also suffered
from tendinitis related injuries.

 What is tendinitis and how did it happen? Tendinitis is the inflammation of a tendon, the thick band of fibrous
connective tissue that attaches a muscle to a bone. The condition causes pain and tenderness in the area around a
joint. On rare occasions, a sudden serious injury will cause tendinitis. Most often, the condition results from repetitive
motions over time that strain the tendons needed to perform the tasks.

 Persons whose jobs and hobbies involve performing the same movements over and over again are often at the
greatest risk of tendinitis. You hear of tennis and golfer’s elbow, jumper's knee, and swimmer’s shoulder.
