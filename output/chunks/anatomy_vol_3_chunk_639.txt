Figure 26.18 Symptoms of Acidosis and Alkalosis Symptoms of acidosis affect several organ systems. Both
acidosis and alkalosis can be diagnosed using a blood test.

 Metabolic Acidosis: Primary Bicarbonate Deficiency

Metabolic acidosis occurs when the blood is too acidic (pH below 7.35) due to too little bicarbonate, a condition called
primary bicarbonate deficiency. At the normal pH of 7.40, the ratio of bicarbonate to carbonic acid buffer is 20:1. If a
personâ€™s blood pH drops below 7.35, then he or she is in metabolic acidosis. The most common cause of metabolic acidosis
is the presence of organic acids or excessive ketones in the blood. Table 26.2 lists some other causes of metabolic acidosis.

 Common Causes of Metabolic Acidosis and Blood Metabolites

Uremia Phosphoric, sulfuric, and lactic acids

Diabetic ketoacidosis Increased ketones

Strenuous exercise Lactic acid

Methanol Formic acid*

Paraldehyde B-Hydroxybutyric acid*

lsopropanol Propionic acid*

Glycolic acid, and some oxalic and formic acids*
Sulfasalicylic acid (SSA)
