Amino acids in the structure of the protein are sensitive to charge and cause the pore to open to the
selected ion.

 A leakage channel is randomly gated, meaning that it opens and closes at random, hence the reference to leaking.
 There is no actual event that opens the channel; instead, it has an intrinsic rate of switching between the open and closed
states. Leakage channels contribute to the resting transmembrane voltage of the excitable membrane (Figure 12.21).

Figure 12.21 Leakage Channels _ In certain situations, ions need to move across the membrane randomly. The
particular electrical properties of certain cells are modified by the presence of this type of channel.

 The Membrane Potential

The electrical state of the cell membrane can have several variations. These are all variations in the membrane potential.
 A potential is a distribution of charge across the cell membrane, measured in millivolts (mV).
