The zygomatic arch is formed jointly by the zygomatic process of the temporal bone and the temporal
process of the zygomatic bone. The shallow space above the zygomatic arch is the temporal fossa. The space inferior
to the zygomatic arch and deep to the posterior mandible is the infratemporal fossa.

 Bones of the Brain Case

The brain case contains and protects the brain. The interior space that is almost completely occupied by the brain is called
the cranial cavity. This cavity is bounded superiorly by the rounded top of the skull, which is called the calvaria (skullcap),
and the lateral and posterior sides of the skull. The bones that form the top and sides of the brain case are usually referred
to as the “flat” bones of the skull.

 The floor of the brain case is referred to as the base of the skull. This is a complex area that varies in depth and
has numerous openings for the passage of cranial nerves, blood vessels, and the spinal cord.
