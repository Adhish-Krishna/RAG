 Regulation of Calcium and Phosphate

Calcium and phosphate are both regulated through the actions of three hormones: parathyroid hormone (PTH),
dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol), and calcitonin. All three are released or synthesized in response to the blood levels of

calcium.

PTH is released from the parathyroid gland in response to a decrease in the concentration of blood calcium. The
hormone activates osteoclasts to break down bone matrix and release inorganic calcium-phosphate salts. PTH also increases
the gastrointestinal absorption of dietary calcium by converting vitamin D into dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol), an active
form of vitamin D that intestinal epithelial cells require to absorb calcium.

PTH raises blood calcium levels by inhibiting the loss of calcium through the kidneys.
