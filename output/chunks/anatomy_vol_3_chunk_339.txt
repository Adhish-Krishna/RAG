Glycolysis

Glucose is the bodyâ€™s most readily available source of energy. After digestive processes break polysaccharides down into
monosaccharides, including glucose, the monosaccharides are transported across the wall of the small intestine and into
the circulatory system, which transports them to the liver. In the liver, hepatocytes either pass the glucose on through the
circulatory system or store excess glucose as glycogen. Cells in the body take up the circulating glucose in response to
insulin and, through a series of reactions called glycolysis, transfer some of the energy in glucose to ADP to form ATP
(Figure 24.5). The last step in glycolysis produces the product pyruvate.

 1086 CHAPTER 24 | METABOLISM AND NUTRITION

Glycolysis begins with the phosphorylation of glucose by hexokinase to form glucose-6-phosphate. This step uses one
ATP, which is the donor of the phosphate group. Under the action of phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate is converted
into fructose-6-phosphate. At this point, a second ATP donates its phosphate group, forming fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.
