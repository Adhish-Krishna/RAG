Between the tibial condyles is the intercondylar eminence. On the anterior
side of the proximal tibia is the tibial tuberosity, which is continuous inferiorly with the anterior border of the tibia. On the

posterior side, the proximal tibia has the curved soleal line. The bony expansion on the medial side of the distal tibia is the
medial malleolus. The groove on the lateral side of the distal tibia is the fibular notch.

 The head of the fibula forms the proximal end and articulates with the underside of the lateral condyle of the tibia. The
distal fibula articulates with the fibular notch of the tibia. The expanded distal end of the fibula is the lateral malleolus.

 The posterior foot is formed by the seven tarsal bones. The talus articulates superiorly with the distal tibia, the medial
malleolus of the tibia, and the lateral malleolus of the fibula to form the ankle joint.
