Â¢ The parotid glands lie between the skin and the masseter muscle, near the ears. They secrete saliva into the mouth
through the parotid duct, which is located near the second upper molar tooth (Figure 23.9).

 Saliva

Saliva is essentially (95.5 percent) water. The remaining 4.5 percent is a complex mixture of ions, glycoproteins, enzymes,
growth factors, and waste products. Perhaps the most important ingredient in salvia from the perspective of digestion
is the enzyme salivary amylase, which initiates the breakdown of carbohydrates. Food does not spend enough time in
the mouth to allow all the carbohydrates to break down, but salivary amylase continues acting until it is inactivated by
stomach acids. Bicarbonate and phosphate ions function as chemical buffers, maintaining saliva at a pH between 6.35 and
6.85. Salivary mucus helps lubricate food, facilitating movement in the mouth, bolus formation, and swallowing. Saliva
contains immunoglobulin A, which prevents microbes from penetrating the epithelium, and lysozyme, which makes saliva
antimicrobial.
