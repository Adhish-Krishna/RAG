Later, the cells become double positives that express both CD4 and CD8 markers and move from the cortex to the
junction between the cortex and medulla. It is here that negative selection takes place. In negative selection, self-antigens
are brought into the thymus from other parts of the body by professional antigen-presenting cells. The T cells that bind to
these self-antigens are selected for negatively and are killed by apoptosis. In summary, the only T cells left are those that
can bind to MHC molecules of the body with foreign antigens presented on their binding clefts, preventing an attack on
oneâ€™s own body tissues, at least under normal circumstances. Tolerance can be broken, however, by the development of an
autoimmune response, to be discussed later in this chapter.

 The cells that leave the thymus become single positives, expressing either CD4 or CD8, but not both (see Figure
21.18).
