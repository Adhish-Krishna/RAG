25.7 | Regulation of Renal Blood Flow

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

¢ Describe the myogenic and tubuloglomerular feedback mechanisms and explain how they affect urine volume and
composition

 ¢ Describe the function of the juxtaglomerular apparatus

It is vital that the flow of blood through the kidney be at a suitable rate to allow for filtration. This rate determines how
much solute is retained or discarded, how much water is retained or discarded, and ultimately, the osmolarity of blood and
the blood pressure of the body.

 Sympathetic Nerves

The kidneys are innervated by the sympathetic neurons of the autonomic nervous system via the celiac plexus and
splanchnic nerves. Reduction of sympathetic stimulation results in vasodilation and increased blood flow through the
kidneys during resting conditions. When the frequency of action potentials increases, the arteriolar smooth muscle constricts
(vasoconstriction), resulting in diminished glomerular flow, so less filtration occurs.
