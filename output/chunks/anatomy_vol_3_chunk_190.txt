These allow you to change the size and shape of your tongue,
as well as to stick it out, if you wish. Having such a flexible tongue facilitates both swallowing and speech.
 As you learned in your study of the muscular system, the extrinsic muscles of the tongue are the mylohyoid,
hyoglossus, styloglossus, and genioglossus muscles. These muscles originate outside the tongue and insert into connective
tissues within the tongue. The mylohyoid is responsible for raising the tongue, the hyoglossus pulls it down and back, the
styloglossus pulls it up and back, and the genioglossus pulls it forward. Working in concert, these muscles perform three
important digestive functions in the mouth: (1) position food for optimal chewing, (2) gather food into a bolus (rounded
mass), and (3) position food so it can be swallowed.
