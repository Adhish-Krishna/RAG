Relate fetal heart structures to adult counterparts

The human heart is the first functional organ to develop. It begins beating and pumping blood around day 21 or 22, a mere
three weeks after fertilization. This emphasizes the critical nature of the heart in distributing blood through the vessels and
the vital exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and wastes both to and from the developing baby. The critical early development of
the heart is reflected by the prominent heart bulge that appears on the anterior surface of the embryo.

 The heart forms from an embryonic tissue called mesoderm around 18 to 19 days after fertilization. Mesoderm is one
of the three primary germ layers that differentiates early in development that collectively gives rise to all subsequent tissues
and organs. The heart begins to develop near the head of the embryo in a region known as the cardiogenic area. Following
chemical signals called factors from the underlying endoderm (another of the three primary germ layers), the cardiogenic
area begins to form two strands called the cardiogenic cords (Figure 19.36).
