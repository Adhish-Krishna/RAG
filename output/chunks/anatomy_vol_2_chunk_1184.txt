The pressure created by the concentration of colloidal proteins in the blood is called the blood colloidal osmotic
pressure (BCOP). Its effect on capillary exchange accounts for the reabsorption of water. The plasma proteins suspended
in blood cannot move across the semipermeable capillary cell membrane, and so they remain in the plasma. As a result,
blood has a higher colloidal concentration and lower water concentration than tissue fluid. It therefore attracts water. We can
also say that the BCOP is higher than the interstitial fluid colloidal osmotic pressure (IFCOP), which is always very low
because interstitial fluid contains few proteins. Thus, water is drawn from the tissue fluid back into the capillary, carrying
dissolved molecules with it. This difference in colloidal osmotic pressure accounts for reabsorption.

 Interaction of Hydrostatic and Osmotic Pressures

The normal unit used to express pressures within the cardiovascular system is millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).
