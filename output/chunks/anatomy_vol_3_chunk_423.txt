In addition to ATP, the Krebs cycle produces high-energy FADH2 and NADH molecules, which provide electrons to
the oxidative phosphorylation process that generates more high-energy ATP molecules. For each molecule of glucose that
is processed in glycolysis, a net of 36 ATPs can be created by aerobic respiration.

 Under anaerobic conditions, ATP production is limited to those generated by glycolysis. While a total of four ATPs are
produced by glycolysis, two are needed to begin glycolysis, so there is a net yield of two ATP molecules.

 In conditions of low glucose, such as fasting, starvation, or low carbohydrate diets, glucose can be synthesized from
lactate, pyruvate, glycerol, alanine, or glutamate. This process, called gluconeogenesis, is almost the reverse of glycolysis
and serves to create glucose molecules for glucose-dependent organs, such as the brain, when glucose levels fall below
normal.
