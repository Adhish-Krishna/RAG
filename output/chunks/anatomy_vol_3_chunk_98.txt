When all four
heme sites are occupied, the hemoglobin is said to be saturated. When one to three heme sites are occupied, the hemoglobin
is said to be partially saturated. Therefore, when considering the blood as a whole, the percent of the available heme units
that are bound to oxygen at a given time is called hemoglobin saturation. Hemoglobin saturation of 100 percent means that
every heme unit in all of the erythrocytes of the body is bound to oxygen. In a healthy individual with normal hemoglobin
levels, hemoglobin saturation generally ranges from 95 percent to 99 percent.

Oxygen Dissociation from Hemoglobin

Partial pressure is an important aspect of the binding of oxygen to and disassociation from heme. An oxygenâ€”hemoglobin
dissociation curve is a graph that describes the relationship of partial pressure to the binding of oxygen to heme and its
subsequent dissociation from heme (Figure 22.26).
