This signaling is inhibited when glucocorticoid levels become
elevated by causing negative signals to the pituitary gland and hypothalamus.

 Role of Endocrine Gland Stimuli

Reflexes triggered by both chemical and neural stimuli control endocrine activity. These reflexes may be simple, involving
only one hormone response, or they may be more complex and involve many hormones, as is the case with the hypothalamic
control of various anterior pituitaryâ€”controlled hormones.

 Humoral stimuli are changes in blood levels of non-hormone chemicals, such as nutrients or ions, which cause the
release or inhibition of a hormone to, in turn, maintain homeostasis. For example, osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus detect
changes in blood osmolarity (the concentration of solutes in the blood plasma). If blood osmolarity is too high, meaning that
the blood is not dilute enough, osmoreceptors signal the hypothalamus to release ADH. The hormone causes the kidneys to
reabsorb more water and reduce the volume of urine produced.
