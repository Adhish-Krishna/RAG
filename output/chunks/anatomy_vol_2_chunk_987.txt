Figure 19.14 Blood Flow from the Left Ventricle into the Great Vessels (a) A transverse section through the
heart illustrates the four heart valves during ventricular contraction. The two atrioventricular valves are closed, but the
two semilunar valves are open. The atria and vessels have been removed. (b) A frontal view shows the closed mitral
(bicuspid) valve that prevents backflow of blood into the left atrium. The aortic semilunar valve is open to allow blood
to be ejected into the aorta.

 When the ventricles begin to contract, pressure within the ventricles rises and blood flows toward the area of lowest
pressure, which is initially in the atria.
