Sensory Nerves

The olfactory, optic, and vestibulocochlear nerves (cranial nerves I, II, and VIII) are dedicated to four of the special senses:
smell, vision, equilibrium, and hearing, respectively. Taste sensation is relayed to the brain stem through fibers of the facial
and glossopharyngeal nerves. The trigeminal nerve is a mixed nerve that carries the general somatic senses from the head,
similar to those coming through spinal nerves from the rest of the body.
 Testing smell is straightforward, as common smells are presented to one nostril at a time. The patient should be able to
recognize the smell of coffee or mint, indicating the proper functioning of the olfactory system. Loss of the sense of smell is
called anosmia and can be lost following blunt trauma to the head or through aging. The short axons of the first cranial nerve
regenerate on a regular basis. The neurons in the olfactory epithelium have a limited life span, and new cells grow to replace
the ones that die off.
