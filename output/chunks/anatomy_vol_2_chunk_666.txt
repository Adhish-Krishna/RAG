Damage from acute injuries
such as strokes may result in specific functions being lost, whereas broader effects in infection or developmental disorders
may result in general losses across an entire section of the neurological exam.

 16.4 The Sensory and Motor Exams

The sensory and motor exams assess function related to the spinal cord and the nerves connected to it. Sensory functions are
associated with the dorsal regions of the spinal cord, whereas motor function is associated with the ventral side. Localizing
damage to the spinal cord is related to assessments of the peripheral projections mapped to dermatomes.

 Sensory tests address the various submodalities of the somatic senses: touch, temperature, vibration, pain, and
proprioception. Results of the subtests can point to trauma in the spinal cord gray matter, white matter, or even in
connections to the cerebral cortex.

 Motor tests focus on the function of the muscles and the connections of the descending motor pathway. Muscle tone
and strength are tested for upper and lower extremities.
