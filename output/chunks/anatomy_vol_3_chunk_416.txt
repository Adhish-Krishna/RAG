Sodium and chloride ions are electrolytes in the blood and extracellular tissues, and iron ions are
critical to the formation of hemoglobin. There are additional trace minerals that are still important to the body’s functions,
but their required quantities are much lower.

 Like vitamins, minerals can be consumed in toxic quantities (although it is rare). A healthy diet includes most of the
minerals your body requires, so supplements and processed foods can add potentially toxic levels of minerals. Table 24.5
and Table 24.6 provide a summary of minerals and their function in the body.
