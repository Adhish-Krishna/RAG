The other part of a reflex,
the afferent branch, is often the same between the two systems. Sensory neurons receiving input from the periphery—with
cell bodies in the sensory ganglia, either of a cranial nerve or a dorsal root ganglion adjacent to the spinal cord—project into
the CNS to initiate the reflex (Figure 15.6). The Latin root “effere” means “to carry.” Adding the prefix “ef-” suggests the
meaning “to carry away,” whereas adding the prefix “af-” suggests “to carry toward or inward.”
