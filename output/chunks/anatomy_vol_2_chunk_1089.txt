Any condition that increases resistance requires a greater afterload to force open the semilunar valves and
pump the blood. Damage to the valves, such as stenosis, which makes them harder to open will also increase afterload. Any
decrease in resistance decreases the afterload. Figure 19.34 summarizes the major factors influencing SV, Figure 19.35
summarizes the major factors influencing CO, and Table 19.3 and Table 19.4 summarize cardiac responses to increased
and decreased blood flow and pressure in order to restore homeostasis.

CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 825

Factors Affecting Stroke Volume (SV)
* fast filling time * sympathetic stimulation * increased vascular restistance
due to: * increased venous return * epinephrine and norepinephrine * semilunar valve damage
* high intracellular calcium ions
* high blood calcium level
* thyroid hormones.
