Throughout development
and adulthood, the process of cellular differentiation leads cells to assume their final morphology and physiology.
 Differentiation is the process by which unspecialized cells become specialized to carry out distinct functions.

 Stem Cells

A stem cell is an unspecialized cell that can divide without limit as needed and can, under specific conditions, differentiate
into specialized cells. Stem cells are divided into several categories according to their potential to differentiate.

 The first embryonic cells that arise from the division of the zygote are the ultimate stem cells; these stems cells are
described as totipotent because they have the potential to differentiate into any of the cells needed to enable an organism to
grow and develop.

 The embryonic cells that develop from totipotent stem cells and are precursors to the fundamental tissue layers of the
embryo are classified as pluripotent. A pluripotent stem cell is one that has the potential to differentiate into any type of
human tissue but cannot support the full development of an organism.
