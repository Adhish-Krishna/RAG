The three basic types of cell-to-cell junctions are tight junctions, gap junctions,
and anchoring junctions.

 At one end of the spectrum is the tight junction, which separates the cells into apical and basal compartments. An
anchoring junction includes several types of cell junctions that help stabilize epithelial tissues. Anchoring junctions are
common on the lateral and basal surfaces of cells where they provide strong and flexible connections. There are three types

of anchoring junctions: desmosomes, hemidesmosomes, and adherens. Desmosomes occur in patches on the membranes of
cells. The patches are structural proteins on the inner surface of the cellâ€™s membrane. The adhesion molecule, cadherin, is
embedded in these patches and projects through the cell membrane to link with the cadherin molecules of adjacent cells.
 These connections are especially important in holding cells together. Hemidesmosomes, which look like half a desmosome,
link cells to the extracellular matrix, for example, the basal lamina.
