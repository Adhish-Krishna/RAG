The direct pathway causes the disinhibition of the thalamus (inhibition of one cell on a target cell that then inhibits the
first cell), whereas the indirect pathway causes, or reinforces, the normal inhibition of the thalamus. The thalamus then can
either excite the cortex (as a result of the direct pathway) or fail to excite the cortex (as a result of the indirect pathway).

connection releasing glutamate as a neurotransmitter.
