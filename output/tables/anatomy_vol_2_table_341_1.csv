"Heart Valves
When heart valves do not function properly, they are often described as incompetent and result in valvular heart
disease, which can range from benign to lethal. Some of these conditions are congenital, that is, the individual was
bornwiththedefect,whereasothersmaybeattributedtodiseaseprocessesortrauma.Somemalfunctionsaretreated

since treatment might trigger more serious consequences.
Valvular disorders are often caused by carditis, or inflammation of the heart. One common trigger for this
inflammation is rheumatic fever, or scarlet fever, an autoimmune response to the presence of a bacterium,
Streptococcus pyogenes, normally a disease of childhood.
While any of the heart valves may be involved in valve disorders, mitral regurgitation is the most common,
detected in approximately 2 percent of the population, and the pulmonary semilunar valve is the least frequently
involved.Whenavalvemalfunctions,theflowofbloodtoaregionwilloftenbedisrupted.Theresultinginadequate

is named for the valve involved: aortic insufficiency, mitral insufficiency, tricuspid insufficiency, or pulmonary
insufficiency.
If one of the cusps of the valve is forced backward by the force of the blood, the condition is referred to as a

(heart attack). In this case, the patient’s condition will deteriorate dramatically and rapidly, and immediate surgical
intervention may be required.
