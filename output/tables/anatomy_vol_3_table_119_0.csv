"Metabolic Processes: Cushing Syndrome and Addison’s Disease
As might be expected for a fundamental physiological process like metabolism, errors or malfunctions in metabolic
processing lead to a pathophysiology or—if uncorrected—a disease state. Metabolic diseases are most commonly
the result of malfunctioning proteins or enzymes that are critical to one or more metabolic pathways. Protein or
enzyme malfunction can be the consequence of a genetic alteration or mutation. However, normally functioning
proteinsandenzymescanalsohavedeleteriouseffectsiftheiravailabilityisnotappropriatelymatchedwithmetabolic
need. For example, excessive production of the hormone cortisol (see Table 24.1) gives rise to Cushing syndrome.
Clinically,Cushingsyndromeischaracterizedbyrapidweightgain,especiallyinthetrunkandfaceregion,depression,
and anxiety. It is worth mentioning that tumors of the pituitary that produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH),
which subsequently stimulates the adrenal cortex to release excessive cortisol, produce similar effects. This indirect
mechanism of cortisol overproduction is referred to as Cushing disease.

Insufficient cortisol production is equally problematic. Adrenal insufficiency, or Addison’s disease, is

involves cortisol replacement therapy, which usually must be continued for life.",
