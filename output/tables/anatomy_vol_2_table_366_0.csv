"Heart: Abnormal Heart Rates
For an adult, normal resting HR will be in the range of 60â€“100 bpm. Bradycardia is the condition in which resting
ratedropsbelow60bpm,andtachycardiaistheconditioninwhichtherestingrateisabove100bpm.Trainedathletes
typically have very low HRs. If the patient is not exhibiting other symptoms, such as weakness, fatigue, dizziness,
fainting, chest discomfort, palpitations, or respiratory distress, bradycardia is not considered clinically significant.

still suffering from these symptoms. Most patients remain asymptomatic as long as the HR remains above 50 bpm.
Bradycardia may be caused by either inherent factors or causes external to the heart. While the condition may

node. If the condition is serious, a pacemaker may be required. Other causes include ischemia to the heart muscle
or diseases of the heart vessels or valves. External causes include metabolic disorders, pathologies of the endocrine

heart palpations, chest pain, or fainting (syncope). While tachycardia is defined as a HR above 100 bpm, there is
considerable variation among people. Further, the normal resting HRs of children are often above 100 bpm, but
this is not considered to be tachycardia Many causes of tachycardia may be benign, but the condition may also be
correlatedwithfever,anemia,hypoxia,hyperthyroidism,hypersecretionofcatecholamines,somecardiomyopathies,
some disorders of the valves, and acute exposure to radiation. Elevated rates in an exercising or resting patient are
