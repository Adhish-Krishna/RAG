"Autonomic Nervous System
Approximately 33 percent of people experience a mild problem with motion sickness, whereas up to 66 percent
experience motion sickness under extreme conditions, such as being on a tossing boat with no view of the horizon.
Connections between regions in the brain stem and the autonomic system result in the symptoms of nausea, cold
sweats, and vomiting.
The part of the brain responsible for vomiting, or emesis, is known as the area postrema. It is located next
to the fourth ventricle and is not restricted by the blood–brain barrier, which allows it to respond to chemicals in
thebloodstream—namely,toxinsthatwillstimulateemesis.Therearesignificantconnectionsbetweenthisarea,the

Motion sickness is the result of conflicting information from the visual and vestibular systems. If motion is
perceived by the visual system without the complementary vestibular stimuli, or through vestibular stimuli without

Autonomic drugs are used to combat motion sickness. Though it is often described as a dangerous and deadly
drug, scopolamine is used to treat motion sickness. A popular treatment for motion sickness is the transdermal
scopolaminepatch.ScopolamineisoneofthesubstancesderivedfromtheAtropagenusalongwithatropine.Athigher
doses, those substances are thought to be poisonous and can lead to an extreme sympathetic syndrome. However,
the transdermal patch regulates the release of the drug, and the concentration is kept very low so that the dangers
are avoided. For those who are concerned about using “The Most Dangerous Drug,” as some websites will call it,

antihistamines such as dimenhydrinate (Dramamine ) can be used.",
