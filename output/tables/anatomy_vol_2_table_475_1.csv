this age is a theoretical limit to a healthy human lifespan.
Thymic involution has been observed in all vertebrate species that have a thymus gland. Animal studies have
shown that transplanted thymic grafts between inbred strains of mice involuted according to the age of the donor
and not of the recipient, implying the process is genetically programmed. There is evidence that the thymic
microenvironment,sovitaltothedevelopmentofnaïveTcells,losesthymicepithelialcellsaccordingtothedecreasing
expression of the FOXN1 gene with age.
It is also known that thymic involution can be altered by hormone levels. Sex hormones such as estrogen and
testosteroneenhanceinvolution,andthehormonalchangesinpregnantwomencauseatemporarythymicinvolution

What does all this tell us? Can we reverse immunosenescence, or at least slow it down? The potential is there for
