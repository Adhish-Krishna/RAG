by blood flowing at high pressure are also more likely to be injured—which means that hypertension can promote
arteriosclerosis, as well as result from it.

20.14).

Sometimes a plaque can rupture, causing microscopic tears in the artery wall that allow blood to leak into the
tissueontheotherside.Whenthishappens,plateletsrushtothesitetoclottheblood.Thisclotcanfurtherobstructthe

can break off and travel through the bloodstream as an embolus until it blocks a more distant, smaller artery.
Even without total blockage, vessel narrowing leads to ischemia—reduced blood flow—to the tissue region

Hypoxia involving cardiac muscle or brain tissue can lead to cell death and severe impairment of brain or heart
function.

Treatment includes lifestyle changes, such as weight loss, smoking cessation, regular exercise, and adoption of
a diet low in sodium and saturated fats. Medications to reduce cholesterol and blood pressure may be prescribed.
For blocked coronary arteries, surgery is warranted. In angioplasty, a catheter is inserted into the vessel at the point",
