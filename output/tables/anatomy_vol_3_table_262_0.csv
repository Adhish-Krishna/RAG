with human papillomavirus (HPV). There are over 100 related viruses in the HPV family, and the characteristics of
each strain determine the outcome of the infection. In all cases, the virus enters body cells and uses its own genetic
material to take over the host cell’s metabolic machinery and produce more virus particles.
HPV infections are common in both men and women. Indeed, a recent study determined that 42.5 percent of

HPV strains are classified as high or low risk according to their potential to cause cancer. Though most HPV
infections do not cause disease, the disruption of normal cellular functions in the low-risk forms of HPV can cause

Figure 27.16 Development of Cervical Cancer In most cases, cells infected with the HPV virus heal on their
own. In some cases, however, the virus continues to spread and becomes an invasive cancer.
When the high-risk types of HPV enter a cell, two viral proteins are used to neutralize proteins that the host
cells use as checkpoints in the cell cycle. The best studied of these proteins is p53. In a normal cell, p53 detects
DNAdamage in the cell’sgenome and either halts the progression ofthe cell cycle—allowing time forDNArepair
to occur—or initiates apoptosis. Both of these processes prevent the accumulation of mutations in a cell’s genome.

The prevalence of cervical cancer in the United States is very low because of regular screening exams called
pap smears. Pap smears sample cells of the cervix, allowing the detection of abnormal cells. If pre-cancerous cells

danger. However, women in developing countries often do not have access to regular pap smears. As a result, these
women account for as many as 80 percent of the cases of cervical cancer worldwide.
In 2006, the first vaccine against the high-risk types of HPV was approved. There are now two HPV vaccines
available:Gardasil®andCervarix®.Whereasthesevaccineswereinitiallyonlytargetedforwomen,becauseHPVis",
