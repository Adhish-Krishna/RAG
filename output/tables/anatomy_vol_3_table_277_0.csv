A typical IVF procedure begins with egg collection. A normal ovulation cycle produces only one oocyte, but
the number can be boosted significantly (to 10–20 oocytes) by administering a short course of gonadotropins. The

Next, the eggs and sperm are mixed in a petri dish. The ideal ratio is 75,000 sperm to one egg. If there are

intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).
