any instruments except for a stethoscope. A convenient way to remember the five scoring criteria is to apply the
mnemonic APGAR, for“appearance” (skin color), “pulse” (heart rate), “grimace” (reflex), “activity” (muscle tone),
and “respiration.”
Of the five Apgar criteria, heart rate and respiration are the most critical. Poor scores for either of these
measurementsmayindicatetheneedforimmediatemedicalattentiontoresuscitateorstabilizethenewborn.Ingeneral,
any score lower than 7 at the 5-minute mark indicates that medical assistance may be needed. A total score below
5 indicates an emergency situation. Normally, a newborn will get an intermediate score of 1 for some of the Apgar
criteria and will progress to a 2 by the 5-minute assessment. Scores of 8 or above are normal."
