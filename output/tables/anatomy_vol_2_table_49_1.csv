causes depolarization.
Muscarinic receptors
can cause both
depolarization or
hyperpolarization
depending on the
subtype.","Glu receptors
cause
depolarization.
Gly and GABA
receptors cause
hyperpolarization.","Depolarization or
hyperpolarization
depends on the specific
receptor. For example, D1
receptors cause
depolarization and D2
receptors cause
hyperpolarization.",
