"Phlebotomy and Medical Lab Technology
Phlebotomists are professionals trained to draw blood (phleb- = “a blood vessel”; -tomy = “to cut”). When more
than a few drops of blood are required, phlebotomists perform a venipuncture, typically of a surface vein in the
arm. They perform a capillary stick on a finger, an earlobe, or the heel of an infant when only a small quantity of
bloodisrequired.Anarterialstickiscollectedfromanarteryandusedtoanalyzebloodgases.Aftercollection,the

Medical or clinical laboratories employ a variety of individuals in technical positions:
• Medical technologists (MT), also known as clinicallaboratory technologists (CLT), typicallyhold a bachelor’s
degree and certification from an accredited training program. They perform a wide variety of tests on various
body fluids, including blood. The information they provide is essential to the primary care providers in
determining a diagnosis and in monitoring the course of a disease and response to treatment.
• Medical laboratory technicians (MLT) typically have an associate’s degree but may perform duties similar to
those of an MT.
