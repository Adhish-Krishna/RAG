"Orthostatic Hypotension
Have you ever stood up quickly and felt dizzy for a moment? This is because, for one reason or another, blood is

Whenapersonstandsup,proprioceptorsindicatethatthebodyischangingposition.AsignalgoestotheCNS,which
then sends a signal to the upper thoracic spinal cord neurons of the sympathetic division. The sympathetic system
then causes the heart to beat faster and the blood vessels to constrict. Both changes will make it possible for the

the internal branch of the carotid arteries into the brain, against the force of gravity. Gravity is not increasing while

keeps the brain well oxygenated so that cognitive and other neural processes are not interrupted.
Sometimes this does not work properly. If the sympathetic system cannot increase cardiac output, then blood

is orthostatic hypotension, which means that blood pressure goes below the homeostatic set point when standing. It

it may be the result of an underlying cause.
There are two basic reasons that orthostatic hypotension can occur. First, blood volume is too low and the
sympathetic reflex is not effective. This hypovolemia may be the result of dehydration or medications that affect
fluidbalance,suchasdiureticsorvasodilators.Bothofthesemedicationsaremeanttolowerbloodpressure,which

Sometimes increasing fluid intake or water retention through salt intake can improve the situation.
The second underlying cause of orthostatic hypotension is autonomic failure. There are several disorders that

Getting blood glucose levels under control can improve neurological deficits associated with diabetes."
