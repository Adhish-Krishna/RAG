However, we can perceive depth. How is that accomplished?
Two ways in which we can extract depth information from the two-dimensional retinal signal are based on
monocular cues and binocular cues, respectively. Monocular depth cues are those that are the result of information
within the two-dimensional visual field. One object that overlaps another object has to be in front. Relative size
differences are also a cue. For example, if a basketball appears larger than the basket, then the basket must be
furtheraway.Onthebasisofexperience,wecanestimatehowfarawaythebasketis.Binoculardepthcuescompare
information represented in the two retinae because they do not see the visual field exactly the same.
