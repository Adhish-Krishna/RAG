"Repair and Replacement
Damaged cardiac muscle cells have extremely limited abilities to repair themselves or to replace dead cells via
mitosis. Recent evidence indicates that at least some stem cells remain within the heart that continue to divide and
at least potentially replace these dead cells. However, newly formed or repaired cells are rarely as functional as the
original cells, and cardiac function is reduced. In the event of a heart attack or MI, dead cells are often replaced
by patches of scar tissue. Autopsies performed on individuals who had successfully received heart transplants show
some proliferation of original cells. If researchers can unlock the mechanism that generates new cells and restore
full mitotic capabilities to heart muscle, the prognosis for heart attack survivors will be greatly enhanced. To date,
