Asthma is a chronic disease characterized by inflammation and edema of the airway, and bronchospasms (that
is, constriction of the bronchioles), which can inhibit air from entering the lungs. In addition, excessive mucus
secretioncanoccur,whichfurthercontributestoairwayocclusion(Figure22.12).Cellsoftheimmunesystem,such
as eosinophils and mononuclear cells, may also be involved in infiltrating the walls of the bronchi and bronchioles.
Bronchospasmsoccurperiodicallyandleadtoan“asthmaattack.”Anattackmaybetriggeredbyenvironmental
factors such as dust, pollen, pet hair, or dander, changes in the weather, mold, tobacco smoke, and respiratory
infections, or by exercise and stress.

Symptoms of an asthma attack involve coughing, shortness of breath, wheezing, and tightness of the chest.

In many cases, the underlying cause of the condition is unknown. However, recent research has demonstrated
