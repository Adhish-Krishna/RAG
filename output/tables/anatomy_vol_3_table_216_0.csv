"Fluid Balance: Edema
Edema is the accumulation of excess water in the tissues. It is most common in the soft tissues of the extremities.

Pulmonary edema is excess fluid in the air sacs of the lungs, a common symptom of heart and/or kidney
failure.Peoplewithpulmonaryedemalikelywillexperiencedifficultybreathing,andtheymayexperiencechestpain.
Pulmonary edema can be life threatening, because it compromises gas exchange in the lungs, and anyone having
symptoms should immediately seek medical care.
Inpulmonary edema resulting fromheart failure, excessive leakage ofwater occursbecause fluidsget“backed

still coming in from the pulmonary arteries, causes fluid to be pushed out of them and into lung tissues.
Other causes of edema include damage to blood vessels and/or lymphatic vessels, or a decrease in osmotic
pressure in chronic and severe liver disease, where the liver is unable to manufacture plasma proteins (Figure
26.9). A decrease in the normal levels of plasma proteins results in a decrease of colloid osmotic pressure (which
counterbalances the hydrostatic pressure) in the capillaries. This process causes loss of water from the blood to the
surrounding tissues, resulting in edema.

Mild, transient edema of the feet and legs may be caused by sitting or standing in the same position for long
periods of time, as in the work of a toll collector or a supermarket cashier. This is because deep veins in the lower
limbsrelyonskeletalmusclecontractionstopushontheveinsandthus“pump”bloodbacktotheheart.Otherwise,
the venous blood pools in the lower limbs and can leak into surrounding tissues.
Medicationsthatcanresultinedemaincludevasodilators,calciumchannelblockersusedtotreathypertension,
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, estrogen therapies, and some diabetes medications. Underlying medical
conditionsthatcancontributetoedemaincludecongestiveheartfailure,kidneydamageandkidneydisease,disorders
that affect the veins of the legs, and cirrhosis and other liver disorders.
Therapy for edema usually focuses on elimination of the cause. Activities that can reduce the effects of the
condition include appropriate exercises to keep the blood and lymph flowing through the affected areas. Other
therapiesincludeelevationoftheaffectedparttoassistdrainage,massageandcompressionoftheareastomovethe
fluid out of the tissues, and decreased salt intake to decrease sodium and water retention.",
