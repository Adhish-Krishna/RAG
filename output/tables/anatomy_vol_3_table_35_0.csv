A hyperbaric chamber is a unit that can be sealed and expose a patient to either 100 percent oxygen with increased
pressure or a mixture of gases that includes a higher concentration of oxygen than normal atmospheric air, also at
a higher partial pressure than the atmosphere. There are two major types of chambers: monoplace and multiplace.
Monoplace chambers are typically for one patient, and the staff tending to the patient observes the patient from
outside of the chamber (Figure 22.24). Some facilities have special monoplace hyperbaric chambers that allow
multiple patients to be treated at once, usually in a sitting or reclining position, to help ease feelings of isolation or
claustrophobia. Multiplace chambers are large enough for multiple patients to be treated at one time, and the staff

Hyperbaric chamber treatment is based on the behavior of gases. As you recall, gases move from a region of
higher partial pressure to a region of lower partial pressure. In a hyperbaric chamber, the atmospheric pressure is

infections, and carbon monoxide poisoning. Exposure to and poisoning by carbon monoxide is difficult to reverse,
because hemoglobin’s affinity for carbon monoxide is much stronger than its affinity for oxygen, causing carbon
