"Fight or Flight? What About Fright and Freeze?
Theoriginalusageoftheepithet“fightorflight”comesfromascientistnamedWalterCannonwhoworkedatHarvard
in 1915. The concept of homeostasis and the functioning of the sympathetic system had been introduced in France
in the previous century. Cannon expanded the idea, and introduced the idea that an animal responds to a threat by
preparing to stand and fight or run away. The nature of this response was thoroughly explained in a book on the
physiology of pain, hunger, fear, and rage.
