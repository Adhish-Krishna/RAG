Elsewhere in the body, cells rely on carbohydrates, lipids, or amino acids to power mitochondrial ATP production.
But the CNS does not store lipids in adipocytes (fat cells) as an energy reserve. The lipids in the CNS are in the
cell membranes of neurons and glial cells, notably as an integral component of myelin. Proteins in the CNS are
crucial to neuronal function, in roles such as channels for electrical signaling or as part of the cytoskeleton. Those
macromolecules are not used to power mitochondrial ATP production in neurons."
