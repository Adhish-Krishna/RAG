infarction).
The disease progresses slowly and often begins in children and can be seen as fatty “streaks” in the vessels. It
thengraduallyprogressesthroughoutlife.Well-documentedriskfactorsincludesmoking,familyhistory,hypertension,
obesity, diabetes, high alcohol consumption, lack of exercise, stress, and hyperlipidemia or high circulating levels
of lipids in the blood. Treatments may include medication, changes to diet and exercise, angioplasty with a balloon
catheter, insertion of a stent, or coronary bypass procedure.
