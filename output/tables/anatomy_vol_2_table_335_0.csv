"Heart: Heart Defects
One very common form of interatrial septum pathology is patent foramen ovale, which occurs when the septum

“open.”Itmaybebenignorasymptomatic,perhapsneverbeingdiagnosed,orinextremecases,itmayrequiresurgical
repair to close the opening permanently. As much as 20–25 percent of the general population may have a patent

surgery is performed, the better the chance of survival.
A patent ductus arteriosus is a congenital condition in which the ductus arteriosus fails to close. The condition
may range from severe to benign. Failure of the ductus arteriosus to close results in blood flowing from the higher
pressure aorta into the lower pressure pulmonary trunk. This additional fluid moving toward the lungs increases
pulmonary pressure and makes respiration difficult. Symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnea), tachycardia,
enlarged heart, a widened pulse pressure, and poor weight gain in infants. Treatments include surgical closure
(ligation), manual closure using platinum coils or specialized mesh inserted via the femoral artery or vein, or
nonsteroidalanti-inflammatorydrugstoblockthesynthesisofprostaglandinE2,whichmaintainsthevesselinanopen
position. If untreated, the condition can result in congestive heart failure.

In the case of severe septal defects, including both tetralogy of Fallot and patent foramen ovale, failure of the
heart to develop properly can lead to a condition commonly known as a “blue baby.” Regardless of normal skin
