"How Stress Affects the Immune Response: The Connections
between the Immune, Nervous, and Endocrine Systems of the
Body

focusing on the connections between the immune system, the central nervous system, and the endocrine system
have led to a new science with the unwieldy name of called psychoneuroimmunology. The physical connections

from the adaptive immune response, however, causes its own share of problems in fighting disease.
Chronic stress, unlike short-term stress, may inhibit immune responses even in otherwise healthy adults. The
suppression of both innate and adaptive immune responses is clearly associated with increases in some diseases, as
seen when individuals lose a spouse or have other long-term stresses, such as taking care of a spouse with a fatal",,
