"The inability to recognize people by their faces is a troublesome problem. It can be caused by trauma, or it may be
inborn. Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/faces) to learn more about a person who lost the ability to
recognize faces as the result of an injury. She cannot recognize the faces of close family members or herself. What
