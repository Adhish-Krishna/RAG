"Developing Fetus
Throughout the second half of gestation, the fetal intestines accumulate a tarry, greenish black meconium. The
newborn’s first stools consist almost entirely of meconium; they later transition to seedy yellow stools or slightly
formed tan stools as meconium is cleared and replaced with digested breast milk or formula, respectively. Unlike

percent of births, the fetus has a bowel movement in utero, which can cause major complications in the newborn.
Thepassageofmeconiumintheuterussignalsfetaldistress,particularlyfetalhypoxia(i.e.,oxygendeprivation).
This may be caused by maternal drug abuse (especially tobacco or cocaine), maternal hypertension, depletion of

to the fetus. Meconium passage is typically a complication of full-term or post-term newborns because it is rarely
passed before 34 weeks of gestation, when the gastrointestinal system has matured and is appropriately controlled
by nervous system stimuli. Fetal distress can stimulate the vagus nerve to trigger gastrointestinal peristalsis and
relaxationoftheanalsphincter.Notably,fetalhypoxicstressalsoinducesagaspingreflex,increasingthelikelihood
that meconium will be inhaled into the fetal lungs.
Although meconium is a sterile substance, it interferes with the antibiotic properties of the amniotic fluid and
makes the newborn and mother more vulnerable to bacterial infections at birth and during the perinatal period.
Specifically,inflammationofthefetalmembranes,inflammationoftheuterinelining,orneonatalsepsis(infectionin
the newborn) may occur. Meconium also irritates delicate fetal skin and can cause a rash.
The first sign that a fetus has passed meconium usually does not come until childbirth, when the amniotic sac
ruptures.Normalamnioticfluidisclearandwatery,butamnioticfluidinwhichmeconiumhasbeenpassedisstained
