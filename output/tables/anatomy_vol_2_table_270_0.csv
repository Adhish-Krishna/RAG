"Endocrine System: Diabetes Mellitus
Dysfunction of insulin production and secretion, as well as the target cells’ responsiveness to insulin, can lead to a
condition called diabetes mellitus. An increasingly common disease, diabetes mellitus has been diagnosed in more
than18millionadultsintheUnitedStates,andmorethan200,000children.Itisestimatedthatupto7millionmore
adults have the condition but have not been diagnosed. In addition, approximately 79 million people in the US are
estimatedtohavepre-diabetes,aconditioninwhichbloodglucoselevelsareabnormallyhigh,butnotyethighenough
to be classified as diabetes.

do not produce insulin; thus, synthetic insulin must be administered by injection or infusion. This form of diabetes
accounts for less than five percent of all diabetes cases.
Type 2 diabetes accounts for approximately 95 percent of all cases. It is acquired, and lifestyle factors such as
poordiet,inactivity,andthepresenceofpre-diabetesgreatlyincreaseaperson’srisk.About80to90percentofpeople
with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese. In type 2 diabetes, cells become resistant to the effects of insulin. In

however, if blood glucose levels cannot be controlled, the diabetic will eventually require insulin.

pathway that results in the increased production of ketone bodies (or ketones), which are acidic. The build-up of
ketones in the blood causes ketoacidosis, which—if left untreated—may lead to a life-threatening “diabetic coma.”
Together, these complications make diabetes the seventh leading cause of death in the United States.
