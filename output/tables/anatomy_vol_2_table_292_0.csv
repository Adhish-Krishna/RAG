from the recipient (autologous) or from a donor with compatible blood (homologous). This practice was aided by
thewell-developedtechniquesofharvesting,concentrating,andfreezingoftheRBCsthatcouldbelaterthawedand
injected, yet still retain their functionality. These practices are considered illegal in virtually all sports and run the
riskofinfection,significantlyincreasingtheviscosityofthebloodandthepotentialfortransmissionofblood-borne
pathogens if the blood was collected from another individual.

is injected under the skin and can increase hematocrit for many weeks. It may also induce polycythemia and raise
hematocrit to 70 or greater. This increased viscosity raises the resistance of the blood and forces the heart to pump
morepowerfully;in extremecases, ithas resultedin death.Other drugs such as cobaltII chloridehavebeenshown
to increase natural EPO gene expression. Blood doping has become problematic in many sports, especially cycling.
Lance Armstrong, winner of seven Tour de France and many other cycling titles, was stripped of his victories and
admitted to blood doping in 2013.",,
