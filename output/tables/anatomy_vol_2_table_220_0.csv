"Spinal Cord
In certain situations, such as a motorcycle accident, only half of the spinal cord may be damaged in what is known
asahemisection.Forcefultraumatothetrunkmaycauseribsorvertebraetofracture,anddebriscancrushorsection

The ascending tracts in the spinal cord are segregated between the dorsal column and spinothalamic pathways.
Thismeansthatthesensorydeficitswillbebasedontheparticularsensoryinformationeachpathwayconveys.Sensory
discrimination between touch and painful stimuli will illustrate the difference in how these pathways divide these
functions.

On the functional leg, the opposite is true. The reason for this is that the dorsal column pathway ascends ipsilateral
