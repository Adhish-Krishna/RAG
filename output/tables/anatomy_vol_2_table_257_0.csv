"Endocrine System: Iodine Deficiency, Hypothyroidism, and
Hyperthyroidism
Asdiscussedabove,dietaryiodineisrequiredforthesynthesisofT3andT4.Butformuchoftheworld’spopulation,
foods do not provide adequate levels of this mineral, because the amount varies according to the level in the soil in
which the food was grown, as well as the irrigation and fertilizers used. Marine fish and shrimp tend to have high

Dietary iodine deficiency can result in the impaired ability to synthesize T3 and T4, leading to a variety of
severe disorders. When T3 and T4 cannot be produced, TSH is secreted in increasing amounts. As a result of this
hyperstimulation, thyroglobulin accumulates in the thyroid gland follicles, increasing their deposits of colloid. The
accumulation of colloid increases the overall size of the thyroid gland, a condition called a goiter (Figure 17.14).
A goiter is only a visible indication of the deficiency. Other iodine deficiency disorders include impaired growth
anddevelopment,decreasedfertility,andprenatalandinfantdeath.Moreover,iodinedeficiencyistheprimarycause

gland is the more common cause of low blood levels of thyroid hormones. Called hypothyroidism, the condition
is characterized by a low metabolic rate, weight gain, cold extremities, constipation, reduced libido, menstrual
irregularities, and reduced mental activity. In contrast, hyperthyroidism—an abnormally elevated blood level of
thyroidhormones—isoftencausedbyapituitaryorthyroidtumor.InGraves’disease,thehyperthyroidstateresults
