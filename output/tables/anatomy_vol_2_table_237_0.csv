"Endocrinologist
Endocrinology is a specialty in the field of medicine that focuses on the treatment of endocrine system disorders.
Endocrinologists—medical doctors who specialize in this field—are experts in treating diseases associated with
hormonal systems, ranging from thyroid disease to diabetes mellitus. Endocrine surgeons treat endocrine disease
through the removal, or resection, of the affected endocrine gland.
Patients who are referred to endocrinologists may have signs and symptoms or blood test results that suggest

blood tests to determine whether the patient’s hormonal levels are abnormal, or they may stimulate or suppress the
function of the suspect endocrine gland and then have blood taken for analysis. Treatment varies according to the

affect growth and disorders of the thyroid gland that can result in a variety of metabolic problems.
Some patients experience health problems as a result of the normal decline in hormones that can accompany
aging. These patients can consult with an endocrinologist to weigh the risks and benefits of hormone replacement
therapy intended to boost their natural levels of reproductive hormones.
In addition to treating patients, endocrinologists may be involved in research to improve the understanding of
endocrine system disorders and develop new treatments for these diseases.",
