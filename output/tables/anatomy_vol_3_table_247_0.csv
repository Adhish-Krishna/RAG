Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a condition in which a man has difficulty either initiating or maintaining an erection.
Thecombinedprevalenceofminimal,moderate,andcompleteEDisapproximately40percentinmenatage40,and
reaches nearly 70 percent by 70 years of age. In addition to aging, ED is associated with diabetes, vascular disease,
psychiatricdisorders,prostatedisorders,theuseofsomedrugssuchascertainantidepressants,andproblemswiththe

in the vasodilation pathway and result in an inability to achieve an erection.
RecallthatthereleaseofNOinducesrelaxationofthesmoothmusclesthatsurroundthepenilearteries,leading
to the vasodilation necessary to achieve an erection. To reverse the process of vasodilation, an enzyme called
phosphodiesterase (PDE) degrades a key component of the NO signaling pathway called cGMP. There are several
different forms of this enzyme, and PDE type 5 is the type of PDE found in the tissues of the penis. Scientists
discovered that inhibiting PDE5 increases blood flow, and allows vasodilation of the penis to occur.
PDEs and the vasodilation signaling pathway are found in the vasculature in other parts of the body. In the
1990s, clinical trials of a PDE5 inhibitor called sildenafil were initiated to treat hypertension and angina pectoris
(chestpaincausedbypoorbloodflowthroughtheheart).Thetrialshowedthatthedrugwasnoteffectiveattreating
