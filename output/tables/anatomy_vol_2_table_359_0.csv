blood, the patient’s life may not be in immediate danger. Ventricular fibrillation (see Figure 19.25d) is a medical
emergency that requires life support, because the ventricles are not effectively pumping blood. In a hospital setting,
it is often described as “code blue.” If untreated for as little as a few minutes, ventricular fibrillation may lead to
brain death. The most common treatment is defibrillation, which uses special paddles to apply a charge to the heart
from an external electrical source in an attempt to establish a normal sinus rhythm (Figure 19.26). A defibrillator
