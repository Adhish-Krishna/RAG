"Mapping Human History with Mitochondrial DNA
WhenwetalkabouthumanDNA,we’reusuallyreferringtonuclearDNA;thatis,theDNAcoiledintochromosomal
bundles in the nucleus of our cells. We inherit half of our nuclear DNA from our father, and half from our mother.
However,mitochondrialDNA(mtDNA)comesonlyfromthemitochondriainthecytoplasmofthefatovumweinherit

37 genes.
Mutations (changes) in mtDNA occur spontaneously in a somewhat organized pattern at regular intervals in
human history. By analyzing these mutational relationships, researchers have been able to determine that we can all

This doesn’t mean that everyone’s mtDNA today looks exactly like that of our ancestral Eve. Because of the
