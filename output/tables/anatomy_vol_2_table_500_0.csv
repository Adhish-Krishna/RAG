“Washyourhands!”Parentshavebeentellingtheirchildrenthisforgenerations.Dirtyhandscanspreaddisease.But
is it possible to get rid of enough pathogens that children will never get sick? Are children who avoid exposure to
pathogens better off? The answers to both these questions appears to be no.
Antibacterial wipes, soaps, gels, and even toys with antibacterial substances embedded in their plastic are
ubiquitous in our society. Still, these products do not rid the skin and gastrointestinal tract of bacteria, and it would
be harmful to our health if they did. We need these nonpathogenic bacteria on and within our bodies to keep the

diseases. In fact, getting diseases such as chickenpox or measles later in life is much harder on the adult and are

children avoid some illnesses, but there are so many pathogens, we will never be immune to them all.
