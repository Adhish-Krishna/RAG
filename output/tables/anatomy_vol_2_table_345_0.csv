may be triggered by excessive exercise, in which the partially occluded artery is no longer able to pump sufficient
quantities of blood, or severe stress, which may induce spasm of the smooth muscle in the walls of the vessel.
InthecaseofacuteMI,thereisoftensuddenpainbeneaththesternum(retrosternalpain)calledanginapectoris,
often radiating down the left arm in males but not in female patients. Until this anomaly between the sexes was
discovered, many female patients suffering MIs were misdiagnosed and sent home. In addition, patients typically
present with difficulty breathing and shortness of breath (dyspnea), irregular heartbeat (palpations), nausea and
vomiting,sweating(diaphoresis),anxiety,andfainting(syncope),althoughnotallofthesesymptomsmaybepresent.
Manyofthesymptomsaresharedwithothermedicalconditions,includinganxietyattacksandsimpleindigestion,so
differential diagnosis is critical. It is estimated that between 22 and 64 percent of MIs present without any symptoms.
An MI can be confirmed by examining the patient’s ECG, which frequently reveals alterations in the ST and
Qcomponents.SomeclassificationschemesofMIarereferredtoasST-elevatedMI(STEMI)andnon-elevatedMI
(non-STEMI). In addition, echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may be employed. Common
bloodtestsindicatinganMIincludeelevatedlevelsofcreatinekinaseMB(anenzymethatcatalyzestheconversion
ofcreatinetophosphocreatine,consumingATP)andcardiactroponin(theregulatoryproteinformusclecontraction),
both of which are released by damaged cardiac muscle cells.

MIs may trigger cardiac arrest, but the two are not synonymous. Important risk factors for MI include
cardiovasculardisease,age,smoking,highbloodlevelsofthelow-densitylipoprotein(LDL,oftenreferredtoas“bad”
cholesterol), low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL, or “good” cholesterol), hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
obesity, lack of physical exercise, chronic kidney disease, excessive alcohol consumption, and use of illegal drugs.",,
