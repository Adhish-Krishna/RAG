"Exercise and the Autonomic System
In addition to its association with the fight-or-flight response and rest-and-digest functions, the autonomic system
is responsible for certain everyday functions. For example, it comes into play when homeostatic mechanisms
dynamicallychange,suchasthephysiologicalchangesthataccompanyexercise.Gettingonthetreadmillandputting

and the digestivesystem to suspend activity. These are the same physiologicalchanges associatedwith the fight-or-
flight response, but there is nothing chasing you on that treadmill.
