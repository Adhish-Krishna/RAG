Thesupplyofbloodtothebrainiscrucialtoitsabilitytoperformmanyfunctions.Withoutasteadysupplyofoxygen,
and to a lesser extent glucose, the nervous tissue in the brain cannot keep up its extensive electrical activity. These
nutrients get into the brain through the blood, and if blood flow is interrupted, neurological function is compromised.

Sometimes, seemingly unrelated functions will be lost because they are dependent on structures in the same region.
Along with the swallowing in the previous example, a stroke in that region could affect sensory functions from the
