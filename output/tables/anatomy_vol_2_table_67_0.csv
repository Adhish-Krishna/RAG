tissues are dependent on the correct development of the tube. The connective tissues surrounding the CNS can be
involved as well.
There are three classes of this disorder: occulta, meningocele, and myelomeningocele (Figure 13.5). The first
type, spina bifida occulta, is the mildest because the vertebral bones do not fully surround the spinal cord, but the
spinalcorditselfisnotaffected.Nofunctionaldifferencesmaybenoticed,whichiswhatthewordoccultameans;it

neurological symptoms can be present.

with meningocele, surgery will alleviate the pain, although they may experience some functional loss. Because the
