the lack of estrogens that leads to the symptoms of menopause.
The earliest changes occur during the menopausal transition, often referred to as peri-menopause, when a
women’s cycle becomes irregular but does not stop entirely. Although the levels of estrogen are still nearly the
same as before the transition, the level of progesterone produced by the corpus luteum is reduced. This decline in

that occur are hot flashes and night sweats, trouble sleeping, vaginal dryness, mood swings, difficulty focusing, and
thinning of hair on the head along with the growth of more hair on the face. Depending on the individual, these
symptoms can be entirely absent, moderate, or severe.
After menopause, lower amounts of estrogens can lead to other changes. Cardiovascular disease becomes as
prevalentinwomenasinmen,possiblybecauseestrogensreducetheamountofcholesterolinthebloodvessels.When
estrogenislacking,manywomenfindthattheysuddenlyhaveproblemswithhighcholesterolandthecardiovascular
issues that accompany it. Osteoporosis is another problem because bone density decreases rapidly in the first years
after menopause. The reduction in bone density leads to a higher incidence of fractures.
