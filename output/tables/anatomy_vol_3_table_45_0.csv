"Respiratory System: Respiratory Distress Syndrome
Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) primarily occurs ininfants bornprematurely.Upto50percent ofinfants born
between 26 and 28 weeks and fewer than 30 percent of infants born between 30 and 31 weeks develop RDS. RDS
results from insufficient production of pulmonary surfactant, thereby preventing the lungs from properly inflating
at birth. A small amount of pulmonary surfactant is produced beginning at around 20 weeks; however, this is not
sufficientforinflationofthelungs.Asaresult,dyspneaoccursandgasexchangecannotbeperformedproperly.Blood
oxygen levels are low, whereas blood carbon dioxide levels and pH are high.
The primary cause of RDS is premature birth, which may be due to a variety of known or unknown causes.
Other risk factors include gestational diabetes, cesarean delivery, second-born twins, and family history of RDS.
The presence of RDS can lead to other serious disorders, such as septicemia (infection of the blood) or pulmonary
hemorrhage.Therefore,itisimportantthatRDSisimmediatelyrecognizedandtreatedtopreventdeathandreducethe

Medical advances have resulted in an improved ability to treat RDS and support the infant until proper lung

may be required. In addition, pulmonary surfactant is typically administered. Death due to RDS has been reduced
by 50 percent due to the introduction of pulmonary surfactant therapy. Other therapies may include corticosteroids,
supplemental oxygen, and assisted ventilation. Supportive therapies, such as temperature regulation, nutritional
support, and antibiotics, may be administered to the premature infant as well.",
