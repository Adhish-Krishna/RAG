"Cardiologist
Cardiologists are medical doctors that specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the heart. After
completing 4 years of medical school, cardiologists complete a three-year residency in internal medicine followed
by an additional three or more years in cardiology. Following this 10-year period of medical training and clinical
experience, they qualify for a rigorous two-day examination administered by the Board of Internal Medicine that
tests their academic training and clinical abilities, including diagnostics and treatment. After successful completion
of this examination, a physician becomes a board-certified cardiologist. Some board-certified cardiologists may
be invited to become a Fellow of the American College of Cardiology (FACC). This professional recognition is
