cells,isknownasanectopicfocusorectopicpacemaker.Anectopicfocusmaybestimulatedbylocalizedischemia;
exposure to certain drugs, including caffeine, digitalis, or acetylcholine; elevated stimulation by both sympathetic
or parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system; or a number of disease or pathological conditions.
Occasional occurances are generally transitory and nonlife threatening, but if the condition becomes chronic, it
may lead to either an arrhythmia, a deviation from the normal pattern of impulse conduction and contraction, or to
fibrillation, an uncoordinated beating of the heart.
While interpretation of an ECG is possible and extremely valuable after some training, a full understanding of
the complexities and intricacies generally requires several years of experience. In general, the size of the electrical

when insufficient oxygen is being delivered to the myocardium. An elevation of the ST segment above baseline is
often seen in patients with an acute MI, and may appear depressed below the baseline when hypoxia is occurring.
As useful as analyzing these electrical recordings may be, there are limitations. For example, not all areas

requires further testing, such as an ultrasound test called an echocardiogram or nuclear medicine imaging. It is also
possible for there to be pulseless electrical activity, which will show up on an ECG tracing, although there is no
corresponding pumping action. Common abnormalities that may be detected by the ECGs are shown inFigure 19.25.",,
