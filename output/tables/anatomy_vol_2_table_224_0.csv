"The Field Sobriety Test
The neurological exam has been described as a clinical tool throughout this chapter. It is also useful in other ways.
A variation of the coordination exam is the Field Sobriety Test (FST) used to assess whether drivers are under the
influence of alcohol. The cerebellum is crucial for coordinated movements such as keeping balance while walking,
ormovingappendicularmusculatureonthebasisofproprioceptivefeedback.Thecerebellumisalsoverysensitiveto
ethanol, the particular type of alcohol found in beer, wine, and liquor.
Walking in a straight line involves comparing the motor command from the primary motor cortex to the
proprioceptiveandvestibularsensoryfeedback,aswellasfollowingthevisualguideofthewhitelineonthesideofthe

Reciting the alphabet backwards is not always a component of the FST, but its relationship to neurological
function is interesting. There is a cognitive aspect to remembering how the alphabet goes and how to recite it
