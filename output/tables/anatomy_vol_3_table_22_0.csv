sidestream smoke have been identified that negatively impact human health, leading to the development of cancer
or other conditions, such as immune system dysfunction, liver toxicity, cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, and

cancer is increased by up to 30 percent in nonsmokers who live with an individual who smokes in the house, as
compared to nonsmokers who are not regularly exposed to second-hand smoke. Children are especially affected by
