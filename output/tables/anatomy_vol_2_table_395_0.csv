become visible on the surface of the integument. Varicose veins may occur in both sexes, but are more common in
women and are often related to pregnancy. More than simple cosmetic blemishes, varicose veins are often painful
and sometimes itchy or throbbing. Without treatment, they tend to grow worse over time. The use of support hose,
as well as elevating the feet and legs whenever possible, may be helpful in alleviating this condition. Laser surgery

conventional surgery to remove the damaged vessels. As there are typically redundant circulation patterns, that is,
anastomoses, for the smaller and more superficial veins, removal does not typically impair the circulation. There is
evidence that patients with varicose veins suffer a greater risk of developing a thrombus or clot.",
