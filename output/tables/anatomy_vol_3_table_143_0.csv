"Metabolism: Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiency and
Phenylketonuria
Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency (PDCD) and phenylketonuria (PKU) are genetic disorders. Pyruvate

PKU affects about 1 in every 15,000 births in the United States. People afflicted with PKU lack sufficient
activityoftheenzymephenylalaninehydroxylaseandarethereforeunabletobreakdownphenylalanineintotyrosine
adequately. Because of this, levels of phenylalanine rise to toxic levels in the body, which results in damage to
the central nervous system and brain. Symptoms include delayed neurological development, hyperactivity, mental
retardation, seizures, skin rash, tremors, and uncontrolled movements of the arms and legs. Pregnant women with
PKU are at a high risk for exposing the fetus to too much phenylalanine, which can cross the placenta and affect
fetal development. Babies exposed to excess phenylalanine in utero may present with heart defects, physical and/or
mental retardation, and microcephaly. Every infant in the United States and Canada is tested at birth to determine
whetherPKUispresent.Theearlieramodifieddietisbegun,thelessseverethesymptomswillbe.Thepersonmust
