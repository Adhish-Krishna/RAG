"The Myth of Left Brain/Right Brain
There is a persistent myth that people are “right-brained” or “left-brained,” which is an oversimplification of an
important concept about the cerebral hemispheres. There is some lateralizationof function, in which the left side of
the brain is devoted to language function and the right side is devoted to spatial and nonverbal reasoning. Whereas
thesefunctionsarepredominantlyassociatedwiththosesidesofthebrain,thereisnomonopolybyeithersideonthese
functions. Many pervasive functions, such as language, are distributed globally around the cerebrum.
