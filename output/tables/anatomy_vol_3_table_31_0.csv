experience a dry throat in the morning after waking from sleep, which may be due to excessive snoring.

In central sleep apnea, the respiratory centers of the brain do not respond properly to rising carbon dioxide

inspiration does not occur and breathing stops for a short period. In some cases, the cause of central sleep apnea
is unknown. However, some medical conditions, such as stroke and congestive heart failure, may cause damage to

centers, causing a decrease in the respiratory rate. The symptoms of central sleep apnea are similar to those of
obstructive sleep apnea.
A diagnosis of sleep apnea is usually done during a sleep study, where the patient is monitored in a sleep
laboratory for several nights. The patient’s blood oxygen levels, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure are
monitored,asarebrainactivityandthevolumeofairthatisinhaledandexhaled.Treatmentofsleepapneacommonly
