"The Pupillary Light Response
The autonomic control of pupillary size in response to a bright light involves the sensory input of the optic nerve

retina. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for dilating the pupil when light levels are low.
Shining light in one eye will elicit constriction of both pupils. The efferent limb of the pupillary light reflex
is bilateral. Light shined in one eye causes a constriction of that pupil, as well as constriction of the contralateral
pupil.Shiningapenlightintheeyeofapatientisaveryartificialsituation,asbotheyesarenormallyexposedtothe
