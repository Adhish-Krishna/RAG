Theunderlyingcauseofsomeneurodegenerativediseases,suchasAlzheimer’sandParkinson’s,appearstoberelated
toproteins—specifically,toproteinsbehavingbadly.OneofthestrongesttheoriesofwhatcausesAlzheimer’sdisease
is based on the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques, dense conglomerations of a protein that is not functioning
correctly.Parkinson’sdiseaseislinkedtoanincreaseinaproteinknownasalpha-synucleinthatistoxictothecellsof
the substantia nigra nucleus in the midbrain.
For proteins to function correctly, they are dependent on their three-dimensional shape. The linear sequence of
amino acids folds into a three-dimensional shape that is based on the interactions between and among those amino
acids. When the folding is disturbed, and proteins take on a different shape, they stop functioning correctly. But the
